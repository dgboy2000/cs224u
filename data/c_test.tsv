1788	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 more and more people start to use computers, goes more and more into the dark aged. While computer @MONTH1 be helpful in some cases, they are also making people excercize less, most @CAPS1 many people are nature, and more people are becoming awkward. So are computer advancement recently worth society becoming less interactive? The answer is no. With more thing to do on the computer people arent getting enough exercize to keep up a healthy regimens. Kids would rather waste time on the computer than go out play. @NUM1 years ago, when most that many people had computers, you could see people outside playing and having fun with each other, But now, when you look outside, no one is on the local playground having fun and exercising, they are on the internet. ""@PERCENT1 of kids, who spend most of their time on the computer, are over-weight and unhealthy, compared to the @PERCENT2 of kids who are outside playing and a healthy weight."" says @PERSON1, @CAPS2. So really the problem to over-weight, its lack of exercize from the computers. Not only are people getting less exercize, they are also not experiencing the healty of nature. With less people going going outside, of exercize, waste nature healty because no-one gets to use it, and harm social skills and family relationships. So please, get off the computer and enjoy life."	1788	
1789	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 Time @CAPS1 me tell you what I think of computers there is nothing wrong with people being on computers. I say this because us as kids really do need computers for projects and school work. Also because what if your parents want to move or get a better job but have no car they can use they're computer. Computers actually help the human mind. If you get bored then get on the computer sit back and relax while I explain. In addition I'm not saying that you can use your computer for everything say for an example your teacher gives you an assignment and you can't find it in your book your going to use the computer. If you need pictures for a project but your not an very good artist then you can use your computer. so at the end computer's aren't so bad after all. For an example my mom doesn't have a car or know how to drive. So when she needs to look for a job and no one is there to take her she get's on the internet and find one. Also when it was time for her to move she got on the computer and found a @LOCATION1 house. So like I said computer's are not as bad as people think. When kid's get bored and it's snowing outside and nothing on t.v. Then they can go on the computer, it's not like they don't have educational sites. They have first in math and math for fun. So don't think it's just websites to chat with your friends. In conclusion don't make it seem as through the computer isn't useful because it is. The computer even teach's me things every now and then. So I would say computers @CAPS2! So don't be such a grumpy person because they probably help you sometimes."	1789	
1790	1	"Dear Local newspaper, Have you been spending a good portion of your time on computers? Do you think it is effecting you in anyway? Well in this writing piece I am going to tell you how I believe the computers effect you aand everyone else. My first piece of information for the way computers effect people is if they are on the omputer playing games, emailing or listening to music, that is more time you miss spending with thier family or going outside. If they miss time to spend with thier family then you could slowly start drifting apart from them, especially if they don't live near you. One day when that person passed away and you think back you are going to wish you weren't on the compuer three times they were over, you are going to wish you were down there spending time with them. If you miss going outside that is a whole new thing you are missing the sunshine, the snow or whatever kind of temparature there is outside and either way being outside in the fresh air is healthy and so much better than being inside on a computer. The second way computer could effect someones lifen is if you are in a chat room talking to someone and you don't know who it is you have no way to know for sure who you are talking to. It could be a creepy adult or a murder and you'd be thinking that it is a cod kid that wants to be your friends and you could end up letting some information slip. He could ask you to meet him somewhere and they could endup taking you forever and during that time you were talking to him you could of been doing something else than talk to some stranger on the computer. My last thing I believe that bthe computer has an effect on people is that they won't be us active. they'd be lounging around all day on the computer instead of playing a sport or running around outside. Who cares if you colud get hand eye coordination you can play @NUM1 @CAPS1-box with your family and still it's because you get hand eye coordination and youre spending time with family. Even better than that you could be palying outside with your family it will keep you extremely more active than anything and you will be able to spend time with your family. Now that I told you aall of those reasons the computers effect you should know now that spending time off the computer is much more healthier than sitting on the computer all day."	1790	
1791	1	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine how life would be if we all stop sitting on our behinds on the computer all day but enjoying mother nature? The issue is that experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think we should give the computers a break so that we @CAPS1 get enough excercise, so we @CAPS1 enjoy nature, and so that we @CAPS1 keep our knowledge. I think that we should give the computer a break so that we @CAPS1 start excercising. Who wouldn't want to excersize to stay in shape. I remember when me and my mom used to exercise once a day so that we @CAPS1 stay in good shape. Surely if you go on the computer everyday instead of exercising you will start to gain weight. Who would want to gain weight? Why should a person not exercise and stay healthy? Another reason why we should give computers a break is so that people @CAPS1 enjoy nature. For example, they @CAPS1 go to the park or even ride their bikes. In @ORGANIZATION1 school @PERCENT1 say that they love to ride their bike instead of going on the computer. Why not go outside and smell the fresh air, or even go swimming at the beach? Another reason we should give the computer a break is so that we @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. For example if you stay on the computer and play games you will lose your focus on work. Why should your parents be worried because their kids grades are slowly decreasing and decreasing every second. Why should smart kids get low grades over playing games on their computers? So now I say ""I wont waste my knowledge ever again"". It's now or never! Should kids give the computer a break or not. I think they should because they wont get enough exercise, so that the kids @CAPS1 enjoy mother nature. Also so that they @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. This is why kids should to focusing on computers. So why not go waisting your time and knowledge on computers now!"	1791	
1792	1	"Dear newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help with education believe it or not. They let people keep in touch with each other no matter where they are. Also computers help people with so many useful things. Education is a very important thing in life. And computers are a big part of education. In my school we do many things on the computer like typing papers, research projects, and sometimes even rests. Computers dont only help with education in school but at our own homes too. When your surfing the web you might come across articles of people and places and that helps your education. The computer is also a good place to learn about history, you can find out about the worlds history or maybe even your own family history. Computers can teach people a lot. Computers can also be helpful for peoples health if you use them the right way. Instead of looking up silly stuff look up what foods you can eat that are good for you and what you can do to stay healthy. You can look up recipes that are healthy and delicous. On the computer you can get tons of other peoples opinions on ways to stay healthy which is better than just getting our opinion from somebody you know. Computers can also help you excercise. You can find out different types of excercises and stretches. You can even watch excercising videos and follow along with them. Its possible that you find a video or type of excercise that works good for you. Instead of searching things on the internet that are not useful look up something important like your health. Computers are useful in thousands of different ways. One way is keeping in touch with people. I keep in touch with my friends by using facebook, myspace, and aim. A lot of other people use these sites to. These sites also help me keep in touch with my family. I talk to cousins that live a city down from mine and even my family members that live across the country and in another continent. Computers are also not just for the important things in life there to have fun too. There are millions of websites with games, jokes, and funny videos. There are so many uses for a computer. In conclusion computers have a very positive effect on people. They help children and adults with there education and learning. The internet can also help people live healthy so they can have a happy life. There are so many different uses of a computer, you can do almost anything on it. Computers can defenitely have a positive effect on people."	1792	
1793	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 the caveman found fire, ever, thought what would happen if he did not use it? Well that is where we are today. The computer is our fire. Some people might not be able to compare a computer to fire, but the advancement in technology is just about the same. There are now tons of people who use computer. I definetly agree that we should continue the use of computers. Computers help people learn, we can communicate better, and it will allow us to advance farther. The computer can help us learn. It can teach us about faraway places that we probably would never have known that they existed. We can learn about the weather better. If we did not did not have computers we would have never left earth. Or be able to make @CAPS2. The computer has already helped us a math teacher, @PERSON1 said"" Computers have boosted the kids knowledge @CAPS5 much. I never learned some of the stuff @CAPS1 i was growing up. This next generation will be the we have had yet."" @CAPS3 more than we could have alone, @CAPS5 why get rid of it? The computer can also help us communicate better and faster. which the avoke in the @LOCATION2 happened, it might have taken a weck or even a month for the @LOCATION1 to hear about it, and longer to try and go down to help. By then the people would have to try and fix it. it up themselves for two months or more. I remember yesterday. I had a board of education meeting to go to. It was really importan checking my @CAPS4-mails on the computer and I found out that i needed to go. It was better that i found out and not the next day @CAPS1 my boss was going to yell at me because i did not go. That is how useful the computer is to communicate. The computer is also goind to help us @CAPS3 farther. It is like the fire. It helped People @CAPS3 @CAPS5 much, @CAPS5 once the computer is at its peak, it will push us just as for the fire did. Survey shows that @PERCENT1 of the children population is already smarter than the adult population. @CAPS5 @CAPS1 the children become adults there is nothing this world cannot do. we would be able to colonize the galaxy! @CAPS5, as you can see, computers are more beneficial than bad. they help teach people new stuff, communicate faster and better, and will help us @CAPS3 farther. Think about it, millions of years from now, people will say, ""@CAPS6 if man never made computers, that would be worse than the fall of empire."" @CAPS7 you for taking the time to read this letter."	1793	
1794	1	"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 now is a letter to explain to us all, that computers are not a major destroyer of society. They don't just make people exercise less, they don't just make people interact less with family. They help so much, and not many people can see that. Computers are a wonderful thing to society. They help people make friends, they help with giving information, and they make our lives easier. For a start, computers are good because they introduce us to new people. For example, if you are shy or socially awkward, you know it's very hard to make new friends. However, with a computer you won't feel as shy, which helps make friends easily! Another example is that if no one wants to be your friend for your appearance, then the computer can help. You can make friends without being seen by them which is a great thing if you are emoarressed or being stopped by your appearance. Computers help make friends in many more ways as well. Therefore, computers are a great thing for a society. They also provide us information. Another reason why computers are a nice thing for our society, is that they give us info. If you need help on some work or a project, for example, you can find almost anything from the computer. maybe you even want to study for a test; you can study on the computers. Also, you can learn about any place in the world. If you need information of a hotel, you just want to learn or if you want to know about something that happened there, it's all on the computer. Even if you just wont the news of one place, you can find it with the computer. Thus, makes the computer a fantastic item that helps the society. Besides info, they make our lives easier. As my final reason, computers benefit society by making our lives easier to handle. Such a way they do this is that make files easier to make and organize. When writing something it might have mistakes and be harder to read, but computers show your mistakes and have easy to read fonts. My next example in that when you have something in real life it is so easy to lose or misplace. On the other hand, computers store whatever you upload, so they cant be lost. Something as important as pictures can be saved by adding them to your computers. As you can see, computers help the lives of all. Now you can agree with me when I say. Computers have a huge effect on society. They show us new people. They consist of much helpful info. They make."	1794	
1795	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there has been some talk about how computers are changing our world for the better. Computers are apparently the only way their we will survive in the future. This is nonsense! Computers are taking away our valuable sleep hours, our rights to a good education, and our health! Computers are in fact the way of the unhealthy future. I ask you to go ahead a think about the time you spend on the computer. The average teen in the year @DATE1 spent @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. Now compare that to the amount of time you spent as keep. Chances are high that you only get @NUM1 or @NUM3 hours asleep making the amount of time you spent going on the web and the amount of beauty set you got about the same. That right there should tell you, that something is arong with the computer lifestyle. We all fall victim to drowsiness.. every once in a while is alright. However, for every hour you spend on the computer your are @PERCENT1 sleeper then you were! @CAPS5 is the price of losing energy worth @CAPS4? Did you know that millions of people wake up as early as they can just to be playing on the computer. Some wake up as early as @NUM4 in the morning! Forgive me if I'mmistaken but @NUM4 o'clock in the morning just to talk on facebook is breaching insanity. Sleep is important @CAPS5 playing on the computer isn't worth our @NUM6's. Not only is losing precious sleep bed but now the devil's invention is deleting our education from our now computer operated minds! Ask any student how much time they spend studying the answer will be I don't need to study. ""@CAPS2 that sound right. Kids do need to study they just want to chat with friends online. The average students grade went down @PERCENT2 list year because of all the time spent on the computer. Speaking of the ever trendy online chat..how many time have you heard lol, omg, or @CAPS3? Well one things for sure @CAPS4 in papers, worksheets, and just about anything that a computer kids hands in! Another issue is that kids who don't care about school are effecting the thought of those who do. One kid said ""@CAPS4's only cool to talk online school is for."" This is the wrong message to send kids! School is cool. Finally computers are throwing away our health. More and more people are getting diseases because they spend too much time in front of the screens @PERCENT2 more people got diabetes last year do to lack of exercise. Playing sports has been proven as away to make a child more well rounded. Computers do net, @CAPS5 don't we want to un-plug ourselves and live dive into sports? Sports will also make your mind more fit. They will teach you to work as a team and not give in to peer pressure. @CAPS5 as you can see computers are lending this world down a dark road. @CAPS4's time we say enough and become unplugged! Our life shouldn't be compermised for time spent on the computer. These inventions are giving us less beauty sleep, throwing our education in the recycling bin, and giving us a life with our health! Stop this injustice and unplug that computer!"	1795	
1796	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I would like to complain about the everyday use of computers. I believe that now in days the use of computers are being abused. Many people use the computer and doesn’t spend time with the family. The everyday use of computers is also causing certain people to gain access weight. Another reason is that by staring at the screen can create eye damage! As you knew my first complaint is how by being on the computer s much it takes away time spent with family and friends. Most of the day you are on the computer gives no room for family time. So that for one is not a great thing. My second reason people shouldn't be on the computer so much is because it's causing people to gain access weight. By just sitting on the computer all day you get no exercise whatsoever, so you gain weight not wanted. The only thing your body that gets exercise while on the computer is your fingers. Also the human body needs exercise! My final reason that the computer shouldn't be in so much use is because it can cause eye damage. When your eyes look at the screen for a long period of time, they tend to strain. So this can cause your next trip to the eye doctor. Well I have explained all my reasons to you and I hope you understand. Computers are fun but you got to give them a rest sometimes unless you want to lose time with the family, gain weight, or maybe your next trip to the eye doctor then you might want to turn it off and go jogging, or camping with the family! Thank you for taking time off your schedule to read my complaints!"	1796	
1797	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 having kids wasting there whole lives by being on the computer to much. I sure wouldn’t want my son to be like that. Being on the computer too much can make you unhealthy from not exercising, not be able to enjoy nature, and keep you away from you friends and family. Not much good can came out of being on the computer @NUM1. Please newspaper take my word. @CAPS4 will make you well known @CAPS3 you agree with me on this. First of all, being on the computer all day, everyday can make you unhealthy by not exercising. @PERCENT2 of people that do not exercise live less longer to the people that do exercise. Times @CAPS2 said. “@CAPS3 you spend your life on the computer and don’t take a jog once in a while. Then @CAPS4 can hurt you body in a days, and way.” I believe that quote the @PERCENT1 @CAPS5. @PERSON2 stated to me, “@CAPS3 you can’t get off the computer, @CAPS4 can hurt your body badly and can make you less athletic because you are so used & not exercising, “@CAPS3 doctor said that you should believe @CAPS4 trust me this will be a great decision. You will see improvements everyday. Second of all. You won’t be to enjoy nature @CAPS3 you are on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of students that don’t get some fresh air once in a while can make them less with the worth. @CAPS5 @PERSON1 said, “ @CAPS3 you don’t pay attention to nature, then you won’t know anything about the earth and what have gone on “ that will not be helpful in your social studies class. Peoples @CAPS2 use said. “@CAPS7 on the computer and not enjoying the outdoors can actually make you less smarter on what you do. “I have even heard that same qoute from doctors, too my friend. Dive was a straight A student and very popular. He is a very tall and handsome kid. Then all of the sudden, one day he met a computer and invite sports and never went outside and @CAPS4 change him a lot. I would never want that to happen to me or any of my friends again. The is do you want to happen to you? Lastly computers can less interaction with friends and family. @PERCENT4 of students that still on the computer become less close with friends and even family. That is not a good thing at all. @CAPS5 @PERSON3 said, ""computer only cause mental and less interactions with friends & family at school. “@CAPS4 is very interesting that people still use computers after all of those reasons. The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 newspaper said, “computers decreasing bond of family and friends. “I agree with that statement the whole one yards. @CAPS4 is just very sad how people waste their lives doing same thing that is not good for them. Please make the next choice or @CAPS4 will be to late. To sum @CAPS4 all us. @CAPS1 children outside and could better. That can happen @CAPS3 you make the decision I am changing right now. @CAPS3 you don’t @CAPS4 can keep them from exercising, enjoying outdoors and nature, and interacting with family and friends. No one wants that, so please read my carefully newspaper make the decision and make @CAPS4 right."	1797	
1798	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 should think that computers are a good thing because this technology help people everyday in many different ways. Computers can allow you to have fun playing games, do research for work, @CAPS4 new people, and many businesses are built around computers. Lets think about how a computer can effect @CAPS3's life. A man or women goes to work and then goes to the computer. Well maybe this man is a scientist who is using the computer to save findings, help research new ones, and make calculations, @CAPS5 job depends on computers to discover new findings. The man might be a person who answers @NUM1 calls. @CAPS5 computer can help save lives by telling them where the person in need is calling from and how to get there. So these machines are powerful work resourses. Computers can also entertain people when they get bored. It is just like any other video game, you get to go online and play with friends or make new friends in the proses. If a person is bored and has nothing to do then they can hop on a computers go to a website or put in a @CAPS6 and play many fun games. It is a good way to learn and entertain in your free time. People will alway learn from computers. You can find interesting facts, how to build things or just about anything you can think of will be on the computer. Besides many schools use computers to help educate their students by using interactive game that aid many kids into learning more can just teach them in general. The people will always think for themselves and most will not give their computer just because someone says that it is bad for them. I have opened up to the people to try to convince them that computers are not us but they are doing quite the opposite and are helping us in everyday life. They help us Learn, have fun, and some people even depend on them to make a living. Thank You."	1798	
1799	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers, and other technology are very popular today. Many people look at computers saying well they are innapropriete the way children and young adults are using them. Well, those are only the negatives of computers there are many positive things in having a computer. Starting off with Online @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, learning about faraway places. Lastly, chatting online with family or friends. First off, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and online learning sites are populating more and more to this day. If our society didn't have online toutering or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 students wouldn't be able to learn up to their fullest potential. If a high amount of society didn't believe in online activities now would we as students get the knowledge we have now. Also, this online @CAPS2 is an opportunity for students to learn by themselves & classes that their school @MONTH1 not offer. If someone were to ever to take that away we would not be where we are today in this world because we would not have those people who went above and beyond in their learning due to society. Next, online chat is really big throughout our nation. This is an opportunity to talk with family members that live faraway. Also this is an opportunity to hook up with your old friends who @MONTH1 have moved away. About @PERCENT1 of our world looks at online chatrooms as being a bad influence on children when really the problem is the parents letting their (son/daughter) child use online chatroom who are immature. Lastly, online is a world to explore throughout. Just like the world we live in. You can go online and research any topic you want to such as culture through out our world. Different countries have different cultures and you can learn about them online. Also, you can find different attractions to different countries, states, counties and towns as well as book tours and go on trips to these places. Such as china you can start off by researching that country then you can go visit that country and see what you missed. There are many reasons to look at computers in a bad manor. I can see how: because people are taking advantage of technology and not using their own so it is brainwashing people and making @PERCENT2 of the people that use computer think one day nobody will live without using computers. There are many good reasons too have a computer. One is to advance your knowledge as far as you can. So why don't our society do so. And look at computer to @CAPS4 with peoples lives."	1799	
1800	1	"Why people should use computers? Computers are good for people because you have something else to do while your learning things you don't know. One of the reasons why computers are good for people is because, family, friends around the world, like if your in other country and you can't see your family or friends you will just go on the computer and video chat with them, if you wanna keep in touch with people that you know for a long time the computer could keep them intouch, if you miss someone and you dont have a phone the computer might be a great idea. Also it helps you on questions that you have, if you don't know a word you can go on @ORGANIZATION1 and you will find the defenition if the teachers gives you homework and its very hard and you can't find the answer on the book the computer have all the answers you need, if your friends say something about any subject and you have no idea what are they talking about you could go look it up and learn something new in life. In the computer you could see things before anyone does, like you could whatch videos over and over again to see what real happend. It give you the real apportunity to learn something new that you will remember all your life, but computers are not use all the time you could spend sometime outside and have fun also. Computers are good for you and help you in your homework or in things you don't know, and getting in touch with people you wanna see/talk, the computers are a lot of fun, but also spending time outside with other people could be very nice too."	1800	
1801	1	"@CAPS1, its time for supper! "@CAPS2 on, mom I have to update my facebook!" @CAPS3, times you as a reader, @MONTH1 have found yourself in a similar situation. Couped up in your basement updating friends spaces and playing games on your computer. You probably havent seen the sun in a few weeks, either. @CAPS3 argue this is bad because computers are addictive and restrict exersising, enjoying nature and social events such as family and friends. But is @CAPS9 really allthat bad? For instance, you can chat with people accross the globe, send and receive messages at breakreck speed, and learn things about farway places like the @ORGANIZATION5. this is where I stand on this contreversal debate. @CAPS6, @CAPS4 possibly the biggest thing since electricity. There are billions. No, @CAPS5 things to do on the @CAPS6 more other are being made each @CAPS14. Wether @CAPS9 be a fan site for people like @CAPS7.J sandwiches or a viral site such as @CAPS8 or myspace. And while @CAPS9 is addiding, @CAPS9 has @CAPS3 upsides to @CAPS9. @CAPS6 games help with hand-eye coordinating and @CAPS20 your ever sluck on homework. The @CAPS6 will teach you. This is only a small reason why computers are a good thing. @CAPS21 what @CAPS20 your computer doesn't support @CAPS6? what @CAPS9 good for? Nothing right? WRONG! The computer has installed apps such as the brain bending @CAPS10 sweeper, or the reaction testing pinball. Also, you can always install games like the @ORGANIZATION6 (real-time-strategy) @CAPS11, @ORGANIZATION2. this is on @ORGANIZATION3 the games, along with @ORGANIZATION3, and @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS12 that tasts how well your headership skills are along with money management, and planning. Furthermore, by buying old arcade games you can get to see what gaming was like "@CAPS13 in the @CAPS14". You can play old games such as @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION4, and @CAPS18-@CAPS19. @CAPS21 why is @CAPS9 @CAPS21 bad ? Hear this: (quote @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1) "@CAPS20 one is to stay on is to stay on the computer for @NUM1 hours a @CAPS14 for @NUM2 weeks, gain about @NUM3 pounds each week following." @CAPS21 yes. you should limit your computer time. but did you know that @NUM4 out @ORGANIZATION3 @NUM5 people who are on the computer for @NUM6 hours a @CAPS14 also gain increase in skills such as typing speed, knowledge coordination. This is @CAPS22. @CAPS21, @CAPS23, is @CAPS9 really that bad? To sum @CAPS9 @CAPS23 up. Computers are a good thing. Furthermore, you can exceed life skills such as planning, and money management. Also, you can have an aspect @ORGANIZATION3 what gaming was like @CAPS13 then white @CAPS9 is @CAPS24 to get to know your world and the people in @CAPS9, you should your computer time to @NUM5-4 hours a @CAPS14 which reminds me @ORGANIZATION3 the time that a person @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS25.K for @NUM3 hours streight. @CAPS24, but not a good @CAPS26. @CAPS21 go get a computer and @CAPS27!"	1801	
1802	1	"Dear local newspaper: I am writing this letter to tell you I think computers have a positive effect on people that they benifit in the society. I as a single person think computers benifit the society because they give people the ability to learn about faraway places, can let people talk and chat onlines with other people and can help with education. Now on to making sure you agree with me. First compouts can give people the ability to learn interesting facts on neat stuff about very faraway places that you have never ever herd of befor. For example once I had to do a movie on a forgive country that I knew nothing about so what did I do? I want to the computers. Thier I found many fact and data about the place. Now if I can do that you can to and it will be very quick and very easy. Secondly you can talk to people or live chat with people even if their miles away. Their is many different sites and places to chat too. Like me I go and talk to my friends on @CAPS1, or myspace oncwe in a while. Also lets say you haven'ts seen a relative in a while you realy want to see them. But its allmost impossible to well not anymore."	1802	
1803	1	"Effects of computers @CAPS1 local newspaper, Have you ever realized @CAPS7 computers effect you and the people around you? well, I think the effects come in a bad way. for example, you could get abducted from strangers online, your grades would slip, and you wouldnt be able to live you life like a kid or adult anymore. @CAPS7, you will see my first explanation. First, you could get abducted from strangers online. When you're in the chat rooms, where you shouldn't be in the first place, kids and adults tend to talk to strangers. then they start telling them where they live, when puts both you and your family in jeapordy. This way, you shouldn't stay on the computer for a long time, because then you would be tempted to talk in chat rooms. Here is my next reason. Next, your grades would slip. When you get home, all you think about is, ""@CAPS2's new on facebook."" @CAPS3, ""@CAPS2 can I buy @CAPS7, this isn't healthy. You should be doing your homework when you get home. @CAPS3, adults should be worrying about bills, not about the email they just got, @CAPS5 time flys when you're on the computer, theres no way anyone will have time to do anything. @CAPS3, when you're at school or work, all you can think about is going home playing that new game on you computer. How are you suppost to concentrate on anything once you have that on you mind. Here's my last reason, @CAPS6, you wouldn't be able to live you life like an adult or child anymore. When you're a kid, you usually like playing outside, or playing with your pets, friends, and family. Well, when you spend most of your time on the computer, how are you going to burn calories, and run around by getting you energy out. You might even be a bad influence on you brother and sister. Without any exercise isn't good for your body. for adults, they wouldn't have time to pay for bills or spend time with their family. The kids would have no father figure to talk to or a mom to disguse their problems, @CAPS7 you will see all of my reasoning. In conclusion, computers control you life. I think they are truly just a device to make you loose control of you life. You could get abducted, you grades could slip, and you wouldn't be able to live your life. As you can see they inform but control."	1803	
1804	1	"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 is an issue on where technology benefical to our society. @CAPS1 are many ways people could benefit from new and advanced technology, and @CAPS1 ways people cannot. In this letter, I will be describing to you, the type of ways people can benefit from technology. First of all, computers give students and adults a chance of having an education. For example, if a young girl has a child and can't afford to stay in school, online classes gives them the chance to care for their child and still receive an education. If an adult a degree online will help them achieve. People need, technology offer, to give it. Secondly, some people are that if someone is always online, they will and see. He for what it is. Have you thought the flip side of that will computers, people can still explore the world. You can work. Finally, computer help families stay in touch. Computers are a great way for people to stay communicated. For example, maybe your phone isnt working properly or maybe not even working at all and you want to contact a friend or relative, you can easily go online with chat or webcam, etc to keep them notified on anything important or just to say hello. Wouldn't you want to still to communicate with too? In conclusion, Technology is advancing more and more, all the time. It's only getting better. Online classes, exploration of the world, and communicating with fellow people are just some of the things technology can do. Wouldn't you want to experience some of the things it can do?"	1804	
1805	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Advances in technology can ruin the future of our children. A computer, a thing that most people have although it comes with very good things about it there is also a lot of negative things. A couple examples are people can become addicted to the computer. So they stay all up in their house, in their room, where their computer is. Another reason is the dangers of computers. With technology advancing the internet is very dangerous and you have to be careful what information you give out. And at last cyber bullies just like actually bullies but instead of physically hurting someone cyber bullies mentally and emotionally take someone down and hurt them. As you can see these are only a few reasons why technology is becoming dangerous thing and has a negative effect on people and their life. Physical exercise is a good thing, it is needed if you want to stay and be a healthy person. But you can't get out go for a run and get physical exercise if your on the computer doing whatever you do. So the computer is haveing a negative affect on people because they arent getting at side and enjoying the fresh air. Instead they are inside on the computer. Alot of people are gamers so they could be all caught up in a whole different. That's a bad thing. It's bad becasue some people get so addicted to a game they gte addicted and maybe even. So if you obssesed with something your go to do it all the time, so when your inside being obsseses with whatever your obssesed to stay healthy. There are many dangers on the computer. For example petifiles. Petifiles are always on the for young kids they. Petifies disguse themselves as most likely teenagers or people on their @NUM1's and they tride kids into meeting or with them so the kids think they're meeting up with a person they thaght the petifile is but really they are just doing in a trap and could end up in a very dangerous serious situation that could end up death or go missing and never seen again. And dangerous thing on the internet is atlkers. This world isnt a safe the world is a cold and deciving place they is filled with people who will hate you and people who are crazy. So you have to be carefull on what kind of information you put out on the internet because you never know you could be stalked and that's another very dangerous situation. The last reason I'm going to mention is cyber bullies some might say are almost worse than actual bullies because cyber bullies mentally attack you and hurt you instead of physically. They are very mean people who will do whatever it takes to take somebody down. An example of a bad ending to cyber buling was there was a kid. I knew his name was @PERSON1.Everybody thaght he was gay because he didnt football as a summer so this buly went on @CAPS1 and started argue called @PERSON1 he is a gav fog and everybody and wrote mean comments about him and @PERSON1 got bullied so much couldnt like it anywhere and locked and hung himself and his mom found the next morning dead hanging in his closet. So as you can see their are many reasons why advance in technology isnt a good thing because many things even now have a bad turnout."	1805	
1806	1	"Dear newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on if I think computers are good or bad. Well computers are becoming well known in society we can buy laptops, desktops, phones that can go on internet.t.v.s gaming systems. I do think that this could have an affect on kids not going ouside as much and not getting exercise and seeing nature, I do belive though technology is a big part of life as we get older all our jobs deal with using computers such as a banker, ultrasonagrapher, teacher. To be prepared for jobs in our upcoming futres students should be well known to a computer and know how to use it. They shoud be able to know how to do presentations with there computers type well without looking and set documents into folders. Although I think the kids should be using computers and have a computer class in school. It doesn't mean that they will always be on a computer. School has a big part of getting students to go outside, exercise. They are able to get that during gym and wehn weathers nicer they are able to go outside and do activities. The kids can also join school sports team and sports teams outside of school. Besides getting exercise they can also comunicate with people across the world this benifits from learning different people cultures. I comepletly think that technology will benefit people for life and it will have a positive outcome on them, I hope you can too."	1806	
1807	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I do agree that to many people spend there time on the computers. In my opinion first I think they do because less time enjoying nature. Secondly, not enough time exercising. Also, there not interacting with family and friends @CAPS1 writing to urge you that to many people spend time on the computers. I hope you will agree with what @CAPS1 saying as you read on. As you can see many people spend alot of time on the computer but less time enjoying nature. For instance, you can go around help the community, help the homeless you can also have a day to your self go get some fresh air and take a walk. If I was oyu this is what I would do. Secondly, they spend to much time on the computers because they are not interacting with they family and friends. For example, I like to spend time with my family and friends. We go out to eat, the mall, we even sometimes just play the games together to have fun. Just like they should want to en joy being with there family and friends, you will have an closer relationship by doin that instead of being on the computer all day. Lastly, they spend to much time on the computers because they have less time exercising. In contrast like now we have alot of over weight teens. They rather be on the computer instead of going to a gym and exercise. I always try to exercise at home or when I'm playing basketball I do alot of running. If you ask me I believe exercising is better for you the sittin on the computer all day. In conclusion, as you can see less time enjoying nature, interacting with family and friends, and less time exercising. Is better for you than being on the computer being lazy. I hope that you will understand the way I am feeling about this situation."	1807	
1808	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard about people's opinions on computers and I thought I should share my thoughts on what I think being a person who spends an hour on the computer a day, I completley understand what people say when they say computers can be a distractment @MONEY1 your life. But I do not agree with this. There ore some positive things about computers. Some people in the world can not find jobs. Some people in the world have amazing talents and they are not discovered it. This is where websites like youtube.com come into play. People who are musically talented sometimes set discovered in youtube, and then in a flash they are making @MONEY1 a year. If the world did not have computers, very talented singers would not be where they are today. You tube is not the only website that is changing. Facebook.com can help you re-connect with the people to lost touch with. I was reading a magazine one day and I read about a girl who lost touch with her biological brother and found him so facebook. Sometimes computers can bring people together, and that is definetly not a bad thing. Have you ever gotten sick @MONEY1 your life and wanted to go on a nice vacation? I bet @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 readers in this paper would say that in some days, they would not mind a great escape. Computers can help you research far away places so you know where you would be going computers can give up the information you need so you will know anything and everything about where you are headed. Some people @MONTH1 beleve that computers are not necessary because instead @MONEY1 being online, you could be excersising or doing anything else to improve your health. I think people should still have computer acess, but limit the amount @MONEY1 time they spend on it a day. If people did not spend all their time online, I am sure people would not feel on issue about computers. In conclusion, computers are actually pretty they can help you and jobs, re-connect with friends and family, and look up places you are wanting to go. But also, people should be living their lives. Limit yourself on the computer thats something we can do right?"	1808	
1809	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have an extremely bad effect on the people of society. Instead of getting stuck on the computer all day, we could start excersing and losing weight. We could also go to a soup kitchen and give out meals. Finally, we could save the environment from all of the electricity we use. It would benefit not only yourself, but others as well, if we did theese things.. To start, I would suggest that people stop spending so much time on the computer, and join a gym. I mean, who would want to be the one to be at home, bored, on the computer? You could be having so much more fun with your friends on the treadmill. @PERSON1 @CAPS2 from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, states, ""The key to losing weight, is to be motivated and have fun."" You can't do that on the computer. Eating right can also impact how much weight you lose. You could learn where to eat right by going to a soup kitchen. First of all, going to a soup kitchen would help many people who need food and nutrition. I remember a time when I was going to a soup kitchen with my church. I definately didnt want to go, but, I had to. Once I got there, I really started to enjoy it. Another reason you should go to a soup kitchen, is to meet new people. It would help you to get to know them and be friendly. The most important thing to hungry people to love. If you went to a soup kitchen, you could give them that and fresher air by riding on a bike. I firmly think that going on a bike would help the environment as well as if we all turned off our computers. Studies show we use about @NUM1 kilowatts of energy a week. I we shut off our computers for only one week, it would bring that number down to @NUM2 kilowatts. I feel that the environment is an important part of the world and that we need to take care of it. If we do, it will last a lot longer. By using the computer less, there will be less polution. We won't have to waste our world or be selfish for unimportant things. In conclusion we should go to a soup kitchen excersize and turn off the computers. They are a very bad influence on america. Computers have to much of a bad effect on society."	1809	
1810	1	"Although some people believe computers aren't very usefull, you'll see why they are benefits to the society. Friends and family can keep it touch. Computers are very helpful with school, work, and projects. They also help test harmful, dangerous or tricky experiments. I know tons of people who are only able to keep in touch with faraway friends or family by using computers. For example, my friend that lives here in @LOCATION1, keeps in touch with his grandmother and grandfather that lives in @LOCATION2, by using the video chat on his computer. This allows him not only to talk to his grandparents, but to see them as well! Computers also help friends to keep it touch with websites like, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. The websites aren't harmful, but helpful. Friends love to use the websites to keep in touch with friends and family. Computers are also very helpful with schools, work, etc. I always use my computer when I have a project in school that I need some help on. Everyone uses computers when they would like acurate data. Computers are easier to find information for a book, and information is posted everyday. Which just shows how computers are much more up to date then books are. I'm not just saying this. This can be proven. As well as, typing up a project and printing it out for school, work, etc., is a lot neater and with the ability to spell check, gramer check, etc, on computers. You will have less mistakes on a project when you use a computer. Now, for me last opinion on computers. How would harmful chemical testing be without computers? How could we be sure our cars are running fine, and are safe to be in without computers? There are so many things that we depend on a computer to tell us is safe. Computers also help us design cars, buildings, etc. For example, say engineers are try to make a new small compact car that is safe enough to protect the drives in a @NUM1 car crash. Are the engineers going to make tons of different cars, put people in them and crash into a wall going @NUM1? No! We have the to test it on computer. Clearly, we must rethink the way we look at computers. They were made to help us. I told you how they help friends and family keep in touch from long distances I also told you how they can help you with school, work, projects, chemical testing, car testing, etc. Computers are made to help us and they always will. I see nothing wrong with the creation of computers, everyone uses it. "	1810	
1811	1	"Computors are looked at as either friend or foe. I see computors and technoledges as friends not an enemy to battle against! Without the computor keeping in touch with people would be limited greatley. In schools computors help us learn different open our world so we are not just limited to places close by that people have told us about. They are truly magnificent! My best friend is moving to @LOCATION1 in two years. When she does I will have to keep in touch with her mainly by computor. Email is not only cheaper but quicker than mail. And like my friend, someone you know might live in a diferent time zone and making calls could be difficult. Computors don't only allow you to keep in touch with distant friends and reletives but also people close to you. Everyone has a scheduaule, they are a part of everyday life. Finding the time to talk to someone is difficult expesualy when their schedual never seems to match yours. You don't want to lose the freindship or cut your ties so what do you do? Email then when you can via the computor! You have time then and there and don't know when you'll have some again. That makes mailing somthing quite difficult. Life is basicly one giant schedual with empty slots for 'you' time. In this 'you' time there are many things you can do. For example, go online and look up interesting places to go around your area. After using some of your 'you' times for research you can take a day off and go somewhere as a reward for all your hard research. Things like this are very hard without the computor. You would only be able to go places you knew or heard of. Computors help you and different places with more information then you could get from one or two people. They do more than just look up places and information to make plans for just you, you could do a double team and go some place with two people who both information from their computors. Or have a whole look up information and plans for a group outing of family or your closest friends. Besides keeping in touch or making plans computors can teach you. How many times have you needed to know somthing and looked it up on the computor? You can find online dictionarys and translators for free! I've often used the computor to translate @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 to @CAPS1 for projects that we arn't expected to know words on. Working men and woman so online to go back to school while still working full time. My mom does that to set in working with preschoolers! My sister has used to the computor to look up information about colleges as she is going soon. Can't you see that computors arn't out to kill society? They are here to help you keep in touch with your greatly missed family and friends in far off places! To help you make plans for some rightly earned 'you' time, 'friend' time, and 'family' time! To give you a chance at a better job helping you learn! Can you see now how computors are here for help? Sure people missuse them but that can easily be prevented by parents keeping a close eye on their children and adults watching ther time closley."	1811	
1812	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to inform you, my opinion on the effect that computers has on people. I belive hthat computers has a benefial effect on people, because its up to date technology can help you learn things faster. Also, you can talk with people online all around the world, and even reconnect with old friends. Finally, computers allow you to find stuff out now faster, like sports stats and news storys. I dont know any other faster researcher ther a computer. Its like you can search for anything and find an answer for it. You can search for a recipe or baked ahska and you can actually get it in a matter of seconds. Instead of goin to the book store and buying a whole @NUM1 doller book on it. A computer is like having a book store in your living room. Also lets say your a college student studying for your mid-term, and you left your books at school, you can just go on the computer and search for what you need to study on. And bamm! There it is right in your eyes! Okay, so lets say your in school right, and your dad gets a job and you to have move far away. You don't have to worry about loseing your old friends, and contact with them. If you have a computer, you can chat with your friends anywhere. I mean like c'mon how cool is that! Your in @STATE1 chatting with your old friends back in new york! Thats pretty awesome. Also, lets say you where in high school and you and your high school sweet heart, where going strong and she away. Through the magic of the internet you can reconnect with that person and ones! Finally, your business man, and your jammed up at work with alot of meetings. You dont have time to go home and check the news. You can just go on your computer and check it from the office. You can watch the news and still have time for your @NUM2 o clock brunch, because you dident go home to see something you could in your office. Thats the beauty of it. Big sports fan, but stuck out at work and cant see the big game. But wait your bummed out for nothing because the game is at a click of a button if you watch it on your computer! You never have to miss the game again! In conclusion, i think the computer is a beniefial for people because, you can learn things way faster on it. Also because, you can chat and reconnect with old and new people. And last because, you can check the news and sports without having to leave the office!"	1812	
1814	1	"Dear news paper, Computers are good for people in many ways. They help us learn, just the way in school. They are helping us to learn more the just because some people don't like them doesnt mean shouldn't. After all, it is our lives. @CAPS1 do kids pay attention in school. But @CAPS1 we use the computer that's more we can learn. We can learn how to use the webcam to interact with our friends on the computer. We can do research to look up things that we do for school. Instead of learning something in school, and about it. We can read, and see a picture on video to understand it more. Computers teach us how to use more machines. We don't know what is going to be made? in the culture on how had they are going to be to use. So isn't it better if we know how to use them now? Some people don't even know how to use computer, or even cell phones. But @CAPS1 we get other cuture, that maybe a big problem. Just because some people spend all their time on the computers and don't do other things. doesn't mean we all do. I only go on the computer @CAPS1 I'm about to go to bed. But i'm out side, all day, I @CAPS2 do things with my family. So if some people have problems with computers, doesn't mean that we all do and to face the problems toward that so as I told you, computers, help us learn more thing in and even things for school. They teach us how to use things don't know gonna be in the just because some people are lazy doesnt mean we all are and have to deal with the people that do. So we should be able to use the computer without haging to deal people complaints. It is our lives."	1814

Ther re positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letteing people communicate with family or friends from across the world or letting everything be easy to find what they @CAPS4 many people are people isolate and keeping them from talking to family / friends I is helping them by being to chat or type to them. People can now talk to reltives in the comfort of thre home without having to about how they look. Computer also phone bills because of call your mom in @LOCATION1 just go on I chat and chat with her, it's just @CAPS5 you can see the computers Some people also think computers give people to much access to but ther it give people the of know what they This is good for school to for look for In my fall @NUM1. or people @CAPS6 you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that @CAPS7 computers without or keeping people away from family"	1815	
1816	1	"Dear Newspaper. I @CAPS2 that people are spending to much time on computer. They are hurting their eyes, gaining weight, and they aren't giveing the @CAPS1 what it needs. When you stare at a computer scren your eyes cant regenerate from the brightness & all the words & pictures. Your eyes shouldn't nbe punished like this they didn't hurt you, why do you want to hurt them? @CAPS5 always told that if I stare at something for a length of time @CAPS3 eyes wont readjust to their normal self because of straining themself for so long. I realy don't @CAPS2 all of you stareing at a computer want problems. Many people who just sit around are gaining weight, and you wonder why? Maybe its bevause your not out & moving around. When you eat you gain fat cells, callories, nutrients, and alot more. But when you gain those things from the food, your body needs to prove around to help break sitting still only tells the @CAPS1 do stop and hold everything there. To break all of the things down your body needs to be moving around I dont know about you people but I try @CAPS3 best to give thing it needs to maybe this will convince you! The @CAPS1 is the most important thing in your body. You need to make sure it's getting every thing it needs maybe you @CAPS2 you are healthy but your @CAPS1 needs fresh air and nutrients from the food. Sitting in a chair or laying down does not help anything at all. I used to do the same thing a while me that if I kept sitting I playin on the computer, @CAPS3 body wont be able to work or even worse. HEART @CAPS4 or seasons. Hopefully you will listen to @CAPS3 warning, maybe people will start choosing to leave the computer & go have fun and exercise. Reasons why being on the computer too much is bad for you are that your eyes have a really hard time working. Plus your gaining weight without even knowing and your @CAPS1 needs to be taken care of needs things that you cant get from the computer all the time. So please listen to what @CAPS5 saying. It realy if important that you take care of yourself."	1816	
1817	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have bad effects on people, and heres why: they get less exercise, become less social with family and friends, and it is dangerous in many ways. To start, people will most likely get less exercise if they go on the computer often. For example, if you sit in front of your computer monitor all day, chances are you are going to be less prone to wanting to exercise. Also, the outdoors might not compare to what fun you can have on the computer. And lastly, people can get addicted to games that have many levels: @CAPS1 is even a website called addictinggames.com! People might not even leave the computer to get let alone get exercise. As previously stated, computers can promote bad and exercise habits, which can lead to overall bad health. Next, people can become less social due to computers. For instance, you are probably going to end up in your house like a if you go on the computer frequently. And, chances are, you're not going to want to pay attention to your cell phone if someone is trying to text or call you. That can lead to very unsocial behavior. And last, the computer could become your life. Never leaving the monitor, never going outside, and never attending social events you don't want that to happen, do you? As recently said, computers can and will promote unsocial behavior. Finally, @CAPS1 is the dangerous side of computer use. Facebook, myspace & aim people can talk to you and friend request you, and you might say no, and might say yes, but strangers can always contact you either way. People @MONTH1 not know this but if you have a facebook account for long enough, people can look up your first and last name on google and see your profile picture. Its very scary! And to finish, a lot of people these days dont know how to be safe on the computer. They'll accept a friend request even if they dont know the person as previously stated, the computer has a very and dangerous side. To sum it all up, computers promote bad fitness, a bad social life, and it is very dangerous. You wouldnt want that for the people of our town, would you?"	1817	
1818	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I got to @ORGANIZATION1 at @CAPS5 society @ORGANIZATION1. Im at @NUM1 year old girl in the @NUM2 grade. Ive benn thinking a lot about how a lot of people who goes on the computer every single day with out doing anything interactive like playing outside with theri friends or having fun with theri families. Alot of people have probably been going on the computer so much that their addicted. ""@CAPS6"" taht is the sound of someone typing on a key board for a computer. Some people all around the world have been hooked going on computer so much that they are becoming lazy and they relly do anything to be active. Like playing a sport or even having a hobbie. I believe the most people who go on the computers the most are teens because they chatsites like @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. I go on such as @CAPS2 but I don't go on them all the time. I know going on the computer is too because you can go on it for homewroks or for projects to look something You can get pictures of someone or soemthing that your researching or type an essay. You can also you in contact with your family on online talking. Computers do teach hand-eye coordiantion because alot of students around the world have had the ability to learn about far away places before. I do believe that computer and negative effect. They say teens spends so much time But what if their homeworks and talking Their are alot of education websites for children do for . effecting on people. Like what in theri something . Some people can . So I think does benefits society if someone thinks not good that ."	1818	
1819	1	"Dear local newspaper, I understand that people are trying to deside whether or not being on computers is a good thing or a bad thing, and I think that this will help them make their decisions. I think that too much computer is a very bad thing because if people are sitting by their computer all day then they are not getting any exersize. And they are not enjoying nature out in the sun with their friends. One reason why too much computer is a bad thing is that people who sit on their computer all day can not get the exersize that they should be getting. Take my friend @PERSON3 for example, @PERSON3 never had a computer in his house before, he joined all of the clubs at school him and I were on the basketball team and we got a good amount of exersize every day. Now that his parents decided to buy him a computer, he quit all of his clubs and the basketball team, and now he is going obese. He is gaining many pounds every day. But @PERSON3 is not the only one with that problem. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 who are overweight are this fat because they sat by their computer all day. @PERSON1, physical tharapist has met with many obese people and talked about their problem she found out that almost all of them are obese because they do not get enough exersize because they are on the computer too much. Another reason why too much computer is bad is because they are not enjoying nature. Take my friend @PERSON2 for example, she was a great person who loved nature. But when she got her own laptop. She doesnt like to be outside anymore. I asked her if the counted to come to the nature with me and she said that she has a vertual park. on her computer. I tried to tell her that it was not as good as real nature but she said it was better. @PERSON2 isnt the only one with this problem. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 lack nature in their lines if they have a computer. Would you realy only want @CAPS1 to sit at home on their computers rather then enjoy nature? These reasons are why I think that people are getting way too much computer time, they are not getting enough exersise and they are not in the nature with friends enough."	1819	
1820	1	"People are or not computers benefit society. Some say that computers are an advancement on technology. I believe that computers are a most of time. People are spending more line on the computer than with family in members and friends. They are spending more time on the computer than exercising, and are not enjoying nature. Computers we just way people to become lazy. When computers out they because for more people to spend their family members and friends. Instead of playing a board games with their family kids and adults just go on the computer to play a game. Computers take away people can be spending with their friends. Now all people do is spend time talking to their friends online instead of playing outside. spending time with this people spend time with family members and friends because of . Researchers say that computers away from the time could be people on the . people the computer typing or playing . There now have jobs computer. Thus can people good . Enjoying a big of peoples lives along. Now you can just nature online rather than going outside and a pictures computers the ability to out pictures. People spend more time on the computer than outside. Nature to people . They would be on the computer. Computers are a big time. Any thing you finding computer you could find somewhere else. Computers away people. Spending time with and enjoying nature"	1820	
1821	1	"Dear Newspaper, I realize that you are going to make an article on using computers. I personally disagree with the statement that computers are good for you. People are spending too much time on their computers. Internet safty issues, the effecs of computer. My first reason is that people are spending way too much time on computers I know many friends that spend about half the day @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Satistics show that one out of every @NUM1 child in the @LOCATION1 is spending at least @NUM1 hours everyday on the computer. That's a lot of kids that show there time on the computer. They could be doing many other things during their time. They could be hanging out with frends at the mall or go to another friends because they could be doing fun activities with their parens and siblings. Also insted of sitting around and not doing anything the entire day the person could so ours and play sports like tennis, soccer and other fun athletic spends. If kids would exercise more in the @LOCATION2 we wouldn't have as many fur people as he. Another reason is the problem with internet safty. For example if you have an embarrasing of yourself from @CAPS3 grade and of your friends find it. He or she might post it on his or her facebook account. Then a school bully might see it and starts to tell other kids in your schoool about it through facebook. Those people might start your at school because of it. Another example is that you @MONTH1 have had a bad day in school an freinds, but then you friends stand insalty you. My final reuson is that using a computer for the work could change the you. If you use a computer for a certain amount of time for the right reasons that might be good for your grade, but if you are playing games and with the time of doing your homework or studying your grade with drop. That could effect your future. I think parents should monitor the actions children are taking online because you could prevent child for a grade class. If the parens have set a schedule where the  kidcould have a certan amount of time games or chat online their would be. I think that computers are not good for our society, People spend too much time on the computer. Instance of doing other things you never know what could be happen. Online games using a computer to play games too much might effect your grade. You should tell parent to computer use."	1821	
1822	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 how things work @CAPS1, I am writing a local letter I agree that technology @CAPS4 useful because without technology there @CAPS4 no way we can email or talk or text. Take a phone for an example A phone @CAPS4 good. It has technology and you can text. That @CAPS4 talking to @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @MONTH1 occur. The effects of technology @CAPS4 that technology @CAPS4 way more handson network and that means that technology, you can email faster than have to type up all the hard work and so when you can do it than everybody can do it too @CAPS3 a result i think that technology @CAPS4 a good thing. Therefore I have set my point. And I think that @CAPS4 all so you should have been good technology or technology shall come to you."	1822	
1823	1	"Dear ""The @CAPS1"" I agree with your theory that people spend to much time on the computer, true, you can learn vast knoledge about far away people and places. But if someone were to discover something magnificent, and think ""oh my, I have to create a web page describeing this wonderful place,"" they, at one point in time said ""I should write a book about this"" what I am getting at is that i do not believe that there is anything that is on the internet that we do not have documented in books, the internet can be used for bad purposes, like stalking people, and potential crimes, for example, @CAPS2, people take @CAPS3 quizes and are sometimes giving there password and private information away to strangers. People are also not spending enough time enjoying life if they are cooped up in there house, on the computer. I wanted to hang out with my friend once, he lives in a rural area, and he said it was to cold. It's @NUM1 and I live by the water, you know what he practically said? ""@CAPS4 thanks I wanna sit here and let my life waste away in front of a computer"" People can become so obsesive with electronics these days, the computer is another excuse not to call up your friend, and ask to meet for lunch or a cup of coffee, that is the purpose of computers, but in some cases a computer can be good, and used for good purposes, you can do things that we used to not be able to before computers. I was shown a doctoral website, to show you how to do a knee replacement surgery, and many other kinds of surgerys. They have online @CAPS5 and other animal disections, all these things that could not be accessable without computers, instead of having to drive to work each @CAPS1 and use gasoline, you can work straight from home! So it makes it possible to spend time with your family, set your hours so you can enjoy life, the way life is meant to be spent. But there must be balance, if you want to work at home, you shouldn't spend all your time at home, you need to go out, take a walk, walk your dog(s) or you can hang with a friend! If you live in a city go shopping! Don't spend your life, or most of it locked up in your house, online or not having fan. Those are my thoughts. The internet is used for bad things sometimes, computers can be very addictive, and they can be used for good in some cases, as you can see, or tell, I'm mutual about the internet, those are my opinions, I hope you enjoyed and got a lot out of long paper."	1823	
1824	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 all @CAPS3 have or more computer. They are used for communication, games and to type reports. But computers have more uses. They can be used to medical research, to improve are environment and to create means @ORGANIZATION1 transportation. Computers, I believe, would be hard to live without. They are used in almost everything. Computer are too valuable to our society; we connect rid @ORGANIZATION1 them. Work in the @ORGANIZATION1 has been impacted by computers significantly. When the computer was introduced robots were disigned to deliver redication to different rooms. There as computers advanced, robots could perform precise surgirirs. Computer also helped the medical industry when they started looking at @ORGANIZATION2. With computers, can see happened @CAPS6 a genetic mutation. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 recalls. ""The patient had a small bump on his arm. The computer the tissue taken from the . We had the tissue by hand and found nothing wrong. But the computer found a disease."" @CAPS4, people are saved by computers. COmputers are also useful when studying the weather. They have been key in studying global warming environmental scientist has. Computers can continuously record weather patterns and wind speeds. A human would sit next to an instrument a chart and log the reading. Because @ORGANIZATION1 human ever, the recordings would be off. So, the computer is more accurate. Computers in satelites can take pictures @ORGANIZATION1 ice cops. They automatically how fast the ice is melting, and @CAPS6 the speed @ORGANIZATION1 the melting is constant, it can when all @ORGANIZATION1 the ice will be gas. Without computers, environmental studies would be an science. Transportation is also enriched by computers. I remember when my class learned about. We heard bridge that collapsed due to post designing. When wind the blew, bridge could not support that live lead. With computers, bridge engineers can build bridges electronically. Then, they can use simulaters to put forces on the bridge, like traffic, wind and . Shamal @CAPS5 says, ""@CAPS6 this technology had been used to desing that , the would have saved @MONEY1, and @NUM1 lives."" Technology also made cars safer. Traction control and brakes are all controlled by the car's computer. The car can also sense what temperature the inisde is and adjusts to your . So you can have a comfortable ride. Computers are so useful. They are used @CAPS4 in transpotation, the medical field, and in global studies. Without the computer, our society will take a huge step backwards. "	1824	
1825	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 this as a front page n fad line: ""@CAPS4 suffers from brain damage due to computers!"" computers are a growing phenomenon in the world and each year newer, more advances models are being produced. This, however, doesn't benefit our society like you might think! Due to computers, poeple spend less time excersizing, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends, family, and other citizens. For these reasons, I believe that computers hurt, more than help, our community. To start, people spend far too much time on the computer. Weather it is shopping, playing games, watching movies or even working-it takes up valuable time that could be spent getting exersize! With the growth of computers, obisity issues have grown in the @LOCATION2 as well. Just this year, the @ORGANIZATION1 reported that about three in every five @CAPS5 are overweight. That is a groteque amount of people! on the sublect of @ORGANIZATION1, it has also been discovered that computers can cause eye and brain damage. @PERSON2 helmeg stated, ""@CAPS6, people are spending far too much time on the computers. With not as much exposure to the outdoors and other sources, people are causing long term damage to their eyes and certain regions of their brains."" @CAPS7, as a nation, need to get off the computer and go excersize! In addition to the lack of excersize in our nation due to computers, citizens are not spending as much time enjoying nature. People need fresh air in order to stay healthy! Not only does the outdoors provide fresh air though, but it is a source of beauty and knowledge. Grant @PERSON1, a local senior said. ""I remember my childhood as always being outside. I was never inside longer than absolutely necessary, unlike these days. I learned a lot from the outdoors and it has definatly helped me in life."" @PERSON1 presented a good point too. Having knowledge of the outdoors should be basic common knowledge to everybody in our society. Due to computers thought, the beauty, knowledge and importance of nature is being overlooked and not stressed as much in our country and community. Furthermore, computers create issues with the amount and kind of interaction humans get with one another. On computers, there are many online was to talk weather it is via email, instant message, or video chat, these forms of communication are destroying future generations. This is so because behind a computer, people feel safe. They feel that they can say or act in whatever manner they so choose. This not only leads to bullying, but it can affect the way children and adults interact in person. A recent study conducted by the @CAPS1 youth and family services organization showed that @PERCENT1 of kids are more comfortable communicating with peers on the computer rather than in person. That is a very large amount. If @CAPS7 don't change our use of computers soon, @LOCATION1's future generations could have a huge issue on their hands. All in all, computers have a negative effect on both individuals and our society as a whole. Computers cut into much needed excersize time, limit people's appreciation and exposure to nature, and interfere with social interaction. The next time you support computer use or find yourself logging hours infront of the screen, think of the negative results that occur! Finally, I vehemently improve you to stand up against the over-use of computers in our society and take a stand! Thank you for your consideration to my thoughts."	1825	
1826	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 position on weather or not computers are good or bad for you is that I agree that they are good for you in someways, for example they teach-hand eye coodination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people,and even allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 first explanation is that they teach-hand eye coordination. Computers are good for that because they can be used to teach up or even @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @NUM4 year olds how to count, spell, read, it can also teach you how to type, paint, and design on your computer. Next theres how they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Manily most adults use the computer to search for where they had grown up and what type of life they had, if it was a difficult or easy life. They also search for there private getaway or for a family vacation to @LOCATION1 or to @LOCATION2. However most people dis-agree with me bacause most parents are afraid that there teenagers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not put innapropriate pictures online or @MONTH1 even go on @CAPS3 for example and your child could be talking to a rapist or a sexual abuser that might be lying just to come to your front door and rape you and then kill you. Well to make sure that that never happens to lock inapporiate websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or any other inappropiate website. Last but not least computers also allow people to talk online with othe people. Most teenagers use there comptuer for this also they basically only use it for chat with their friends and/ or even use it to know whats been goin on lately. Most teenagers use @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 which are basically the samething, most parents dont allow their children to use those websites but there wrong with @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 because know rapist or sexual abuser can add you unless they know your screen which makes it impossible for them to add you. Also when you have @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 you can give your screen name to your friends which they can then add you. You can also block a person when you dont know them."	1826	
1827	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 up because what I have to say is extremlly important I am a firm believer that computers have negative effects on people. My first reason why I believe computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting the proper amount of exercise. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people are going to perminatly damge their eys. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. In case you @CAPS2't notice, I strongly believe computers have negitive effect on people. My first reason why compuers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting enough exercise. People are sitting at home on the computer for the day instead of getting their much needed exercise. Another thing is that the @LOCATION1 has a large amount of obice people living here, so the last thing they need is another exscuse for them not to get their exercise. Stats prove that since computers became increasingly popular, the number of obice people has risen @PERCENT1 from @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT3. As you can see, I believe computers are makeing people spend less time exercising. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it is doing perminant damge to their eys. I say this because people sit, on average, @NUM1 feet from their screen. Also, the amount of time spent looking at the screen from so close ranges from @NUM2 hours a day. Dr. @PERSON1, an eye doctor who graduated from @CAPS5, says, "" @CAPS6 this amount of time spent on the computer a day is malntained, then by the year @DATE1 their will be a signifigant increase in the amount of blind people. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because they're not spending enough time with their family and friends. I say this because rather than go spend time with your loved ones, people decide it is more important to constintlly check their facebook. For example, instead of going to a family picnic, you decide you have a fantasy football draft in a little while so you skip the picnic. Another thing is that sitting on the computer all day instead of interatcting with your love ones can cause you to loose contact with them and be left all alone. As you can see I strongly believe computer have a negative rather than a positive effect on people because; they cause you to loose exercise, damage your eyes, and they cause you to loose contact with your loved ones. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter."	1827	
1828	1	"Dear local newspaper, I agree that people do spend more time on computers than actually doing there studies or even excercising. Also people do spend to much time on computers than they normally spend interacting with there own family an friends. I personally think that people should actually spend more time with there own family an friends more than be on the computers on the time also maybe parents should only let students have a certain amount of time because if students get everything they want all they gona do is always be on the computer. Another reason why people should not use computers so much is because the computers could also be so warned out because people be on them to much. Also on a labtop if it get to hot it can catch on fire. Also if you use the computer so much at a time you can get viruses an then your computer will break i think people spend to much time on computer because maybe there family is not the perfect family there maybe be some problems in a family maybe thats all people wanna do is be on a computer. Maybe a computer is a person's best friend. But then again people could get blind from looking at the screens so much."	1828

1830	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly support advances in technology. Not only does a computer help teach hand-eye coordination, but helps others goin knowledge too. It even allows you to interact with others who live far away from you. Most people say sports help people learn hand-eye coordination. Not as many people know that typing does too. Maybe not the @NUM1 - finger crawl, but if people take the time to learn to type correctly, then their aim should improve greatly. This is only one great asset to a computer. If you live here in the @LOCATION2, you probaly don't know much about places like @LOCATION1. To find information on this ice-covered country most people hit the computer. Typing ""@LOCATION1"" on search engines like ""@CAPS1"" is much quicker than paging through dozens of books. You could find the same information with just one click. Sure computers help with hitting the next soft ball, or acing your next history paper. But, what about family or friends who have moved away? Computers can help with that to. Some people fear that kids, and even adults, are spending too much time on the computer. Not enough with family or friend. But, you can connect with them still. Wether it be with someone states away or someone who lives down the street, e-mail and instant messageing servers can help you contact them quickly. I think others should see how important computers can be to daily life. They help teach hand-eye coordination, are quick to find information you need and, help keep close relationship with people who aren't around."	1830	
1831	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 out @NUM2 household in @LOCATION1 own one or more computers. While computers help us look up information more efficiently, they also have negative impacts on ar lives. Computers badly affect humans because they worsen students' academic performance, can be dangerous,a nd make people less healthy. First of all, computers can damage students' education. While computers are helpful to search for information, they can also be abused. Not all websites are appropriate and if a child is supposed to be typing an essay or something, they can easily get distracted on th internet playing games. This can result in a student's grades lowering because they spent more time foolinf arand on the internet than searching for facts relating to a topic in school. Also, students will not learn how to search things the "old-fashioned" way, such as looking for a book in the library using the @ORGANIZATION2. Clearly, computers do more harm than good regarding students' education. Moreover computers can expose people to dangers... With all of the social networking sites nowadays, including @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and instant messaging, it is much easier to contact strangers. My friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4 once went into a chatroom on the computer and began to unknowingly talk to an internet predator. He found out her name and address and came to her house and tried to hurt her. All of this would not have happened if she hadn't entered that chatroom. Even people you know that @MONTH1 not like you can cyber stalk you. As you can see, @CAPS5 information about people is so much easier with computers and some people will abuse that advantage. Additionally, by using computers, people become less healthy. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 said that they are less physically active since they bought a computer. This is because with a computer, you do not need to leave your house to find information or be entertained. Instead of walking to the to the library to borrow a book or playing a sport for fun, all you have to do is @ORGANIZATION3 information about a topic or play games online. Furthermore, your eyesight will worsen by by starting at a bright computer screen for hars everyday. By having computers, people's social health also worsen. Instead of having to talk to people face-to-face, you can instant message people. With out a doubt, computers harm yar health physically and socially. In conclusion, computers do not benefit people because students' education is damaged, people can be put in dangerous situations, and yar health can decline. Computers pose as a distraction to students, internet predators can contact you, and you get less physical excersize. I hope you realize that computers do more harm than good."	1831	
1832	1	"Dear Newspaper, ""Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people."" Computers definitely have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, have easy access to information, and at the same time can have fun, and be social. Computer's most definitely should not be a huge concern. Computer's are a big part with helping with hand-eye coordination. If you are playing a game on a i-@CAPS1 and the goal is @NUM1 lap the bubbies that pop up, than the computer will have made it easier is, bubbies quicker. When you are actually on a computer, you can see and tap the keys on the keyboard quicker because of the better hand-eye coordination you have from computers. Another example is if you are in a rush to leave, as soon as you yhour car keys, grab them quicker. This is because of the hand-efe coordination that was improved from computers. This is not the only way computer back effect on people. Computers give easy access to information. For example, if you need to research information on another. Country for homework, than you can your question this a search engine. Also if you are wondering about the lyric can song, you can type in www.lyrics.com into the internet and they will give you the lyrics needed the . If you are in a debate with family about whether or not @CAPS2 is the capital of @LOCATION1, than you can type the question into a search engine. Computers do more than access information easily. With computers, you can also have fun and of social. A way to be social is cheating with an old friend from camp, or from school on www.facebook.com. If you want enteratinment than you can go on www.youtube.com and watch your new and favorite music videos such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 by @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 @CAPS6 @CAPS6 by @NUM2. If the weather is bad outside, you can always go on www.miniclip.com, to play games. Compters are used for many different reasons; more than just fun and being social. Computers do many things such as help with hand-eye coordination easy access to information, and run and social purposes. Computers have a very positive effect. The only issue is overdosing! the time spend on the computer. If you mange your time wisely so than you do other physical activities, than computers are fantastic!"	1832	
1833	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on society. In one little machine there is so much you can do. There are ways to communicate with others and even learn new ideas. The computer really is a benefit. One way the computer is a good invention is that it gives people a chance to do things they wouldn't normally experience. For example if a person wanted to see a picture of @LOCATION1, all they would have to do is type it into a search engine. Also, it makes many tasks simpler for people. Typing on @ORGANIZATION1 is much faster than writing out a letter. Plus, all the information you need is right at your fingertips. Not only is a way to learn. Like I mentioned before, the search engine is a useful computer tool. BY typing a key @ORGANIZATION1 onto the screen, lots of information is accessible. Why would anyone take the time to look through a book when it could take five seconds on the computer? Besides having an infinite amount of information, the computer can give an education. Many people today can't afford to attend a college. The computer makes it easier by giving them online courses so they can work during the day. This helps a hardworking person receive the education they deserve. Another way the computer is beneficial to our society is it makes communication easier. For instance, say a student got a detention and his teacher wanted his parents to know. Instead of mailing a letter which could take days, all the teacher would have to do is send an email. You might say, ""@CAPS2't the teacher call?"" @CAPS3 could but what if the student's parents aren't home? EMail is fast and can arrive at it's destination in under a minute. Another way people communicate on the computer is through sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Each person is able to set up their own profile and look for people they know. With this ability, one person can find people they had met twenty years ago. It's a great way to reconnect with old friends and talk with current ones. In one little box, people can do so much. Life is made easier through programs like email and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We are able to do things like go to college, from the privacy of our own homes and communicate and share pictures with old and new freinds. The computer is a machine that effects mankind in a good way."	1833	
1834	1	"Computers @MONTH1 be helpful at some times, but they are taking too much valuable time from peoples lives. When people are bored, instead of going outside or doing something productive, they decide to go on the computer. Everything that you do on the computer can be done off of it. Plus, computers @MONTH1 be part of why people are obese. Also, as much as you can talk to friends online it will help you be more social if you didn't talk over the internet. There is more to life that what is on computers. Computers are an easy shortcut to finding the things you desire. Looking for facts for your history project? Go to the library. People in the past didn't have computers, yet they were still smart. You can learn hand-eye cooordination by playing sports, too. Then, you would get your exercise along with it. Although I do agree that is easier to get in touch with people that live far away, you could still do that over the phone. Having trouble with your math homework? Instead of looking up how to do it, like I know I've done many times, go get help from your friend and make a study session. There are plenty of ways to do things that you thought you couldn't do without the computer. How many times have you been on the computer even when it was a beautiful day outside. The computer @MONTH1 be interesting is the world around you. Our obese people percent is becoming larger and larger. I think the computer @MONTH1 be contributing some to this percent. People don't go out for a walk or bike ride as much as they used to. Instead they stay inside and do things like going on the computer. People need exercise to stay healthy. You can't get the exercise you need if you are on the computer. The computer is limiting your social interaction with your peers. Of course on the computer you can talk to them. But, you should be hanging out with them in person. This would boost your social life and let you have fun and enjoy being with friends all at the same time. My friend once told me that sometimes she didn't want to hang out one day even when she had nothing to do. So, she went on the computer. I once read a story in which a girl loved watching tv and because of tv she forgot what she liked and didn't spend as much time doing the things she used to. This is the same as with a computer. People get sucked into them and don't do all the fun things they could be doing like spending time with friends or family. I think that although computers @MONTH1 be helpful sometimes you shouldn't make them a big part of your life. Try to do things without the help of a computer. Go out and get fit and in shape. And, spend less time on the computer and more time outside enjoying your life with friends and family. You can have a life without computers, so go and live it."	1834	
1835	1	"Yes, computers are benefits for society. One they help people such as finding stuff in the enternant. Two computers are etertaining. Last but not least you do whatever you want with it. My first reason was that they help people. I said that because they help people find stuff in the enternant. For example it's good for people to do their homework. Like a project or essay. You could comunicat with family of friends that are away from you like @CAPS1.R. or @LOCATION1. My second reason was that their entertaining. The reason I choose this reason was because computers are good for games and more. For example you sould find games such as racing games or sport games if your into tehm. It has different kinds of games. They also have cool websites. For example @CAPS2.com @CAPS3.com and all sorts of websites. My final is that you could do whatever you want with it. By that I mean that you could got to websites like @CAPS4 thatr you talk to people. Print pictures out for wotk or school work. Anything you want with it, its yours! So their you go you heard all my ideas from finding stuff in the enternet. Two their entetaining. Last but not least you could do whatever you want with it. So their you go, these are my ideas about computers hope you like them!"	1835

Exercise is the way to go you can see all of Nature and you can do many sports to get ative. Technolgy is bad with @CAPS4 you won't get exercise, but without @CAPS4 you can go out and see nature on vaction and hikes. You can go on far away vacations have fun and exersice like going to the beach and swimming or walking. Also if you go on hikes you will see the buety of nature and you get get exercise. A lot of people today don't go out much because of the computers and get fat so a hike will help them a lot. Computers has a down side because people get addicted to them all the time and get lazy and fat. Nature can get you some ware in life like you can love @CAPS4 and try to save @CAPS4 cause you love @CAPS4 so much. Another thing people could instead of playing with the computer is play a sport. There is a sport for everyone out there to do no matter what @CAPS4 is. Also you can be a dare devil and do crazy stunts like jump a canyon or something like that. A lot of people are that use computer and are still in shape so a lot of people that like computers can do that. Another thing is that people love to talk to each other and its not bad to go on a computer once in a while but all the time is very bad for you. Also the people that love there computers don't meet a lot of people at all unless they have friends. In the world today so many people play sports all the time wether its @CAPS5 or football you are still geting active. To sum @CAPS4 all up computers are bad because they don't give you exersice. Also going out to see nature or playing a sport @CAPS4 is exercise and @CAPS4 can help you."	1836	
1837	1	"Dear editor I belive that computars are an important and benifical part of our socitey. Computars can teach people hand eye coordination learn about far away places, and let people talk with other people around the world. This is why computars are a benifical part of our socitey. Computars can teach people hand eye coordination which is a very useful in the real world because lots of jobs you to use your hands. Most jobs that envole tecnolegy, its good to have hand eye coordination, but to have good hand eye coordination you'll need practice and some people might become obsessed with the computer and never come off while there practicing there coordination which might led them to forget about important things in life like these family but the easy way to fix that is by giving yourself a get time to be on the computer and that shoud never happen. This nis how hand eye coordination is good and how it won't let you lose track of important things in your life. Also computars can be a good learning expercience, they can teach you about far away places like the collisum in @LOCATION4 or the @LOCATION2's of @LOCATION1 and even the @LOCATION3 rain forest and the tribes that live there. Also the computar can help you book flights so you can go to these wonderful places, plus if you go to these places you'll get a serious workout because you'll be out exploring so you don't got fat and unhealthy from sitting at the computar all day lastly I want to say that the computar can teach you about far away and give you a lote of back on them too. this is another reason how the computer can benifit us. Lastly the computar ca allow to have a long distance conversation with people. talking with people, even one's around the world is good because everyone needs to talk to someone now and then, yet sometimes talking can get out hand which what I mean is you'll be on for so long that you'll forget what the outside of your room look's like and what nature is, like I said talking can be good but don't do it every day for the rest of your life because its good to go out for, enjoy nature, even garden this why the computar is good for communication not just because you can talk to you @CAPS1 penpal but so you can learn more about the cultures os the world. That is why the computar is a good and important part of our socity, it can teach us hand eye coordination, teach us about for away places, and even let us talk to people that are on the other part of the globe that why the computars is good even though it can com some our lives but there past that, that is why the computar is important to our society."	1837	
1838	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2; I am writing to you for the debate on wether computers help or break people down. I do think they break use down but they do help us in so many ways. On a computer most people will think about going on websites of games. There is more to it than that. Our technology is so advanced that people who use computers can talk via text chat online or a live webcam chat, they make it so we dont always have to drive somewhere and waste gas. The following paragraphs will show why computers are great to use. The way we take care of ourselves. If most people eat and eat constantly what good does that do for them? They need to know @CAPS4 they need to excercise and should do it daily. People do get addicted to computers but that doesnt meen they cant excercise. This @MONTH1 sound weird but @CAPS4 we type a lot of fact we build strength in our hand-eye cordination. The internet also could teach us new ways to exercise not just us running around. Our hands actually get stronger @CAPS4 we type due to the amount of times we use them constantly @CAPS3, @CAPS3 is an excercise. Secondly a computer can prepare kids for future carrers in offices, @CAPS4 we type we memorize where the keys are so soon enough we can not even look at the keyboard @CAPS4 we type. We can also use computer and take college classes and graduate through the internet for people who cant aford to go to a college university. The internet is a great resource for many things, one of the things is to learn another language so you can communicate with other people around the world. We can also learn how to do things due to website youtube. You can upload anything on the website and become viral over the internet and show off you own content. The internet has websites that can help you select future jobs, display you own stuff, or just view many things. Last but not least the internet has websites like facebook that will let you interact with your friends or family members who accept a request from so you never meet any strangers or can get harmed either way. Its a easier way to communicate father than driving to meet someone or hogging the house phone. The computers come with so many features that make everyone who uses a computer a lot easier to use. They now make touchsmart computers and wireless mouses. A computer is not just for us to have fun on. It teaches us subjects in depth. Its great to have a computer because you can learn about different subjects, you can interact with other people around the world, or you can prepare youreself. for a future job. Computers are not bad at all they do things for us that we could never think of computer are great to own."	1838	
1839	1	"I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because they help out a lot. They have many diffrent capabilities. Read on to find more on why I think that computers have a positive effect. My first reason is that people can communicate with friends they havent seen in a long time. This is a good thing because if you lost contact with a friend you could find him on the internet. Also you can keep touch with friends and family if they go to far places to see to see how they're doing. Lastly, you can keep in contact with pepole you havent seen in years. This is why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. My @CAPS1 reason is you can write stuff and type it into the computer. I think this is good because what if a person has messy handwritting and they have to write something for their job. They can just type it into the computer and and print it and it out neat. Also you can send letters to through the computer. This is another reason why I think that computer a positive effect on people. You should agree with me on this. My last reason uis that if you have a computer you can actually play games that can make you think faster and you can also by things of the internet instead of going to be store. Like if the store ran out of the thing you wanted you could buy it online and stil got it on time. Ang the gmaes @CAPS2 talking about are mind games and prizes that make think harder. Also you actually go to college through the computer. These are my final reasons that i think computers have apositive effect on people. I think you should agree with me and I hope you will computers have a positive effect on people. I dont really se a negative effect that comes out of them. Accept for when hackeers try to hack into your computer. so agree with me and my reason on how computers have a positive effect on people."	1839	
1840	1	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. For an example, if you need to know of search for something you can look it up. The computer most likely will have what you're looking for (@CAPS1 search engine is @ORGANIZATION1). You can keep in touch with a person no matter how far away. Also, being on the computer doesn't have to take time away from nature and family. First of all, there's so much knowledge on a computers. It has mostly every topic you can think of. This can benefit in various ways. For an example, if you want to know about a medical issue/problem, you can find it. People that are in school no matter what grade, it helps if you look up the subject to get numerous resources. Over all, probably one of the most common things to do on the computer is shopping. Instead of leaving your home, mostly every greatly known store has their own website. Sometimes, even minor stories have a website. Computers are great in knowledge and searching. Secondly, computers are great to communicate, @CAPS2 someone @MONTH1 live a very for distance from where you are, you can always keep in touch. There's chat rooms, webcam, email, networking sites, and more all over the web. Why keep adding to your phone bill, using your minutes, or hope for a signal when you could just use the simple computer? computers are a smart way to communicate. Lastly, computers aren't the ones who take time away from family, exercise, or enjoying nature. The amount of time used on the computer is up to you. It doesn't have to be an everyday thing using the computer nor does interacting with family. Exercising, and enjoying nature. You could always fit in time for both or you could just use the computer when you necessarily need to. Using the computer doesn't harm your time with family, exercise, and nature. In conclusion, in my strong opinion, I think a computer benefits society. Computers can be used for search engines for knowledge and shopping/bargaining. They're also great for communication. Lastly, computers never really take time from your family and friends, exercise, or nature. That's all up to you. Therefore, I see that computers really benefit society rather than waste it."	1840	
1841	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about the effects of computers on people is that computers have good effects on people. One reason is computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for home work. Another is that computers have good effects on people because if you want to chat or talk with a friend online you can if you have a computer. Lastly if you are going on vacation and you need directions to go to the place you want to got you. Just look them up. First, computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for homework. If you try finding something online like a definition for a word you will find it. If we did not have computers we would not be able to find things for homework that easy. We would have to look through a lot of books just to find it. Second, computers have good effects on people because if you wan't to chat or talk with your friend online you can if you have a computer. You can ask your friend what your homework was if you forgot. If you were absent from school on like a @DATE1 you can ask a friend online what you missed in class and what they did in school while you were gone. Finnaly, if you are going on vacation and you need directions to go to the place. Were you want to go to you can just look them up. If you look them up you will find directions really fast. It's better to look up directions because you will not get lost. If you don't look them up you will got lost. @CAPS1 opinion is that the effects of computers on people is good one reason @NUM1's that computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for home work. Another is that if you want to chat or talk with one of your friends online you can if you have a computer. Lastly, if you are going on vacation and you need directions to where you want to go you can just look them up. That's why I think computers have a good effect on people."	1841	
1842	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is quite obvious that computers are in fact a benefit for the society, and they are convenient when keeping in touch, but in my opinion, computers are beginning to have a negative effect on people. They are affecting people mentally, physically, and they're also having an impact on people's safety. People need to unplug the hard drive and start living life unplugged. We've all heard the term before, a 'couch potatoe!' @CAPS2 pretty much the same for a computer except a 'desk potatoe'. When people use the computer @CAPS1 has various negative physical effects on them. The more time people spend online, the less they can excersise, play outside and just enjoy nature. Computers keep people from going outside and excersising. The more computers we use, the bigger we're going to get. You're not gonna burn any calories sitting on the couch with your laptop. You can only get so much excersise from typing or moving a mouse. @CAPS1 also effects you physically when @CAPS1's pulling you away from your friends. Most @MONTH1 say you can still stay in touch with facebook, or myspace, but is that really friendship? You can't make any plans to do anything with your buds if all you're doing is sitting at the computer. Computers are having a negative effect on people's physical health. You know the term addicted right? @CAPS2 when there's one thing you cannot stop thinking about. That one thing that's always on your mind. This addiction is common when @CAPS1 comes to computers and technology. All day, all you can think about is getting a message on facebook or adding more tweets to your twitter. You are dependent on the website and technology. First thing you do when you get home is turn on your laptop. Computers are effecting people's imental health as well. They seem addictive. We've all been warned haven't we. Peop come to give speeches about @CAPS1, schoold constantly ramble abut @CAPS1 and that thing in internet awareness or sacety. Everyday, more than @NUM1 predators turn on their computers just searching for their next victims. This is a very serious negative effect that computers have on people. @CAPS1 seems so easy for one to fall in the trap of an internet predator. All @CAPS1 takes is one friend request, and they have a chance of you being their next victim. But predators are not the only things there's also virus. Virus all start with a ""@CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS1 is an ad or a saying you'll win a free ipod or something. And once you click on that @ORGANIZATION1, they're got you. Put in some personal information, they've got you even more. Virus and scams like that are major disadvantages to having a computer. So without internet awareness, your safety could be effected. Computers aren't having the best effect on people. @CAPS1 affects your physical and mental health, along with bad effects on your safety. @CAPS2 time for @CAPS5 to smash the hard drive and trash the laptops, then get outside and enjoy life, computer free."	1842	
1843	1	"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you want your children spending all day, everyday on the computer rather than spending time with you? I sure wouldn’t like that! Spending too much time on the computer can get you in trouble. It can also strain you eyes from staring at the screen. Also, you want get any exercise while on the internet. I'm writing this letter to convince you that spending all day on the computer does not benefit society. First of all, many kids in middle school and high school have myspaces or facebooks. If you spend all day on those websites you can get into a lot of trouble. Kids dont realize what they type can be available to anyone. They should be aware of what they're typing, but just to make sure, the parents should monitor them. Many people spend all day on the computer talking to friends and end up using inappropriate language. This can get them into a lot of trouble so they are better off spending time with family and friends. Do you the fact of having wear glasses fromstaring at a computer? Many people dislike glasses and if they stare at the computer screen, especially at night, they eventually will need them. Even switching from screen to screen and playing games hurts my eyes! If you staring at your computer screen. If it gets so bad, maybe glasses won't even help. Even though chatting with friends & family, playing games and watching videos on @CAPS2 is fun, you don't want to be a couch potatoe and gain weight. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens said that they knew a friend/family member who doesn't exercise at all and is always on the computer. If we prove that you won't be healthy after a week of computer, this ratio will go down by a lot. Enough of the @ORGANIZATION2's or videos about losing weight, just get off the computer and do fun activities outside! This @CAPS1 be great if we can stop people from gaining weight without surgery, medication, or videos, right?! I suggest you have an article on how computers can affect your weight and it's not good for you. In conclusion, I believe that looking/being on a computer all day will not hurt yourself, but hurt you family & friends. It'll help you stay out of trouble, be glassless, and be very energetic and healthy. Being on the computer and in a while is okay but not @NUM3. It's sort of like the cellphone now."	1843	
1844	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that computers have a great effect on people. One reason I think that is because if you are a loner, a computer can make you have friends. Second reason if you are bored you can go on a learning site on the computer. And the third reason computers will keep you upgraded. Computers have websites that you can meet people on like @CAPS3, facebook, and twitter. If you are a loner and really just need a friend the computer can get you that. Also if you start to talk to people on the computer you never know they could turn out to be that special someone in your life. Computers are a also great learning tool it has websites that can teach you math, social studies, @LOCATION1, and science. Also the computer is a tool its self if you know how to use a computer that can help you in the long-run if you need a job. I say that because now an days you need a computer for some jobs so if you know how to work a computer your good to go. Also if you want to be cool like your kids and not feel left out a computer is the way to go. Computers are so upgraded everyone either wants one or has one. And if you were always lefft out or for some reason felt that way @CAPS4 tellin you set a computer. Now I hope you read this carefully because computers will put a smile on any ones face. Always remember computers have websites you can meet people on also they have great learning sites and last but not least you will be upgraded. That is all I have to say for now."	1844	
1845	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you find out what's happening all over the world, or find answers to your urgent questions? The @ORGANIZATION1 can help you do this and more. With computers, people can quickly find the information they need, discover what's going on in the world, and connect to others. Computers have greatly benefited us. I can't tell you @CAPS1 many times I've used the computer to @ORGANIZATION1 for school. You can find out almost anything online. Are you concerned whether your headaches are serious? You can find out what your symptoms mean without having to leave the room. Do you need advice? There are people all over the world who can help you. You can also get information quickly. Just search what you want, click a link, and you're there. Computers allow people to easily get information. @CAPS1 would you know if there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1? You have to wait to watch the news, but on the @ORGANIZATION1, you can find out what happened in half an hour. According to @PERSON1, of the @ORGANIZATION1, major events such as a disaster or a celebrity's death, for example, are mostly posted online within an hour and a half. People can also learn about minor events that wouldn't be on the news, but are important to them. I was not able to attend the most recent @CAPS2 dancing championship, but I found out @CAPS1 my friends were doing by following a blog. The @ORGANIZATION1 keeps people in the know. The @ORGANIZATION1 is a great place to connect. You can see @CAPS1 your friends or family are doing with blogs, social networking sites, and more. You can meet new friends on forums, too. You don't have to call and hope your friend is at home. You can e-mail them all that you want to say. When my mom joined @CAPS3, she found her old highschool friends. They planned a reunion, and now they meet up all the time. With computers, we can keep up with old friends and meet new ones, too! Computers have changed our lives for the better. With them, we can get almost any information, know what's happening around the world, and stay in touch with family and friends. Don't you think they've made life a lot easier?"	1845	
1846	1	"Computers are a relitity new invention, a some-what complicated one with plus-rides and down-rides.. Some don't like the @CAPS2 because they think it's causing people to become lazy.

Computers can bread, get and bunch of other things @CAPS1 of course, someone has to fies it, and the builder can't fie everything. There are jobs for living computers and all of @CAPS2 - related things. With jobs bing on low battery, use need extra job. With computers, you can look up pretty much anything, @CAPS1 if you need help with your job, homework or even just looking up a phone number, you can use the @CAPS2 for. @CAPS1, as i've said computers are a great"	1846	
1847	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I am writing to you because I think computers are very helpful. They make it easier by providing more history, it has a lot more information than books do and when you need to get in touch with someone, its easier. With all these great ideas, you will see the perspective that I do. First, having computers helps when your researching history. About @PERCENT1 of the school say that when they are looking for history, there is more information on the computers. When we ask a teacher about history, they only know what they were taught. But on the computer, there are people all over the world that tell us what they learned. So, we get more information about history than what our teachers know. Secondly, computers are very helpful because they have more information than books do. I recall a time when I was doing a report on slavery, and when I was looking at information in a book, but there wasnt enough. So, I went on the internet and searched slavery and it gave me way more information then I needed. Computers are faster that flipping through the pages of a book. It would take two minutes to search it online, but if you had to look through a book, it could take hours. Being able to search for information online, would help get my work and your's done faster, by providing more information. Lastly, computers are very helpful because its easier to communicate with people. What if you didnt have a cellphone, how would you get in touch with a family member? You would go online and send them a email or talk to them on a chat. Having to get into touch with a friend or family member is very important to me, and @CAPS1 pretty sure you too. Computers make it easier to communicate with friends and family members. In conclusion, me and a lot of other people have a strong opinion about computers. They help us in many ways such as helping with researching history, has more information than books and makes it easier to communicate with people. Without a computer, life would be so complicated. I hope after you reading this, helps you to see how helpful they really are."	1847	
1848	1	"Dear @PERSON1 of the @CAPS1, I would like to say the computers do not benefit the society. Computers do not help people in the world today because computer take part in obesity. Kid dont want to time with family and @CAPS5 don’t work to do homework. First, computers now a days a big hit on obesity. I on the shows @CAPS5 exercize. @CAPS5 dont want to go out and exercize because they would rather be on instant messaging there friends. Who wants to go outside in the cold @CAPS2 you can have and go on the internet or I send that almost @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 citizens health has gone because of computer @CAPS2 children or @CAPS3 have computer they don't eat or sleep night. If they are on the computer people to eat and People also @CAPS4, computers take away tiime. Computers live families. Seeing that the children computer movies I tell her no I can always watch it on youtube. Finally, @CAPS5 are dropping and they arent @CAPS5 ont do their homework because they are busy on the computer @CAPS2 they come home they have to change there myspace of facebook @CAPS5 now a days have to talk to friends online then do homework. @CAPS2 I come home I go straight to the computer. I pick the computer instead of homework, because computers are easy to do. Homework is the most hardest and thing ever. Yesterday my eacher told me that I was failing then I was going on the and I yes so I might not graduate becaue of the computer. Well head of the @CAPS1 I hope that you take my opinion into consideration. Please remember this can be a good help @CAPS2 your @CAPS5 grow up."	1848	
1849	1	"I think that computers have the good effects on people. With a computer, you can have social interactions with people far away, if not even a friendship. Through the internet you can find people intrested in the same kind of things that you are. You can learn about different cultures and tell about yours. For example @PERSON1 likes to play guitar, but where he lives, there's no other people intrested in the same thing. From the internet he can a large guitar community, where he can share advices and tips with other people. He has also plenty of new friends, that he found from the netsite. Also what @PERSON1 hasn't noticed is, that his typing has gotten better. Typing is a very important in your life, if you are thinking business education or you dream about being, for example, a @CAPS1. You get better in controlling your extremeties like, for example, @PERSON1's playing has gotten better. Computer is a good way to learm new things and search an information. When I had health in my school, the theacher was suprised. ""@CAPS2 do you know so many things"", she asked, I haven't thought about the answer before. So @CAPS2 did I know all these things? From the internet of course, I realized. When you surf in the internet or you search something else, you bump in to another information. Also from internet site communities you learn from other people's experiences. When you use computer you have there many useful programs like for ex the @ORGANIZATION1. My friend, for example, loves to write and is dreaming about the job of a @CAPS1 or an author. She writes a lot on her leisure time but she doesn't have to buy a writing machine besides in addition to paper, ink and dictionary. This develops her writing skills and ability to write as she loves to do. So using computers helps people learn and it develops their social skills and emotional health. It stimulate you to do what you love (like playing guitar for example) And that's why I support using computers and believe that computers have good effects on people. "	1849	
1850	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a neccesity to this world. Without computers people wouldn't be able to catch up on news or maybe sports games they missed. Computers are also needed to interact with friends or family that you haven't seen for a while. The last reason why computers are needed is because they help with hand eye corrodination. These days news is a major priority to everyone. Without computers people wouldn't know that @LOCATION1 just got hit by a major earthquake and more than @MONEY1@NUM1 people died. Computers help with keeping people updated. With donations from the computer people have already donated @MONEY1 to @LOCATION1. A few days ago @ORGANIZATION2 killed one of this trainers and there is a major conterversy on whether or not he meant it or it was an accident. I knew all that information from ore website on a computer. Without these machines nobody will know what is going on daily in the world. Computers also include many features like facebook, @CAPS1, e-mail, myspace and more. All of these things help you stay connected with friends and family. So, maybe if you forgot who's house you're celebrating the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 at you can just go to your computer and check! Every once a while you feel like you're missing something for an event, well the great thing is that you can go on your computer and ask a friend. The last reason why computers aren't a bad thing is they help with hand eye corrdination. Whenever you're @CAPS4 up a paper you try not to look days at yourself @CAPS4 so then you can follow along with yourself: This really helps with hand eye corrdination. The @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS4 a paper helps with you're hand eye corridination @PERCENT1 more than throwing a football."" You can also play games on a computer which also helps with hand eye corridination. In conclusion, having computers helps this world more than it hurst it. You can look up news, you can connect with family and friends, and they help with handeye corrdination computers are a major priority to have in this world."	1850	
1851	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Some people @MONTH1 be concerned with all of the time being spent on the computer, but I think they have a good effect on us. People can do @CAPS7 things on the computer like research @CAPS1 projects, and get to learn new things, you can interact with people from all over the world, and some people that have sickness causing them not to speak have certain programs on computers to help communicate with others. So, don't you think computers are a good advance on technology? First, people can research projects, and get to learn @CAPS7 things, @CAPS1 example, if you get a history project and have to research a president, you can just type in the name and tons of information will pop up. Morgan from @NUM1 grade says, ""I do all my school projects on the internet. It is a very good source and sometimes I look things up just @CAPS1 fun, and learn something new everyda."" @CAPS2, computers might not have the answer to a question you need @CAPS1 a project, but statistics say it will have about @PERCENT1 of the other information you @MONTH1 need. Isn't it great that we have computers? Second, you can interact with different people from all over the world. There are @CAPS7 sources you can do that through like @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, and even @ORGANIZATION2. Say you go on a vacation like a cruise, and you meet some people that you became friends with. You can stay in touch with them through the internet. @PERSON1 from @NUM2 grade says, ""I went on a cruise @DATE1, and I made @CAPS7 friends. But, there are @DATE1 girls that I still keep in touch with through @CAPS4. I talk to them usually when I get home from school."" Computers are a great thing to have so you can keep in touch with others. Lastly, people that have sickness that cause them to not speak have computers to communicate with their family. Three @DATE1 @DATE1, my neighbor had a severe stroke that kept him paralyzed, and only allows him to move his eyes up, down, and side to side. A doctor told them their is a program called @CAPS6, which has the patient line his eyes up on a certain phrase, and the computer will speak @CAPS1 him. He can also spell things out, and you can have some communication. It is a great thing to have, so the family can have a way of speaking to him. It's amazing to have advanced technology @CAPS1 these reasons, don't you think? As you can see, I think that computers have a great affect on people. Some reasons I think this are you can do research @CAPS1 projects, and learn new things, you can interact with different people from all over the world, and people that have sicknesses who can't speak have programs on the computer that helps than communicate, @CAPS7 people could disagree with me, but I think computers are great to have."	1851	
1852	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the computers have an effect on those people, they should excrise nad look or explore nature, but my opinion for some people would be go on the computer for an hour or just limit the time, yes I know its fun but you still have to stay fit, smart and healthy. Being on the computer is not good for your brain. We should limit computer time for adults and kids. The effects that the kid have are possible. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in their brains are not as develope as adults. So yes it would be hard to get them off but show them how fun it can be off the computer. You should be getting fit moms and @CAPS4. Also take a rest and eat a healthy snack or at on that new tredmill you bought last @DATE1. Another reason why you should with the time cause who has to pay the bill cause I know that every time when the mail coms the bill come also and nobody like to pay bills. Mom and @CAPS4 I definitly think you should limit the kids computer time because there are inapropreate stuff that they might be looking at and all those websites that they are on they could be talking a chating to anybody thats very dangerous so give your kids the heads up. Show them how pretty flowers look in the @DATE2 or how bugs store food or just take the to the zoo and show the new bears hibernate. There fore the parents I know how you need to look up stuff an the computer but that great but the computer is not always right so just pop open a book once in a while its great you know so parent and was limit your time and do something like water rafting with the whol family. Have some fun and get shoe eyes off the screen and the fingers of the keyboard and go have fun."	1852	
1853	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I agree with computer experts that computers poison the brain. These are some reasons why computers ""poison"" the brain: Computers can blood shot your eyes, and make your vision blurry. People are on the computer all the time they don't get a chance to exercise. The more time your on the computer, less time you spend with your family and friends. One way, that computers are bad for you because, your eyes get all blood shot when your on the computer for so long. Your vision gets all blurry and messed up, after you leave the room you bump into things and get hurt. Staying on the computer to pull off all nighter is bad for your eyes as well because when your mom, dad, brother or sister opens the blinds the sun light would blind you. Another reason why computers are bad for you because, people are on the computer all the time they don't have time to exercise. People who are on the computer @NUM1 hrs a day aren't going outside enough get fresh air, play sports, etc. instead of playing computer games. Computer games are fun once in a while, but go outside and run around for once. A final reason why computers are bad for you because your spending less time with your friends and family. Instead of @CAPS1 your friends, go talk to them in person for once. Watch a movie with your parents, hang out with your brother, go shopping with your sister. Do something instead of being on the computer all day. All in all these are the reasons that are ""poisoning"" or ""rotting"" the brain of human society."	1853	
1854	1	"The question everyones asking is, should we spend less time on the computer. I think we should spend less time because excersise, talk to people in person, and learn new things, and I will explain why. When your on the computer you lose time to excersise. Without excersise you will be out of shape and wont be able to play any sports. At one point you will be skinny but if you dont do nothing and eat all day, you will become fat. Excersise helps you get your nutrition up more. You should excersise with friends so you dont have to be bored by yourself. At the end of the day when ur done then you can go one the computer. Several websites you can talk to friends. For example: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 and others more. But talk to them through @CAPS3 when you can talk to them in person. When ur bored at home call a friend and hang out and play some sports. Also if you have a special somebody in your life you would want to spend time with he/she. Why meet new people online when you meet them face to face. You could get to know them better and later you could have a trust worthy friend. When you need to use the internet is when you have homework. Why just look it up on google and read a book about it. Sometimes the things on the internet is false information. In math read what you have to do instead of using the @CAPS4 and finding the answers. People cant alway rely on the computer, sometimes you just need to learn it on you own. In games people want to use cheats and it's just not fun if you dont play fairly. I strongly recommend that for now everyone who has a way to get on a computer, should spend less time and have fun with nature."	1854	
1855	1	"Dear readers of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people have been makeing a big fuss about computers. Some people think that computers are bad and we should get rid of all of them. Me I completely disagree with them. I feel computers are a new and amazing technology. They help out so much in dayly life. For example say you ar doing a report for work you can go online and use resources to find more information about the topic of the report. Say you also have bad handwriting what will you do? You would go to a computer an type your report. I agree with some people that some people spend too much time on the computer. But there are more positive things about the computer than they are negitive, for example a positive is going on google and looking up information and learning newthings. A negitive would be people spending too much time on computers. All that im trying to say is that computers are wonderful things and that it is such a privlige to have computers. I think its great we have computers in our world."	1855	
1856	1	"My opinion for computers are that I do support the computers. Here are the reasons why, they are eduational for us kids. They are faster than books and they have a lot more information. And the last reason is because it has more opportunities for a lot more things. Let me explain more. The reason why I say that it is more educational is because of these reasons, they have very good websites for us to learn more, like funschool.com. That website helps you with every subject that you need help on. Another reason why I say it is education is because it helps you do essays or reports and if you need more information on what to do you can go on different websites and get exacly what you need. Like one day we had a @CAPS1.@CAPS1 project on @LOCATION1. Nobady new what @LOCATION1 was like. So kids went on diffrent websites and fond a lot of information for the project. The secon reason was faster, and the reason why I say that is because you can communicate with other people in different places faster. For example my cousin @CAPS2 is living in spane. And he also does not have a cellphone or a house phone. So when he can he goes on his yahoo and if my mom and I are on we able to talk to him. Another reason is because you are able search more things. Like if you have missed a talent show of yor family you are able to see it on the internet. The last reason was because"	1856	
1857	1	"Dear newspaper editor, Computers are used all around the world daily. The computer is the main thing in our society. One reason why I think so is that computers have a lot of knowledge. One other reason is you can chat with family and friends. My last reason is they help people learn. In these paragraphs, you will see why I think so. My first reason is computers have a lot of knowledge. On computers, you can search any question and get your answer. For example, say you put, ""@CAPS1 to make muffins,"" the computer will say @CAPS1 to make them. They know almost every answer. That is my first reason why computers are the main thing in society. My second reason why computers is the main thing in society is you can chat with family and friends. My one can chat on a computer. I chat with all my friends on the computer. It is really easy to do. That is my second reason why computers are the main thing in society. My last reason why computers are the main thing in society is they help people learn. People are able to go to school on computer. Have a college degree on computers. Even people work on computers that is my last reason why computers are the main thing in the society. Now you can see @CAPS1 computers are the main thing in society. Hope you agree."	1857	
1858	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @LOCATION1- @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am an @NUM1 grade student at @ORGANIZATION1. I think that @CAPS5 should have computers because people can learn a lot of far away things. People have a lot of fun times playing games writting and even chatting online. Everyone loves to have computers, so lets not take it away. IPI - @CAPS2 far away new things is really great of people something it us books, why not check the internet. Internet is faster way to search things. They should have time to be in the computer, doing there homework and having a lot of fun. Computers are expensive and not easy to get, but its sure easy to search for things looking for. Computers effect people a lot but its okay let us have free time. @NUM2 @CAPS3, chatting online over the internet that sounds cool. That effects people a lot because that is taking away time to do and taking bad chances when online. I don't want to have computers it keep going with that. For during homework its all right because you can type and of writing it in a piece of paper that would take forever. Computers but it sometimes. It affects people inn some ways. @NUM3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 take away computer people think that people hate that and would not be on work. They will be with out people don't want to be searching threw books all the time, it gets trying. Please don't late affects us a alot. Conclusion - @CAPS5 do believe that computers affect other. Please local newspaper @CAPS5 are telling you the truth."	1858	
1859	1	"Dear local newspaper, I agreed that computers have a positive effect on people. In this paragraph your going to learn about @CAPS1 computers are a positive effect, @CAPS1 does @CAPS5 help people, and @CAPS5 even allows people to talk online with other people. Do you want to know @CAPS1 computers are a positive effect? First, @CAPS2 way computers are a positive effects is @CAPS5 gives you more knowledge. For example, stuff you didn't know before you know now because you looked @CAPS5 up on the @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 way computers are a positive effect is you can keep in touch with your family @CAPS6 your on a vacation or at a job. On the other hand many people without computers cant keep in touch with their family then, @CAPS3 way computers are a positive effect is because @CAPS5 helps many people with their jobs. For example, cops use computers to look at peoples files and their past criminal record. Last, @ORGANIZATION1's help you learn different type of launguages. Have you ever thought about @CAPS1 computers help people? First, @CAPS2 way @CAPS5 helps people is @CAPS5 organizes stuff for them. For example, none of your work will get lost and you know where you saved @CAPS5. Second, @CAPS5 also helps learn about new places and history. For example, @CAPS6 your trying to learn about china's history you can do that un the @ORGANIZATION1. Next, @CAPS3 wat @CAPS5 helps people is @CAPS5 has the ability to order stuff online from far away places. Finally, computers also help people by introducing new and fun things to them. For example, their is many games online that make the @ORGANIZATION1 also fun and not boring. Many people agree that talking online over the @ORGANIZATION1 is fun. First, @CAPS2 way @CAPS5's fun is because you meet new people you havent known before. Second, @CAPS3 way talking online with other people is fun because you get to learn more stuff about that person and his/her cultur. Next, @CAPS6 also gives a chance for the people that dont have friends make some over the internet. Last, @CAPS5 also helps you talk to your family that lives in @LOCATION1 or even further. Have you ever thought of a @ORGANIZATION1 having positive effects? @CAPS6 you did, why dont you mension some stuff in your essay like I did for example, @CAPS1 computers are positive effects, @CAPS1 @CAPS5 helps people, and @CAPS5 even allows people to talk online with other people."	1859	
1860	1	"Dear people of @CAPS1, Have you ever thought about how many people in @CAPS2 are fat or obaes? Of how many hours they spend playing on the computer instead of exerciseing? What some people don't mind this lifestyle of no exercis, not seeing nature, and no friends or family to keep company with, I do not agree with this lifestyle. Imagin a hom of a bird, the dew on the grass, or the sound of the trees getting blown. Don't you just love the relaxing sounds and sights of nature? People who play on the computer say: this is the only world I kneed, and don't take the time to smell the roses. I took a survay and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said they would rather stay in and play video games instead of watch the clouds or do something outside. Now imagin this you have not seen light in over a week, what happens when you need to go out... you'll get blinded by the sun. Also not only is nature a great place to relax but @CAPS4 you don't go out in the sun a lot it could have servire conquense on your body, like your skin turns pale, your imune situm weakends, and you gain weight fast. Now think about this do you want your kids or do you want to look like some fat, pale person who is sick all the time? Imagin this you sit at the computer all day and all you eat is fast food, and you get up to walk around or do any kind of exercise. Does that sound fun to you? Some people who play on the computer waste almost @PERCENT1 of there day playing a game on the computer. I asked a person who usto send that kind of time on the computer he said |""I to spend so much time on the computer I forgot all about what my body needed. When i tried to get up one day and could not, that's when it hit. I need to do more for my body, I needed to take better care of it."" @CAPS3 now gotton back to his feet and fells way netter than he ever has. he thinks that spending almost @PERCENT1 of your day on the computer is a waste of time for all who do it or are thinking of doing it. Imagin you stuck in a box with no friends only a computer as your company. What would you do? Most gamers do this and end up lossing very dear friends or family members to this. I asked ex-gamer @PERSON1 about this, all @PERSON1 said was ""I think that it wastes perious time with your family. I almost missed my daughter frist steps because of this adtion. I also almost lost all of my best friends."" @CAPS4 you enjoy the smell and sight of nature, you care about your body, and you dont want to lose perious family time or friends. Then I sugest you vote yes to putting a band on compers."	1860	
1861	1	"Dear @PERSON1, I think that the advancing of computers and technology are a good thing. I think so because computers teach good hand-eye coordination, are a good source for research and lets you comunicate with people no matter how far away. So lets a take a good look at how computers give us a hand. I think computers are very helpful in life. I think this because they teach good hand-eye coordination.""@CAPS1 who have hand-eye coordination have a better chance at doing well in sports which is a great way to stay fit,"" says @PERSON3 of @CAPS2 view @CAPS3. High. I agree with @ORGANIZATION1's statement because how would you be able to play baseball without hand-eye coordination. For example, my friend chose uses the computer alot and is the star of the basball team.This is because you need good hand-eye coordination to be able to swing the bat while your watching the hall come at you. next i would like to help you learn about why the computer is so helpful. Say you one doing a project and you need some information you just can't find in the books. Where do you turn? The computer. ""@CAPS4 it comes to research the internet is the way to go"" says @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION2,"" @CAPS5 whore my most successful graduates found most of their research. More than @PERCENT1 of students use internet research daily. Would you want you children to be well educated with updated technology? Now I would like to talk to you about why I think the computer is important. My final reason I think computers are very useful is because it is a great way to comunicate with computers it is a easy to talk to people all over the world with no charge. For example @CAPS4 my mom wants to talk to my grand parents in @LOCATION1 she just uses the computer instead of running up the phone bill @PERCENT2 of americans use the ineternet as a form of communication. SO finally I think that the advancing of computers would be good since we rely on them so much. Since they are so important to improve hand-eye coordination, help with research, and comunicate would you want then outdated?"	1861	
1862	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I absolutly agree that people are spending way to much time on the computer, and spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family of friends. It just would be better for everyone to get out of the house, instead of sitting in front of the computer all day. People need to enjoy life. If everyone was just sitting in front of the computer all day, they will never enjoy life around us. People need to just walk outside and see nature. If they can't do that, they could exercise. Whenever I need to calm down, or even when I get mad at my parents, I go upstairs to my room and do some yoga. It relaxes me, we all should do this, too. A perfect example is when I was watching @PERSON1. I didn't want to put my mom made me. There was this women and she was so adicted to the computer. She has a part time job and barely feeds her kids. She would give her kids microwave meals for dinner, because she was on the computer every second of the day. When she was done with her job, she would go on facebook till one in the @TIME1. Then she would go to bed then set her alarm, so she can go on the computer again at @TIME1. So she barely feeds her kids, wakes up early every @TIME1 just to go on the computer. So once people get adicted with the computer, you can barely do anything about it. We need to enjoy life. Nature, friends, family. All part of life. Enjoy it while we can. About @NUM1 people probably don't go on the computer. Some effects we have on the computer for some people is they can get addicted, the computers there only friend, or even not liking outdoors. But the computer is not your only friend. You can have plenty more friends. If you go on facebook, and you have @NUM2 friends, you have someone to talk to. Don't just sit there in front of the screen and @CAPS3 them or email them. You should have a face to face conversation with that person. Your actually out, instead of in your house all day. It would be nice just to get some fresh air @NUM3 people, out of @NUM4, enjoy going outdoors. For example, my best friend asked me if I can go to the movies and then sleep over her house. But I said no because I was to busy playing on my computer. She was upset. And so was I. I didn't realize what I said to her. But I called her back up and apoligized. No one should be to busy to play the computer, instead of hanging out with friends. We all need to enjoy life, and hang out with friends and family. We allowed to enjoy life while we can."	1862	
1863	1	"Imagine you are on the computer at work but then all of the sudden your computer screen goes blank it has crashed, and you've lost all of the information that is vital for your to know and remember. A computer breaking could happen to anyone but the large problem is, most people don't know how to fix it. All of your information is gone and you are stuck without a way access all of the data you need for work, or you can't find important news online. This could happen with your children's computers too and they could loose necessary assignments for school. Computers are needed by everyone, and they have so many positive affects on people we can not afford to loose them. Most of us don't think about it that often but we store so much of our lives on the on a computer, if your computer broke, you would be loosing, more than just the internet, you would be loosing photographs you wanted, important word documents, or you loose information on important events you have learned, you don't wont to forget someone's birthday now you? My sisters computer broke two weeks ago and she lost a she had to turn in for colledge. She had to find the paper she wrote, and she needed to retype the entire paper on some else's computers do you wont all of that added simply because your computer brake? Not everyone lives are and we all need computers, it is much easier looking up the important news on the computer on @CAPS1.com rather than finding the news on @CAPS2. Everyone needs to know the news because it is important to be aware of the world around you. Especially if it's about your and the and the news affects you. Computers help us find the news we need to know quicker and easier. At @PERCENT1 of the people in my family have their own computer. It is necessary for us kids to have them too. These been many times where I've been sick and all I had to do was go on the schools website and find the assignments I missed. So I can be prepared for school the next day. Three out of five of my teachersuse computers in the classroom to teach the students in various ways that are more fun than just reading from a text book. The other teachers that don't have us using computers on a regular basis have used them though and that shows just how uuseful computers can be. Everyone uses computers. Everyone needs computers they are too important to loose and up have come to depend on them for work, awareness of the world around us and school. A life with no computers would be like."	1863	
1864	1	"Local Newspaper, @CAPS1. you! The one reading this paper! I think that it's okay that people spend so much time on the computer. I am one those people who spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. I have @NUM2 reason for this type of amount. My first reason is communication. My second reason is educational benefits. And my last and third reason is the occupation. I hope you will pay close attention these three reasons. You never know who can change your mind. Like I said before, my first reason for thinking daily computer use is okay is because of the communication. It is stated that @PERCENT1 of chiildren, and/or teenagers, have installed a computer communication system. The very popular sites, are such as, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1!. MSN, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. These are the easiest ways of computer communication. My second reason I think using a computer on a daily basis is the learning They make computer games from ages @NUM2-7. These games are @PERCENT2 educational. Game include childrens favorite as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. These games of ten in subjects of math, science, history, typing games, and sometimes different languages. My third reason for thinking staying on a computer for a daily basis is okay is because of the occupation. Computers keep me occupied all day on video games, music, and videos. It is said that playing computer games keeps your brain well stimulated. Are you still there? Once again my @NUM2 reasons for thinking being on the computer for a daily basis is, the communication secondly, educational privlages. Third reason, the occupatied is a big one. Well, I have to go now, please take these reason under consideration."	1864	
1865	1	"Dear @LOCATION2 newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION1 and I think computers very much benifet are life and that lots' of positive things can com from them. We can learn and get smarter, we can @CAPS3 act with new people and it is just a really great life still lots of good can come from computers. First, one reason computers can be a healthy thing is we can learn and get smarter from them. One the @CAPS2 there is all different sites that have information for anything that your mind can think of. This could help if you need to research for a project or just want to know a fact. Sure you could say that any one could put anything on the @CAPS2 but what are the chances of all the information and facts to be wrong? I think vary slim. Another way we could learn and get smarter is from all the @CAPS3 active games that many children play. You could play a math game, a reading game any game you want and all of these @MONTH1 make you smarter. I think there are many ways to learn from computers and grow. Second, another way computers can be a life learning thing is you @NUM1 to interact with all different people. You could meet anyone you would like. If you wanted to meet with your friends or family to catch up you could or if you just want to talk you could to you could even see them through the computer. This would reconnect you to old friends or to help up with your family. You could also meet people from other countrys. This would show you how other people live or how or what there culture is like. I think I would be very interesting to see new people and sights. last you could even just find a friend to talk to and you would be a much more stranger person because you have more friends and you would learn more. Last, computers just give everyone more life skills. One you get to learn how to type. Which could improve your hand eye coordination. Also this will help everyone in school type and write papers for a class. Another skill this will give you is you will learn how to research and find information. This will deffenetly be a life still because you always going to need to know how to gather information. Also, if you didnt know how to do this you wouldnt be able to find out where to go for car routes or what restaurants are good or anything. I think mostly computers are a great invention and addition to our life. In conclusion, computers are great. From the rest of our lives technology will keep changing and never stop so sooner or later we will have to learn somethings about computer. Computers are a big help in my life, are they in yours?"	1865	
1866	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I disagree and agree in the same time. If you want to know why read on. I disagree because in the winter some people don't like to go any where because of the snow. What are going to do? of course they are going to be in their computer like know and days it snow's and yes some but are going. All so people like talking family because know we have webcams and its fun seeing your face and especially your family for example I talk to my family in webcam because they live @LOCATION1 and I live in @ORGANIZATION1. I know some people would like to see there family. Where other people some time people don't go outside and what are you. You nothing but sitting there. Then I agree. I agree because I know we should go outside and play because it is good for us. Also I think when we are in the computer it gets boring. We should also be with are family then bring in the computer. go out with are family and go places because we are not going to do any thing better than in the computer. Go out and eat with family. Theardly I think if thres people would rather be in the computer than be with there family and going outside its there dision. They will miss out of the fun with every body they love. Thank you for reading what I had to say. I hope you like it. I also hope think you should think about what I wrotes..."	1866	
1867	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 in a few years everyone in the @LOCATION1 is over weight. That would be horrible. All people do now days is stay on there computer. All you do is sit there looking at a screen. To me computers are just a waste of time. It’s not a real thing, it makes you have less exercise, and it boring. So, you decide if you want everyone to over weight, but I will not be because I don’t sit at my computer all day. “@CAPS5 wheres dad?” “@CAPS6’s on the computer” “@CAPS7 computers,” I’ve asked my @CAPS5 this a lot and dads always there. @CAPS6 says to me look what @CAPS8 @CAPS9 just sent me. I don’t use at all. Its not the real thing. Computers to me are just a waste of time. When you talk to your friends on facebook, isn’t the same as reality. It is better to talk face to face with your friends and family, @CAPS10 thing is lets say your talking to your best friend. When your together you can say whatever you want. Like my friend @PERSON1 we tell each other anything. But, facebook or @CAPS11 you cant say some staff. One more reason is your talking to a girl you like, but you can’t say you love her on the computer. that is just. Therefore we shouldn’t use them like this. “@CAPS12” I always here my name for something because my parents sit on the computer a lot for work and they are so lazy they cant walk downstairs for something. No, they ask me. You see computer make people have less exercise. When people email each other I hate it, why can’t you walk outside to your mail box and send a letter. People don’t move, walk, or do anything they have less exercise. Even if they were on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day they would have in activities, and exercise. Finally, my last reason. Computers are boring. It’s not as interactive as going outside playing with your friends and family. Yeah you talk to people, but it’s in little words on computers. Outside in real world people talk and laugh together because there friends are doing funny things. How is that funny reading that off a computer. It’s not/ @CAPS13 with friends and family socializing is better besides all you’re doing is stareing at a screen. I bet you can go blind if all you do is sit there all day stareing at a screen with your eyes popping out. There is nothing you can do except sit there while you friends are outside playing because your to fat to have fun exercise so you stay on your computer. @CAPS4 kids and families are outside socializing having fun no where near a computer. This is awesome. Nothing is as real as this. Computers are not realy makes you have less exercise, and are boring. So, is it better to sit there bored to death or going out side, execising, having fun with you friends? I say having fin with friends."	1867	
1868	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I was writing to state @CAPS1 opinion about the effects of computers. I think that computers are great and they should only be used when you have to look information upon the internet. Some people are spending to much time on the computer and that is how some people get in trouble, should be doing more things with your family instead of just playing on the computers. I also think that maybe the computers are good for some games but not all of them some are a and some are just plane . One thing you should never do id sing up on things you don't know becuase you can easily get wound in a place that you don't want to be in and that is in some one hime the know and will get you i'll really . I think that more parents should . I have wanted . And I did things . So I only went on the sites that I had to see I would picked up and be able to see big family again . @CAPS1 mom always said to . water, I didn't want that. there was a that had been around some guy on the internet. One day she up missing her parents where she went they had no the girl was she came back her parents didn't think it was her so they abanded her she fallowed them then they finally got convinced it was her now she is happely with her faimly. I hope that I convinced you that alot of people get into trouble and don't know how to get out and they wind up in a ban situation."	1868	
1869	1	"Don't you think that computers help people more than make things ? Computers do help people because they take you to the websites you want to see easily, they make duplicating papers easily, and they make talking much easier. More and more people are starting to use computers the right way by doing their work or research and doing it very quickly. First, computers help you by taking you to all the websites you want to see fast and easily. Whether you want to see how your fantasy baseball team is doing or to your teacher's homework page to see what you have to do that night. When it is in the morning and its cold do you want to go out and get your new paper or would you rather walk from your bedroom to the computer? I'd rather take a couple stops to my computer because they are also very convenient @CAPS1 that @ORGANIZATION1 has come out with the I-phone you basically have a computer in your pocket. The only thing is you can't type a school paper and print it out, which brings me to my second reason. My second reason why I think that having computer is a good thing is because you don't have to write a paper twice or even three times to make copys. Instead make them the easy way by just typing them on your computer. Then just press print and it will have a little box that you how many copys you an you can just put the number of copys whether its two or three, or if you are a teacher and have @NUM1 studens you can print @NUM1. My @NUM3 reason why I think that computers make life easier is because they help you talk to people without having to pick up the phone and having to call them. @CAPS1 there are @CAPS2 messaging which you can have a conversation with someone as if you were face to face talking because it is really fast and they also have e-mail where you can share information about business to other business across town, acrossthe country or even acrossthe world in as fast as a single click of send You can also talk to people on social websites like facebook when you and your friends can be in the same chat group taking back and forth. So why, would you waste your time writing a letter to someone and a week later response or picking up the phone and calling a single person at a time when you can just go on your computer. Are you still wondering whether computer make life easier for people? They do make life easier by showing you what websites you want to see fast and easy, they help making copys of papers faster by selecting the number of copys you want. Instead of rewriting them, and they make chatting with friend faster than writing letters. So the next time you type a paper would you rather be on a typewriter looking through history books or typing on a computer, pulling up information and talking with friend at the same time?"	1869	
1870	1	"To whom this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 has been much controversy over the debate of computers and how helpful they truly are to our society. I would like to share my educated opinion on this subject, I believe computers are a great asset to society for several reasons. The first being that it is the most popular way to get your news via the internet. Secondly, they allow for automation of various things such as machinery to allow less people to have to work on site. And finally, they are very powerful education tools when connected to the internet. Computers are incredibly useful on a worldwide level for news. A study done shows that @PERCENT1 of people get their news from the internet. Infact, of these @PERCENT1, @PERCENT2 of them receive the news from social networking sites such as digg, twitter, and facebook, for example, within @NUM1 minutes of it occuring twit-pics were posted on twitter of the devastating 8.@NUM1 magnitude earthquake that occured in chile. Another great asset computers have on our society is the ability of automation, both physically and on computers themselfs. Physical automation of machinery at a factory means their are less people needed to work on the job site, while still being able to produce an amount equal to or more of goods a normal staff would be able to produce. It could mean less liability's due to a lower staff number, and companys would make more money and be able to continue to innovate and improve their products. This then causes competition and will make other companys feel they should do the same. This will make companies keep innovating to beat the others and could help stimulate the economy. Finally, with a simple computer at your home, you can very easily become rich with knowledge, for if you know what your doing and where to look, it is as if you had an endless encyclopedia which which is constantly updated with more information. They are a great asset to schools and to students as if needed you can access nearly all of your textbooks online. In fact deans of colleges can even agree with and back up this statement. So this was my informed statement on how useful computers truly all, with ease of acces to news..."	1870

Also, they provide us with communciation among friends and family. Futhermore, computer are an exellent way to explore our world. Don't you sometimes wonder what's out there? I know I do. Computers are great for exploring our world that we never knew was there, looking up information, images and or even people. Our world is enormous and not everyone has the opportunity to travel to different countries and places and meet new people so, computers is that one way ticket. Not everyone keeps intouch with family and friends forever. Computers provide communication with loved ones. For example, last @DATE1 my mother on facebook found one of her friends from @LOCATION1. They started to chat and the next thing you know her friend she hasn't seen in @NUM1 years came from @LOCATION2 to vist her. Also, a lot of people move thousands of miles away from their famly. My family and I moved from @LOCATION1 and only sometimes our family comes to visit if they can. We stay in touch with our family through computers. My sister and I go on webcam and talk to our cousin, @CAPS1 all the time. It's really great to have a way to see our family. People all over the world find ways to communicate with each others and a big percentage of those people us computers. Computers are a great way to get up to date with what's going on around us. My mother's boss doesn't have a television so the only way he sees the news is by computer. Others such as I have so many questions about our world or anything at that matter. One of the biggest ways to get my answer is computers. They have the answer to everything. No one knows everything about everything but the computer does! Forty-three out of fifty people say that the easiest and most reliable way to get information or research is the computer. To conclude, many people depend on computers. They have very good benefits to our society today. Such as, providing communication with friends and family. Also, by letting us explore our world in a whole new way and giving us the opportunity to learn new things everyday."	1871	
1872	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have an artcle for you! Computers, just about everyone uses them. What most people don’t know is that they are acually helping them. Computers help people in many ways, they help with hand-eye coordination, they help with information, and even social lives. First computers help with hand-eye coordination. The obvious is the mouse, you need to be able to move the mouse where you want inorder to use a computer. I know I like playing games on the computer. In order to play games you need to not only move the mouse but are the boy board while looking at the screen. Next is computers help with information. Whenever you need to final something out you can go on serch engines like @ORGANIZATION1 or @LOCATION1. It links the whole world so someone knows what your searching for. You can see far away places on computers. You can use programs like @ORGANIZATION1 earth and venture all over the world. Lastly computers are good for a social life. I know just about everyone I know uses either my space or @CAPS3. It's easier to alk to and conect with friends and family online. Say you have family in @LOCATION2. To talk to them or see them you would have to drive to @LOCATION2. Now with computers it's just a click away! You can instant @CAPS4 people, and it's just like talking on the phone but a lot asles! Sure some people spend too much time on their computer but it's fine in moderation. Computers are the new way to socialize, get info, and work an skills like hand-eye coordination."	1872	
1873	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writting this letter to you to inform you on the importance of computers. Computers help with connecting with friends on websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Those two are really popular. These websites helps connect you to your long lost friends. Also computers help with studying @CAPS6 stuff in the world. Also the biggest one is @CAPS7 witch helps you get online text books and strings. These reasonings are vital to people. Todays Technology has adopted since the @NUM1 th century. What a lot of people like me are into these days are social networking sites. @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are two of the biggest. What a big problem is with them are that they are so addicting to young adults and kids. But in reality @CAPS11 not as bad as people. Think they are. They allow you to connect with Friends and also they can help connect you to long lost Friends.They really are good. Whats truly great about computers is how you can go on a ""virtual vacation"" @CAPS9 you want to find world news, @CAPS10! its right at your finger tips. @CAPS9 you wouldd like to look at indian tribes, @CAPS11 you go, you get @NUM2, @NUM3 links. Working with a computer is one of the greatest inventions ever. A truly good thing about the computer is how it can help you with @CAPS7. For our science class we have to use online text books. With that being said we have to log on to @CAPS12.hrw.com. Microsoft has really come up with some real good ideas such as word or outlook. All of them help achieve one thing @CAPS7. They are truly one of the best things computers have. These reason should open your eyes to how important a computer is to an average kid. These three reasons are just a few of the millions of reasons on how important a computer is. So please, read this over care fully and take this in to consideration. Thank you!"	1873	
1874	1	"Dear, editor of local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing for our society. They can allow you to talk online to diffent people. The computer also increases your hand eye cooridination. Also the computer lets you meet faraway people and learn about faraway places. I think that talking online makes the computer a benefit to our society because we could get help for homework or if not if there was any. You could also talk to your friend if the go to a different school or. Another reason why computers are good because you can talk to a relative that you havent seen in while. If you do not have reletives like you could talk to your brother, sister, mom, or dad. Also the internet is a great way to meet new people or learn more about the people you already know. You can meet new people like people your friends know or your friends cousins as friends but its an up to who you want to talk to online. Computers are good for improving hand eye coordination. That can make yo type faster to finish home work or a project. Also the better your hand eye coordination the better you can be in some sports. So people type for fun but what they dont know is their actually improving their hand eye coordination. Some job employers require that you only type never hand write things so if you have good hand eye coordination you could type neatly fast. Therefore the computer improves your hand eye coordination depending on how much you type. The computer can also teach about far away places and by talking to the people that live in their places can you information on their places. You could learn things like why the i usually like or if it has any nice scenery in that country/place."	1874	
1875	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at some point of their life has used a computer, @CAPS3 it was to find specific information or talk to a friend. In @CAPS2 ways, computers benefit so much in our lifes, from giving us news from around the @CAPS7 to watching videos for entertainment. But some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I disagree with the experts because I believe that computers unite the @CAPS7, provides unlimited amounts of information, and can help start a person's carrer. One reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because they can unite the @CAPS7. Ever since the computer was made they have been making new ways to interact with other people, no matter how far away they are. Social websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 allows people to talk with all sorts of people. For instance, if you have a family member living in @LOCATION1, if your family member and you have @CAPS4 accounts you could friend request her and be able to talk whenever you want. Wouldn't you love to be able to talk with far away relatives? I know I would! Another reason why I think computers are beneficial to society is the unlimited amount of information computers have with computers, you can know just about anything you desire. You can find a recipe for chocolate cake, you can find the total amount of men who served in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, seeing nature in person is better than looking it up on your computer, but what you find on the computer not only improves your knowledge on nature, but also can increase your love for it! Finally, I think that computers are beneficial to society because it can launch a person's carrer. For example, my favorite band @CAPS11 @CAPS12 started their carrer on @CAPS5. After word spread about their music labels were drying to sign them. So just by using a computer to post their music on the internet they've become incredibly famous. It's now or never, you can either benefit from what computers can provide you or just always be a step behind. Most importantly, with all the knowledge you have gained from computers you can go on to be a very successful buisnessman or musician. Smart, determined people would take advantage of what computers have to offer. So, if you are smart and determined continue to use your computers and have a great life!"	1875	
1876	1	"Dear local news paper, I am writing about your question about the affects of computers. I think that it does benefit society because you can learn about cultures, you can see all the places in the world, you can interact with your family and friends, and lastly it helps you with hand eye coordination. On computers you can learn about all the cultures of the world, right at your fingertips. Also if you want to know what they do or eat or do for fun you can look that up with a click of a mouse. No more going to the library and spending hours looking up different places in the enciclopedia, and not finding much. Go on the internet, look it up you are bard to find some culture, or mabe even find out about your culture. There is countless cultures to see, find a computer, and look something up! Your bound to learn something knew and exciting. With a computer you can go around the world. By on click of the mouse you can go to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION5, @LOCATION3, ect. With the internet you can travel around the world to see how differrent it is, or how much worse it is than your home country. Seeing the world will open up your mind, it will mkae you appreciate the world for what it is. Also appreciate what you have; to be thankful for your family and friends. The best part is, is that you can explore any place you want, go to australia and see the outback, go to south america and see the @LOCATION4. No danger, just the wild wilderness of the real world. No more boring pictures, go onto google earth and explore the earth, let your mind run free, no more un moving pictures, the real deal. Also watching free online vidios about nature will be even easier, but less interactive. With computers you can interact with other people online, on or in a chat room. If you or your friend moved away, you can talk with a web-cam and see each other instead of writing letters, @CAPS1, or emailing. It is like he/she is right there next to you. The stone age is over, there's technology, use it interact with old buddies, talk with them almost face-to-face. Computer chats are the way to go! While using a computer is good, using to much is bad. Kids these days should spend more time outside, away from technology. They should explore the real nature, not to nature. But that doesnt mean you shouldn't use the computer it just means don't over use it. We still need to interact with the real world. Use it but but don't abuse it! Lastly computers help with hand-eye coordination. Witch is good for all most every most every known to man. Using computers increases your hand-eye coordination. So once in a while play a computer game, just improve it so you can use it in sports. In conclusion, I think computers benefit society in a positive way. I think that evry one, one in a wile should go on a computers and explore it. Computers help you with learning about different cultures, seeing around the world and its nature, interactin with people online. But don't over use it. Computers are absolutly wonderful but nothing compare to the real world. Like famous computer inventor @PERSON1 said, ""Computers can help us in every day life, but nothing can compare with what is realy out there!"""	1876	
1877	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: I have recently read that computers of becoming very will now and used for many things. The survey in your article said that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 - children use the computer a day. In my opinion we should have the computer. Firstly, Computers help you with school. The way computers help in in school is they also you to look up many important things you @MONTH1 need for a project or homework. @PERSON1 a teacher at the middle school in @LOCATION1 said that @PERCENT2 of the teachers use the computer for class to give students vissuals on what they are learning. These days the computer is used more and more for schooling and such, people have online colledge corces if they can now go to school. Profsaer @PERSON2 said that @PERCENT3 of his students use the computer for school for class assignments such as textbooks that are online. That is why computers are important for school. Secondly, you can talk to people I socialize with friends. Which is good because you need to talk to family & friends that away or live in a different such day is. @PERSON2 says""@CAPS1 & teens are socializing though computer this way thatn and."" The computer protecs people from harm. How? you are probably saying well if people hear your through the phone then they you and could That is why talking through computer is not a idea at all. Thirdly, you can use the computer to learn about faraway places people. While you are on the computer you don't just play games or chat you use it for about people that are famous and very well know. I remember when I was in history in @NUM1 grade I had to write about a musition and I did and I found realy good info about @CAPS2 and him, so computers are a big part of learning & projects acts.. As you can see computer are good for learning about faraway places & people. In conclusion, computers have a very big effect on people. My reasons are schooling, socializing, and lastly learning about faraway places and people. I urge you to keep computers. I know hand this important desition to you, pleas make the right one."	1877	
1878	1	"As computers and the internet become so populer, more people start to say that they are having a negative affect so society. They say that people spend more time on their computers and less time getting outside and being healthy. I strongly disagree with this. Computers help in many way. They help the environment and are a better news service. There even more ways that they can help. Computers can store a lot of information. They save this information of having to keep it on paper. With all the info it stores, there's a lot of paper you wouldn't need to use. This is why computers are for the environment. People have to cut down trees to get paper. If paper is used less, then would be cut down less. When your getting news off the computer, you're saving trees too. You're getting news off of the computer instead of the neewspaper. Newspapers are made of paper. It's in their name. Using the computer is less paper being used and that save trees. Newspapers get their information, they they have to put in a newspaper and it the next day. It's day old news. On the computer news can be set as fast as minutes it happens. News in much faster and reliable on a computer. You also don't have to wait until the newspaper comes to your to get the news. Some newspaper companies don't deliver the paper until @NUM1 at @NUM2 o'clock in the @TIME1. On the computer you can just go on the internet and click on the news. Which would only take about @NUM3 seconds. News on the computer is much @CAPS1 of the more recent luxuries of the computer is socializing. There are many ways you can talk with your friends on the internet. You can talk with your friends on @CAPS2. You could also dont on @CAPS3. The best part of it is that it's all completely @CAPS4. If use your phone, you have to pay for the minutes. Not on the computer. I hope you can see how the computer makes so many tasks easier and fast. Or how the computer is very helpful for the environment. You can socialize on it and you can find news on it. It's just the better choices."	1878	
1879	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 editors you decide what stories get to be put in our newspaper. I would like you to include my article on computers. I beleive computers have good and bad affects on people. Computers are dangerous, and not very healthy. However, they are a great tool for learning. On the other hand, computers are very addicting and can take control of your life. First of all, computers can be very dangerous. Especially when it involves the internet. There are many website such @CAPS2 facebook, twitter, and myspace where you can have your own profile that strangers @MONTH1 view. Nothing on the internet is private, therefore when naughty pictures are released, you can get in big trouble. My neighbor, went to a party where there was alcohol and a lot of bad people. She had fun, but her friends took pictures and put them on facebook. She is very smart and applied for @ORGANIZATION2, a college in @LOCATION1. Unfortunatley, she did not know the board of @ORGANIZATION2 and all other colleges, check facebook for innappropriate pictures. Therefore, she was not accepted into @ORGANIZATION2, not because she wasn't smart, but because of the innappropriate drinking pictures that went on facebook. Secondly, computers are very unhealthy, because of several reasons. One reason is because they are so addicting and time flies when you are on them. @NUM1 out @NUM2 teenagers do nothing but computer/internet when they get home. Their bodies need exercise! ""@CAPS3-a-days, technology is getting more and more advanced, and all people aren't exercising enough. We are all refreshing our internet explorer page for the lastest update!"" says @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1. Some parents @MONTH1 think their kids being on the computer @NUM3 is good practice for being the next ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5,"" but it's just a waste of time and unhealthy. However, even though computers @MONTH1 be unhealthy and dangerous, they are great for school work and learning. When the internet is not being used for chatting and profile-ing, it is a great way to be taught more and exciting things. ""@CAPS6"" is a great website to search the web and to use for finding biographies and research landmarks or historical moments or figures. Other websites such @CAPS2, ""ask.com"" and ""wikipedia.com"" are excellent for looking for pictures of places for a power point presentation. Not everyone has the money to travel, so why not look on the internet for a beautiful island, close your eyes, and pretend you're there?! In conclusion, computers are horrible for our bodies, dangerous for our safety, yet wonderful for school use. Please put this article in our local newspaper. That way maybe people will change their way of living, and not live like the slabs I see all of us becoming. Thank you for your time."	1879	
1880	1	"Dear Newspaper editor, I have been notified about the recent argument concerning wether or not computers give ""positive"" or ""negative"" affects on people. In personally believe they give off a positive affects. My reason for believing that is based on my own life expireance and on what I have seen. I have no siblings, so I'm always alone. I get depressed from that fact, but the internet provided me with people to talk to. I can also study for the many harsh things that can come up in school. Last my father is in @LOCATION1, so that means hes not here to show me love, but with the internet I can @CAPS1 cam with him, which will make me not worry alot. All my life I have been alone, I have no siblings to keep me company. Although I have friends that are like brothers to me, that still isn't enough to fill my loneliness wen I feel lonely, I turn to the internet. It allows me to chat with people from all places. Wen im talking I feel happy and not lonely. School can be rough; the home work, test, reports. Without internet, you probably would not finish half the stuff you are suppose to finish in that ammount of time. With internet, I can study for those important test's, and finish those important assingnments. My father is in the @ORGANIZATION1 wich means hes always being deployed for an extended period of time. Wen that happens, our communication is limited. We found a solution to this and its called ""@CAPS1 caming"", thanks to the interest I can check up on my father and make sure hes ok. Also my father can do the same with me. I can see his face and let my worries leave my mind, so that I can focus on school and other equally important things. Well that is my opinion on the computer argument. It not only helps me with lonelyness, school, and communication, but much more than that. It also helps millions and millions of other people."	1880	
1881	1	"It's better for people to spend more time on computers because with out them we can not make now enventions. Students also can not check there school work @CAPS1 they missed any friends also can not communicate with each other @CAPS1 they're far away. with out people spending on computers life will be harder for every one. @CAPS1 people don't spend time on computers, it will be harder to com up with new enventions. maybe car components will will come less and less advancer and withut computers cars can not run. The reason why is because a computere in a car is how you steer, or accelerate, even put the heater or A.C. on. The car wouldn't know what to do. a major reason why we need computers is the military. @CAPS1 we didn't have then in the military we wouldn't knoe ehat or how to get into a biulding. We also wouldn't know were people are because we wouldn't have access to satelite. Another reason why we need computers is to make more efficient ways to make the earth healthier so we don't polute the air with power plants. with out computers kids can not larn the right way. It would be hard for kids to amazin what the teacher is trying to say. @CAPS1 we didn't have mime boards we can't have an interactive way and fun way to learn, @CAPS1 we keep enventing new technology for school students will be able to visualize history better. Also @CAPS1 a student was abscent he couldn't go online to check or checking his website. @CAPS1 You have friends that either live in a different state you wouldn't be able to communicate with him. People coudn't talk to each other online or type to each other. @CAPS1 you have a relitive or someone closely related in college you couldn't talk to him unless you send letters, letter are usaully reall slow to get to each other, but by computers you can see each other instatly without computers the world can not function. @CAPS1 people didn't use computers the world would not turn. People can not communicate the way they want to. People can not event things, military would be falling apart. This is my opinion why poeple need to use computers."	1881	
1882	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you because computers are effecting people these days. Starting with myspace it's causing people to not interact with family members. Theres a lot of websites out there many of them are causing problems like I don't know alot too many. Then theres games people spend more time doing that than going to work, going to school and doing things there supposed to do. There not doing any of this because there on computers all day. I think if there wasn't access to all of this there would be more people doing what they got to do. I believe there should be less websites so peole come able to go to school and work instead of being unhealthy."	1882	
1883	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that all people spend time on the computer but only what they can handle. My reason of sayin this is because firstly learning, c ommuncate with people, projects. Firstly, On the computer you can learn alot of things that your probaly really interested in. Like say your interested in being a lawyer or say maybe getting in to real state. They really @CAPS1 teach things like that in school. Wouldn't you agree? An maybe even your family is going on a vaction and you wanna learn about the place. An diffent fun places you can go. Second, I cant see my freinds everyday or call the either. So the best simplist way is to talk to them on the computer. And if one of my family member or even freinds live really far an your unable to call. I can go on the computer an talk. Wouldn't you agree. An in my experinents I havent talk to my best freind from third grade till she moved. and I found her page on the computer and started talking again it was amazing I could I was taking her years inst amazing? Isn't it amazing how you can learn about basicaly amost anything. So if doing a project all I have to do is go on the computer looking in encyclopedia instead all i have to type in the subject/topic and all my info is right infront of me. An it can also teach me now to speak other lanuges. Som people even take college over a computer. And I can't go without comptures never did since @CAPS2 born. Learning communacition. are the reason people are on the computer so much. I hastley, think people are not spending too much time if thats why they so be it."	1883	
1884	1	"One does not believe in the wonder of computers because they don't benefit society at all. Statistics have shown that @PERCENT1 of kids who go on the computer research bad sites and see thinks that kids their age should not see. It is not good for children's health to always be on the computer as soon as they got home from school. If we banish computer or at least brought the use down to a minimum we would still be able to do the same exact things without computers. One does not believe in the use of computers. Computers do not benefit society at all. When kids got on the computer they almost always research bad things their parents wouldnt want them to see. Kids go onto bad sites when they @PERCENT2 of the kids have been bullied at least twice on the internet. When you are on those ""chat rooms"" not only can you be bullied but you @MONTH1 be talking to a creeper when you really, this is exspecially dangerous girls and @PERCENT3 of girls chat and only @PERCENT4 of guys chat so it is more likely for girls to be talking to bad guys. This is why one thinks computers are bad for our society. When you are always can you are out as you do not get outside as much so your system is not as built up. You also could get germs off of the key board. %@PERCENT6 of the people who come down with swine flu got it off of a computer. Computer hurt our society and are not good for them. When you have a computer you think you can not live with out it, but you can. You could get your info from an encyclopedia. Your grandparents could help you a lot with history. You could even talk to your friends on to phone, what a concept. You can get @PERCENT5 of you info not on the computer, our society does not need computers. One does not believe in computers. You go on bad sites when you are on the computer. Kids are not as healthy when they go on the computer. You are able to do everything without computers says @CAPS1 computers. Society does not need this extra thing hurting them because they don't benefit our society. I do not support computer."	1884	
1885	1	"It has come to my attention people are beginning to controverse on what effect computer have on people. In my opiinon I believe computers have a had effect on people.First, many people are becoming obeast because they spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising. Next kids are starting to fail and not focus on their homework cause they waste so much time on the computer, @CAPS1 computers can cause arguments between families fighting over who goes on it when. i believe computers have a bad affect on people cause they take up the time kids could be exercising kids need to be active and get a certain amount of exrcise a day in oredr to stay healhty. Every ones so wrapped up in computers these days that they don't think to go outside. This is the cause why kids are coming and not staying in shape. Everyones so anxious to go home and get on their computer they don't even think about sports and outdoor activities anymore. Its time a stand and get people back in by limiting computer time. Computer people because kids are spending so much time on computers they don't do their homework anymore or focus on studying for /test. I believe this is the reason grades are getting so poor. Everyone's so wnated about going home on facebook talking to ther friends on aim and computer games. They don't even about their should work and the of it. I can net you if computers were taken away for a week kids start doing their school work again because they would have nothing better to do. Let's begin to getting grades back up to atleast average. Finally, computers can cause arguments between families fighting over who goes on it first, when kids get home from school theres no doubt theyw ant to go on right away. This will cause siblings to argue and parents to become stressed. Parents are stressed enough already when they come home from work they don't want un needed tension when they go home too. No computers will help releave stress off parents! After reading this I hope you come to an arguments with me. Computers are the reason kids are becoming abeast and not exercising. Second, computer cause kids to fail and not focus on their school work. LAst but not least computers can cause un wanted argument between families. Let's stop all this by getting everyone to see computers have a bad affect on people!"	1885	
1886	1	"Dear editor, @CAPS1 are many amazing pieces of advanced technology. A computer is one of them. Computers can be good for all sorts of things, but if you look the advantages @CAPS1 are a few disadvantages about the uses of them. Computers have become more popular over the years, more people are buying them and using them. The many if them are putting drawbacks on our lives. Based on the amount of time people spend on the computer, they are not doing or exercise, not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Not doing much exercising can lead to an unhealthy life. In order to stay healthy, besides eating healthful foods, a big contributor is the amount of exercise.

Every once in a while it is good to get in your body. Inside @CAPS1 is no. Outside, @CAPS1 is plenty. If you don't want to go outside alone, go with a family member or a friend. Family and friends help us determin who we are. In our family we special bonds with each other that in our life time. The computer takes this away. Connecting to each other will give us something to talk about. When we all get along we support each other through everything. When we spend time on the computer it doesnt allow us to connect, bond, or gather support. Even though @CAPS1 are many advantages to the computer, @CAPS1 are disadvantages that effect us more.

1887	1	"Dear local newspaper editor, I heard you were finding out who supports and doesnt support computer usage. Well I support the usage because I think you can learn more with it. Also it gives you good hand-eye cordination and you can talk to the people all around the country. Here is some more ideas why I support it. Lets say you are doing your homework and theres this one math problem that you dont get. You can just go on your computer and find out steps of how to get through it. Plus you can learn about other countries or specific places or even some famous person. So lets say you want to learn about @PERSON1, you can just go on your computer, type his name in and boom, everything you want to know about him. That was a reason why I support the asage. Another reason is that if you play online games, it could be your hand-eye cordination. Also just for not games that so really you good problem. The final reason is that you can talk to people through the internet. They could be your friends, family or in another country. The people who are not supporting it said that computer time takes away time from friends and family. Well I disagree with that. Online you can chat with friends and family either through a chat room or video chat. Plus lets say you have a family member in @LOCATION1 and you want to talk to him, you can do that on the computer. That was another reason why I support it. So these were the reasons why I support the usage of the computer. It helps you learn new things, helps your hand eye cordination and you can talk to friends and family."	1887	
1888	1	"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers and technology have over all benifited our society. They help widen everyone's communication, provide new educational opertunities, and help advance businesses. Communication is a huge part of our daily lives , but sometimes it's not always easy to reach, contact with people. Computers help us stay close with family and friends because let's face it with crazy air fair prices today not everyone can afford to visit their families. With computers talking to your loved ones is just a couple of clicks away. Web cams allow you to talk and see the person you're communicating with, so it's like they're right there in the room with you. Not to mention think of all the friendships computers have saved. It's always sad when a dear friend moves but with e-mail, chat rooms, and web cams it's like your best curious towards different places, cultures and people which is why computers are so important. If you want to know about a different place all you have to do is go to @LOCATION1 and look it up, plus you canhave friends all over the world something we couldn't do with out computers. Computers have provided so many new educational opertunities for people. Think about how school use yo be the teacher would teach, stbudents would right out papers by hand, and they would have to carry around those back breaking books. Now kids can type out almost anything, have fun video projects, and head online bmooks so no one has to deal with a heavy back pack. It's also easier for teachers think of that of how hard it must have been to keep track of grades, homework, and who showed up for class that's a lot of stress on one person now everything is in an organized system. Plus kids don't have to go through hours of book research when thay can look up almost anything online. Computers also play a huge role in the business world. Large and small compinies depend on computers to keep everything organized. Yes includes pay checks, files, and customer information could you imagine what would happen if we wake up one morning and there were no computers? All the businesses would be so un origanized and unadvanced. Because of computers people stay closer, businesses can thrive, and new educational opertunities are created every day."	1888	
1889	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 teens are online @NUM1 chatting with friends and surfing the web. I personally think we should get off the computer. If you want to talk to someone, just call them! With a computer, it can start a lot of drama too! And lastly, we should enjoy nature! So obviouly computers have a larg effect on people! Keep reading to hear my reasoning. The first reason why I think computers effect us is because we get attached to talking to people from a computer! We are use to going on facebook and @CAPS5 everyone. If you really want to talk to them, just call them. Also we need to spend time with our family. If you get off the computer, then you can see them more. So computers have a large effect on us! Keep reading to hear more. Another reason why i think teens need to get off the computer is because it can start drama. I think everyone has heard of the @ORGANIZATION1, now his son killed himself, and it had something to do with the computer. Also, a lot of people learn that saying something mean to someone through a screen is a lot easier than to there face. This all starts a lot of drama, and can really hurt someone. My last reason of why being on the computer effects people is because kids to to enjoy nature. Take a walk, go for a bike ride, do anything! You get, and dont want to do anything after sitting on the computer! You could even gain weight from just sitting looking at a screen all day. You need to get energy, go play with friends! Just get off the computer!!! So I hope I made my point clear. I would be better if you get off the computer. Just call someone is you want to talk to them. And being on the computer can start drama. Lastly, you should enjoy nature and go out side. I really hope you agree with me that we need to get off the computer."	1889	
1890	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 computers are often useful, there are various reasons why they do not benefit the society. Computers read to inactive and overwieght people. In addition, time on the computer takes away time that should be spent with family and frineds. Lastly, computers can be extremely dangerous. Children can easily access unsafe website. this comes to show that computers are hurting our society every single day. When teens come home from school, one of the first things they do is turn on their laptop or computer. People sit down infront of the screen for hours and hours instead of being outside & working their body. As you know, obesity is certainly a problem in @LOCATION1, and computers clearly are not helping this issue. Computer addicts are too busy searching the web or playing games to get some exercise and fresh air. Instead of palying, of teens the computer. This proves that using computer too much is defenitely for. Time spent on a computer is also time spent away from family and friends. People choose to be alone on the computer over interacting with other people. This strongly interfere with social skills. Studies show that it is very important to be around your family as often as possible. However, computers make it difficult for people to be around friends and family. FInally, computers cause harm to teens everyday. Children who have free acsess to internet are often going in dangerous websites. For example, in the last week, the ""chat"" has been allows anyone to video chat with any complete stranger various websites around the world involve talking to complete strangers in amy ways this can be very harmful. Therefore, people using computers are always at risk. In conclusion, computers aren't as important as many people think. In fact. they just cause problems. Computers & laptops lead to people not exercising and becoming unhealthy. Next, computers interfer with people interacting with family and friends which can cause social problems. Lastly, computers are dangerous for everyone in various ways. Therefore, computers have a very bad effect on people all over the world. "	1890

Yes, if you go on for a couple minutes a day to do research or homework it benefits you, but most of the time it makes you lazy, you don't do anything obesity is a problem and how are our future generations goint to know how to use a library. My sister is a good example. Using compters don't always us. She is on the computer from when get home from school at three till when we have to go to bed. I always wonder what she does that makes her stay on that long but all it is a computer game. How is a video game beneficial? It makes her not do anything. I always end up her chores and talking the out. This generation (@NUM1) is different then the previous ones. Childhood obesity is huge @NUM2 kids are obese from the ages of two up. This isn't only because of the food we eat but also because of the technology we have. Kids today sit around all day on the computer and using cell phones to talk to friends when you could be outside riding bikes and playing basketball. How does kids being overweight contribute to this socity? What kind of message are we sending to people if we only use the computer ot do things such as research and talking to friends, when you can walk to a library or friends house? If we always do research on the computer than are kids going to know use a library or dictionary? These would no use of the encyclepedias and alases if all you have to do is type in a word and everything you need to is right there. Some of the information might not even be acurate. How would you feel if you wrote an encyclopedia nad it's not used for anything? It wouldn't be a good feeling I know that much. Not all kids feel thesame way but what they don't know that what that day isn't getting and you supposed to get at least thiety minutes of exercise a day when some people's only source or activity is gym class. Almost all kids are probably lazier than you were as a kid, they might not have and instead be on the computer you dinner. On chat systems you might think you are talking to your friend? You won't know because you can't see who your talking to."	1891	
1892	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people our community use computers was an essenciail port of day-to-day. However, little do they known, the interaction between computers and humans can be negative. First of all, when going online, you discuss your thoughts with virtualpeople, rather than reel friends. Also, you do not recieve the required exercise and sunlight your body needs to provide to stay healthy. Finally, computers are a large distractron in the eyes of teenagers and students. Computers not only are negative, but decrease the ability of soeralizing in schools and other places in our community. Throught online chat rooms, facebook, and other anteractions between a group of people, can not only be harmful, but dangerous. For instance, @PERCENT1 of middle school students decide to become friends with or talk to people they never even heard of as seen before. As a result, you are trusting a figure you have never physically seen before, who might as well be sharing your personal information. Another reason that virtual negative, is because of the of socializing. Through recent studies, @NUM1 people only talk on facebook, without greeting one another in public. This can not only decrease your ability of speaking in public or in front of a group, but the idea of interacting with other people your age. Finally, virtual people on different networks can be figures that are harmful or not feel you who they. For instance, one girl from @LOCATION1 didn't know her ""bestfriend"" on facebook was a @NUM2-year-old man seeking information from her. However, the idea of no exercise appears to as important. Without exercise and the ability to get from sunlight, your body won't function properly. For instance, the required amount of hours to receive exercise is one hour per day. With on message of the goal won't be reached. reason exercise could be a top priority, because of the avaiable sunlight scientists have recently discovered that teenagers stay up late because of lock of sunlight while on the computer. As a result teen not receiving the proper sunlight but sleep grades. Finally, one last reason, is how children end even adults over the years have became choose, and overweight. The main factor is the race of sitting in front of your computer for more than @NUM3 hours a day. Exercise and socializing not only effect humans, but serve as a as well. Through online gaming and other programs on computers, these factors can serve as a huge distractions. For instance in @DATE1, @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 students didn't or forgot to do each task or assignment from school, due to computers. This both decreases and the to focus as well. Another aspect, its how teenagers are denying and disobeying chores given to them by parents. For instance, I remember being @NUM6, and telling my mother I would set the table, but was @NUM7 minutes late because of of a program. I was playing. This resulted in both a consequence and disadvantages lack responsibility one last reason, you @MONTH1 be an important stuation, but then decide to take a break. Without a time unit humans go on the internet not knowing how much time they have actually sent of it. All hree of these aspects to why computers are negative. Ever since the manufacturing of computers began all ages have been interested in the technology. However, computers are unsafe, due to virtual friends, hours of exercise have gone down, and people have continued to be distracted. Even though the world needs technology computers have their flaws."	1892	
1893	1	"Do you know that the average mailing letter takes more than @NUM1 days to get to the designated area? Obviously, that is a long time for something to get to somewhere else! Computers help you get the message to the person you want to read it faster. They are great for free time and research too! @CAPS9 are a definate improvement in society! In the world of communication, @PERCENT1 of students in my school prefer the use of @CAPS1-mail and @CAPS2. I mean come on, who wouldn't like it better? I is about @NUM2 faster than old fashioned snail-mail. It is also more accurate. Letter sent through the mail have to go through different post offices and then a mailman has to deliver through all of that the letter @MONTH1 get damaged, it could be loss, or it could to the wrong house! Machines are a lot more accurat in getting to the absolute destination. I have to admit, I do spend alot of time online. But most of it is not bad for me. In my I go on website, I of the stories people write about ! It's a great me. In addition kids get together and play outside, if theyre always calling, the phone will be tied up. What's the solution to this? Mentioned before were @CAPS1-mail and @CAPS2. kids can interact the phonebill. Computers are also great for sharing digital pictures. You can send those is an @CAPS1-mail too!. Imagine this, your teacher give you a research paper that is due in @NUM1 days. You run to the library but all of the subject have been checked out! What do you do? Of course, you to use the @CAPS9 for gathering information. There are some really cool websites for that. They have experts behind them that get kids information and online for everone to know! When kids don't have the neatest handwrinting, the paper @MONTH1 look sloppy even though they worked hard on it. With typing and printing, the papers automaticly look better than if they used it. Fare it, Computers are just better for. Say ""@CAPS6 More"" to snail mail, and ""@CAPS7"" to @CAPS1-mail. Dont be scared when the library has @CAPS6 books on what your looking to research. Not @CAPS10 on the @CAPS9 bad. I know you agree with me, @CAPS9 are a great improvement to @CAPS10!"	1893	
1894	1	"Computers help people learn about other places. They help meet people online even, but computers shouldnt be used every second of the day. Instead of watching a screen for most of the day people should go exercise, see nature, and enjoy the company of family and friends. Using a computer all day can make people fat because of the lack of exircise. So the computer can help you with research, or information on current events, but can it make thin just by stairing at a screen? Dr. @DR1 stated"" @CAPS1 is growing to be very common in the average home, and part of the reason is people are using there computers way to much."" People should be out running or looking plants. Looking at nature is beautiful and it keeps many off the computer. Some prefer watching insects roam more then a computer game. Nature is intresting to watch and it will keep you active. Computers can ruin your eyes and a plant or an insect or a tree cant do that. If your on a computer for to long you could have a seizure while you are on it. Nature cant to that while your outside. People should see and enjoy there family and friends as often as possible. If you stay on a computer for hours you seem like an old hermet not seeing anyone. Family and friends are very important. Seeing them will make both you and them happy. A computer is no friend it can be addictive. Even if a computer seems like the only thing to do, go out with some friends. Computers can be fun, and help get your walk done, but they can be bad too. If you feel the use to go on the computer right it and go exirsice, or explore nature, or even go with some friends, just dont go on the computer."	1894	
1895	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4't you like to have a lower electric bill each month? What about saving the planet? Imagine trying to have a conversation with your child and they don't respond because their glued to the computer screen. The issue to grapple with is, would you like to have a face to face conversation with someone than them being glued to the computer. I strongly suggest that we all do the green thing and shut are computers off and enjoy the beauty of nature. Without a doubt computers are grate but the take away from family time. Second, not enough kids are exercizing because of them. Lastly, people arn't gitting enough fresh air, from the outdoors. People and families all around the world don't talk with their families enough any more. I know when I am talking to a family member or friend I would rather do it face to face than me looking at them and their looks at the computer screen. I could remember a time when a friend of mine was mindlesley watching the computer screen and something just killed her computer and thats when she realized that your family matters more than looking up pointless stuff on the internet. I know states all over the country are complaining about child obeseaty and people not getting enough exercise. If some states provide schools with computes than why cant the provide them with healthy food as well. Don't you like the satisfaction of a good run or lifting a few wates? Why would you then go sit in front of the lousy computer. Imagine being over weight in highschool and a computer geak. So go out today and lose @NUM1 pounds for your next highschool reunion. Shouldn't we all do the green thing and just shut off our computer and enjoy the beautiful nature raight out side. @PERCENT1 of the reason that scientest predict our beautiful eart @MONTH1 die in @DATE1 is because of to many non degradable electronic devices such as computers. ""I sure would like to finish the eighth grade"" says young @NUM2 grade student @PERSON1. I say we let him. Without a doubt computers are an excelent helpful tool but they are destroying our @NUM3 of a kind earth. Imagine what the sports teams would look like if all the kids layed of the computer and goined a sports team. I strong ly advise that more and more people should shut their computer off and walk away. More kids need to exercise and socelize with their family. Lastly they should enjoy nature before its all gone. Now is the time to do the green thing before its to late. The issue to graple with is to you believe that computers have a negative affect on society or not. So go out today and shut your computer off!"	1895	
1896	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I think computers have great effects on people. People could learn a lot from computer. Some say that computers make people more lazy but I think that is only for a person the already is lazy Not everyone. Computers help people learn about things more effectfully unlike textbooks. When learning on a computer you learn about things in a fun way by playing games or watching movies, you could learn about faraway people and places a lot easier. Computers help people talk to their family and friends easy even if you are in @LOCATION1 and your friend moved away to texas you could video chat or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fast and fun. It could help with hand-eye coordination when playing games because you move the mouse fast and you press @CAPS3 fast and could help you with hand-eye coordination. Some people say that computers make people lazy on computers you can play an exercise video and work out while you are on the computers. Computers have made many people happy you can and print then and then a lot then typing them. Computers help @CAPS4 find cures and medical advances to cure sick people. Many Computers help people work from home so they could take care children. Computers help manage their money, without computers a lot of things have ever came about.

1897	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how i feel about ocmputer. I think computers are very dangerous. You need to be caustious about what you post on websites, you should only talk to your friends and family (never anyone you don't know), and if other people are harassing you over the internet you must @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Talking in open chat rooms can be very dangerous. People in those chat rooms could to you about your age, trick you so you @CAPS2 them everything about you, and then are day finally meet them in person. Now a day, people are getting killed, raped and who knows what else because parents don't relize their child is talking to strangers in chat rooms. Things like open chat rooms can be and are extreamly dangerous. You need to be more cautious about these chatrooms. Identity theft is happening alot more these days. E-mails that track you saying their you credit card company or even pop-ups that say you wan stuff. Some people, don't relize that the're fake! Once you enter all you information in such as, @CAPS1, address, phone number, social security, or credit card number, you will never be able to get that information back. This is how most peoples identity gets stolen. So, don't let those e-mails, and pop-ups trick you. The internet is most popular for cyber bulling. Cyber bulling is when you are , or harassing @CAPS3 or even a group of people. Myspace, facebook and e-mailing is how most cyber bulling is done. The person who is bulling people normally hides their identity so you wont find out who it is. This is a major problem. When you recieve things that you think is like bullying, threaining or @CAPS3 haunting you @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! Don't wait until the problem get worse, you must @CAPS2 @CAPS3 right away. This way if you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, they could stop it imeditaly. In conclusion, I think the computer is unsafe. The computer can be very dangerous and if you don't watch you children while they are on the computer, they could be in danger. They @MONTH1 even be getting cyber buillied, or even entering information on websites that they shouldn't. I hope that my opinions about computers persuaded you to agree with me."	1897

I believe people should spend less time on the computer. Here are my reason why, it could damage your brain. You would be less focus in school. Lastly you will forget things. Have your head started to hurt? Well I know what is one problem and it is computers. If you stoped on a computer for @NUM1 hours straight then your eyes would start to hurt and eventually your brain will be hurting too. Study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer for to long will start feeling pain in their head. Well I believe that if you stay on the computer to long then you will just get a pain in your head.""@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Oh yeah! What is the answer to the question?"" Have you been off focus and thought about something else? Well most likely you are thinking about a computer. If so then stop thinking about it. Computers can get you off task in class sometimes because you probably are worried about who would be on facebook or not. In this case a computer can get you no where in school so what is the point in thinking about. My final reason is computer can make you forget things like homework or projects. This is bad and not good for your grades. in an instant your grades would go down if you forget things. The cause of this is when you have something to do for school then you would say I will do it later and go on the computer. Well once you get off you might think you have nothing to do because you absorb to much tofu, on the computer. In the end computers can hurt you a lot from school to all sorts of things. I believe people should spend less time and do something else like sports. I urge you to agree with me."	1898

1901	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I stand firm in my belief that technology benefits society. Mostly computers I for one use computers everyday and while I don't really get out much, I don't spend all my time on this machine. First of all, computers provide things for children and aults to do and that helps to lessen crime on the streets. Less crime means happier citizens and less garvage effectively keeping the cities a lot nicer. More people would go out with a definate purpose and might not get involved in some activities they could have if they just wandered around aimlessly. Another reason is that computers provide a way to help contact people you wouldn't meet any other way. There are many sites like deviant art and youtube that can help to find people like that and they also provide a way of getting people together who have mutual interests. I have made a few friends this way myself when I otherwise would normally avoid people in the real world. Lastly, my computer has been able to help me learn various things. I have been able to help my fictional writing by reading fanfiction on the internet. I have also been able to teach my self basic japanese through articles and songs. Actually, I've even been able to teach myself how to access my lower singing range through aforementioned japaness songs. Therefore the internet gives me an outlet to practice my many hobbies. In conclusion I think computers can benefit society in numerous ways. These machines have certinly helped me out during life. I know there's a way to balance real life and play time and we can only hope veryone will find it too."	1901	
1902	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought of how many people are using computers thes days? The number of computer user has increased by so much since the beginning of the creation. I have to say computers can definetly be helpful, but think of all the down falls computers have also kids can go online to sites and talk to complete strangers, instead of doing other things like chores or going inside they stay inside on the computer, and children, particularly, choose to play games on them instead of homework. Now would you like this going on in your house? Online sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and plain old chatrooms enable children of any conversational age to talk to strangers. On these sites groomers (adults that pretend to be children to get personal info) can be found. Children @MONTH1 not know the dangers of these kind of people so they can fall into the trap. Kids @MONTH1 also lie of their age to get older people to talk to them which can be a bad idea. For it is considered fraud. Some people in chatrooms like to cyber bully also. Cyber bullying can cause a minor depression, which can lead to dangerous acts or even suicide. ""Not now, @CAPS3 I'm playing a game!"", ""I'll be down in a little while"", and ""I'm busy"". Are these statements you hear from your children while they're on the computer? I know my @CAPS3 surely hear it, and it gets annoying! Kids under the age of @NUM1 these days are on the computer so much playing games and talking to friends we barely do anything else, anymore. Back when there weren't any computers kids would play sports, go outside, or even help out around the house. Ever since computers came out though more and more children are sticking to the online-indoor life. This lifestyle can lead to health problems, and who wants those? If you look at our homework list we do not get alot of it but the question: is why isn't this little amount of homework getting done? The answer to this is partically computer's faults. Particularly children these days are picking to go on the computer before or even instead of doing homework. We tell ourselves ""@CAPS4 yeah I'll only go on for @NUM2 minutes then do my homework right after"", but then we forget. Yeah, computers can help us, but they can also drag us down. Missing homework can lead to bad grades, which can lead to a slighter chance of getting into a good college. So, you @MONTH1 be saying computers are still good and helpful, but at least you also got to see the negatives of them. Children talking to strangers, spending more time on the computer then anything else, and using them instead of homework, are all not fantastic qualities. You can still use computers, but at least consider the idea of safer computers, and time charts. In can not only help out your lives but your kid's lives also."	1902	
1903	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 some people @MONTH1 say that computers are harmful, I strongly believe they benifit society a lot. Three reasons why are, people can develop important typing skills which can be helpful for jobs. Students can use computers as a good source for reasearch and projects, and it's a fun and easy way to connect with friends, or even faraway family. The first reason I chose is that people can develop important typing skills, which can be very helpful when you go on job interviews. "" A lot of big, highpaying, important jobs require knowing to type well"", says rich buisness man, @PERSON1. If you go into a job interview without "" typing well"" on your resumay, then there is deffinitly a smaller chance of you getting the career you want. Another important reason that shows computers are beneficial to societly, is that they help with research for projects and school. Some people would say books are the way to go for reasearch, but computers are faster, easier, and overall more fun and intresting to use. Do your really want students being bored, and unmotivated for school?! My last reason is that using computers can help people connect with others. There's millions of different ways to that fit everybodys needs to communicate with friends and even far away family. For example, my laptop helped my family connect with my cousings, aunt, and uncle from @ORGANIZATION1. We even web chatted with them on @ORGANIZATION2! Don't you think communicating and connecting with long lost familly is amazing? As you can see, computers don't hurt or harm people... They actually do the exact opposite. Computers, help people to develop typing skills for jobs, make it enjoyable and simple to do projects and research, and are a great way to reconnect with family, and connect with friends."	1903	
1904	1	"I think that it's not a good idea to be on the computer all day. I only use the computer to go on facebook and check what people are saying on my wall post or messages. Excercising is more important. Everyday of the week i usually go on the computer for a limited amount of time. I'm not addicted to it and i don't let it become a habit. I thnk computers arent even ncoded anymore. We all have major good phones that have better and smarter things on them that just do the exact same thing. You could be walking while your using it. I excercise daily, i think it's important to be healty and strong. People spend way to much time on the computer and don't excersice. If you dont excercise bad things are going to happen to your body and your going to see physical changes. What ever happed to books? In the writing prompt topic it talks about how give us an ability to learn but that doesnt matter. We all need exercise to keep off going and keep us from out. Even if the computer gives us abilitys too. I think computers put to much importan us and its less with information. You have no clue what only one is putting on the internet so just make sure you be about it."	1904	
1905	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are important in many whays they help in education, communicating, and can be also used a entertainment. Computers are important with helping people learn. First computers help people right papers on there computer. In addition they aid in creating excel spread sheets and much more. My friend @PERSON3 has a computer and he can use it to research anything you can imagen and it takes a mater @ORGANIZATION1 seconds to find what you are looking for. But @PERSON3 isn't the only person that can do this, @ORGANIZATION3 presedent @PERSON1 says that there internet that they provid for people is @PERCENT2 used for resarch purposes. So would you rater have you children siting around or with there computer researching foright countrys and animals? On the outher hand computers don't need to just be used as a masive liybrary, it can also be use as a phone and you can talk to outher people from your computer and if you and the person you are talkig to have webcams then the two peopl can see each outher. My friend @PERSON2 and I were on our computers talking to each outher and it was free and unlike a phone we could both see each outher. The presededt @ORGANIZATION1 computers seds that @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 all computers are now being made with wed cams in turn for communication purposis. Would can rather pay @MONEY1 a month for a phone bill when you could be using your laptop computer for free? Computers can also be used as an entertainment divice. I can use my @ORGANIZATION2 laptop for playing movies and music and computer games on @CAPS2 or online. But I'm not the only person how dos this because @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people with computers uses them for entertainment. @PERSON1 the precedent @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION2 said that computers these days are being made to play movies on your computer beter than on your huge @MONEY1 inch plasma screen @CAPS3. So why would you spend @MONEY2 on a @MONEY1 inch @CAPS3 if you could just spend @MONEY3 on a desent laptop and whache @CAPS3 and moveis right on your laptop? Would you want your child to be the only one that cant resarch and cant talk to people and not be able to whach @CAPS3 without rasing the cadle bill?"	1905	
1906	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I also believe that computers have a positive effect on people, and here are my reasons why. It helps people learn new things, about the earth, animals, nature, and other things. Say your son or daughter doesn't know anything about the digestive system and they have to do a report for school. They can look it up on the computer and learn everything about it. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer and doesn't exercise or interact with their family. Well people can make a scheduele for computer time and time other things like exercising and spending time with family. It also gives kids something to do when they cant go outside. They can go on the computer, because I rather have a child go on the computer than them playing violent video games. It also helps people keep intouch with friends, because if your friend moved or one of your parents are on a buisness trip. You can use the computer to talk to them or see them on the webcam. Those are the reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people"	1906	
1907	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you know how badly the computers are effecting people? Computers are just a lazy way of keeping contact with people. The effects are spending more time on the computer than enjoying nature, less exercising, and interacting with family and friends. Now lets go on to enjoying nature than being on the computer all the time. Why don't you enjoy nature instead of being on the computer? Exploring nature is so much fun. Nature is a great way to meet new people and experience new stuff that you never seen before. You don't want to sit at a desk all day fooling around on the computer. It gets boring after being on the computer so long, but nature, you will never get bored. Enjoying nature is a great way to enjoy your life not wasting it on a computer. Since I wrote about nature, lets move on to exercising more. You don't want your body just sitting there on a chair all day long, @CAPS3 you? No, you want to exercise more with your body. All your doing is exercising your fingers, but why not use your whole body. Being on the computer is not going to help your body exercise at all. Go outside, and at least ride your bike a couple of miles. When you go exercising, you can at least get that blood flowing. Lastly, people should interact with your family and friends more often. Interacting with family and friends is more important than being on a computer. Keeping up with your family and friends is a very important thing because your family are the people that is closest to you and your future family. As us people know, friends come and go, but that is not a reason to have a couple of friends to hang out with. Some people might loose your family and friends by sitting at a computer all the time and not keeping in contact with them. Always interact with your family and friends. Spending too much time on a computer is a waste of time. It effects people by not enjoying nature, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. Now that you've heard my opinion, what @CAPS3 you think of it now?"	1907	
1908	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The creation of computers has greatly effected society. People are now connected to each other around the world. I believe this advancement in technology should be welcomed and embraced. Computers teach valuable skills including hand-eye cordination. People can reach information instantly. Lastly, the speed and quality of communication has increased ten fold. To start off, computers are great tools for learning. Young children learn hand-eye cordination by using the mouse while looking at the screen. Sometimes they learn this skill amazingly well. In the medical field, surgery is no longer done by hand, but with elaborate machines controlled by computers. @PERSON1, a @NUM1 year old student of @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION3, is studing to become a surgen. He is amazing with the computer system, not distancing many professional doctors with the new equipment. ""@CAPS1 is all because,"" scientist who have studied @PERSON1 say, ""he used computers sence he was little. This means he has an advanced sence of how they work and what to do when."" This prodigy was born because of computers.The talent of surgens greatly benefits society because better doctors means healthier people. Computers also benefit the information the internet. ""You have @NUM2 messages in your inbox,"" the window says as @CAPS1 pops onto my screen. I open my email, having not checked @CAPS1 for a day. @CAPS1 is filled to the with messages from @LOCATION4, telling me how far away my order is from my house I have an e-mail from @ORGANIZATION2, an article about the @CAPS2 rover. There is another e-mail from my orchestra teacher, reminding the class that the permission slip is due tommrow. All this would not be possible without computers. In a single second, I can know the headline news in @LOCATION6, or @LOCATION1. I can look at pictures from the @CAPS3 countryside, or a live feed from a submarine at the bottom of the ocean. The research for my social studies project was done in an hour with online rather than stay libray. The computer saves time. This means people have more time to exercise and enjoy nature when the monitor is turned off. Would you rather get in a dark, dark libray all day or enjoy the wonders of the world with a click of your hand, and still be in your own backyard to play outside? Also, people can acess data from around the world. Information on how to cook an @CAPS4 dish is available in @LOCATION5. Along with that, medical records are available every where, meaning all information can be combined to get a bigger picture of what your health issue maybe. Computers also improve the quality of comunication. Statistics show that in moder times, @PERCENT1 of meetings take place on a lap top, not in a board room. With video chatting, all of your partners can appear on a single screen sitting on your lap. You can answer and ask questions face to face from opposite sides of the world. This amazing feat would not be possible without computers. Instant messaging also allows for text to be transfer instantly over vast distances. Documents that would have otherwised been forced to send by mail appear at the speed of light in your inbox. This means instead of important documents taking weeks to appear, @CAPS1 takes seconds allowing the things that need to get done to be finished. Schools can take advantage of this by keeping digital copys of worksheets and other important documents insted of physal paper copies. This means less trees are killed. When trees are cut down, they no longer produce oxygen or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. With meetings taking place on a monitor, people no longer waste fossil fuels trying to get there, sence cars also produce carbon dioxide. Thus, using computers is better for the environment. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people say they prefer sending an email to sending a letter, due to the fact that letter costs money. Computers also alow for more interaction between people. If your father or mother is on a busness trip you can still say goodnight face to face. You can send an e-mail to your sister at college, who never answers her phone due to the time difference. Overall, computers make the world smaller, allowng for better means of communication. Computers are amazing peices of equipment, and I belive, they are a great benifit to society. They teach valuable skills, alow for fast and easy access to information and faster quality communication. Overall, the advancement of computers has benifited, and will benifit society greatly."	1908	
1909	1	"In my opinion I think computers are good to have and my three resons are that computers help people be able to learn about new things, talk to friends and family that live far away, and can help you find jobs and help you with your job. My first reason is that computers help people be able to learn about new thing like famos people and places which not many people really want to read a book to learn about when they get go online and see pictures and learn all they need to know about also you can learn new ways to prevent getting sick and how you can treat it @CAPS1 you already are. My second reson is that people can talk to friends and family that live far away because not many people always have time to grab a phone and call them but they do have time to email them. So computers can help keep you together with your frieds and family you rarely ever see. My third reson is that computers can help you find a job but @CAPS1 you already have one it can help you with it because lots of jobs these days use computers for lots of things like money for banks, for kids in school, stuff like that they can help you find a job by showing you different jobs that you can do or what you have to do to be able to do that job you have always wanted to do. In cunclusion I think computers are good and my three resons again are that computers help people learn about new thing, helps you stay togather with frieds and family that live far away, and help people find jobs but @CAPS1 they already have one computers help with the job."	1909	
1910	1	"Dear Newspaper, I'm sure you use computers a lot, typing up your articles. Many people in this world now use computers. There are people that work on computers sit on the @CAPS2 all day as their job. You can find so many things on the internet & @CAPS2 I think computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact, helps the environment and people, and helps remember things. First, computers now are very important and useful. There is always so many kinds of websites that you can meet you date or catch up with you family members. There is many people using facebook and myspace. Now you can instant message them to talk to them @CAPS1, you can find old friends or people in college. Secondly, some people might say oh, @CAPS8 you're on the @CAPS2 you have no social skills but you @CAPS6 you type and talk to people. You even improve your writing skills. @CAPS5, it helps with hand eye coordination. There are many people that has no hand eye coordination like me. When you look at the screen you have to move you hand to get the mouse where you want it. Computers @CAPS1 help you type faster @CAPS8 you type a lot you get practice, just talking to a friends you even improve. These are my reasons why I think computers help our society in interaction. Secondly, @CAPS2 now have everything you can think of from buying food at @CAPS3 & @CAPS4 to textbooks, all you have to @CAPS6 is search it on goodle and there it is. @CAPS8 more people use the textbooks online, than printing @NUM1 page books will @CAPS3. This means it will help the environment. People @CAPS3 cutting down trees because more people are using online books that means animals will keep their home. Secondly, you might think computers give radition, well more & more computers are trying to fix that, to help your heath so its not a danger to be on computers @CAPS5, @CAPS8 more people are buying and using computers they will need more jobs to help build them and sell them. Right now there are alot of people without jobs. So @CAPS8 you keep computers popular there will be a lor more jobs. These are my reason why computers are good for the environment % people. @CAPS5, people can remember things @CAPS8 they have really good memory. For me, I don't have good memory. And i know a lot of people that don't as well. Well that's where computers come handy. There is a button you press on mac computers and it pulls up a ""TO @CAPS6"" @CAPS7 and you can just type in whatever it will be there so you won't have to miss place the paper. Secondly, @CAPS8 you have a @NUM2 page essay you wrote on paper put it in your binder the holes can break and the paper is lot. Then when the teacher ask you where it is you have no clue, @CAPS8 you typed it you can go back in saved files and print it out. You have it. The good things is you get an A not a @CAPS9! @CAPS5, computers you can set something where it tells you every hour to @CAPS6 something. So while your on the @CAPS2 it will say one hour pasted and you can go @CAPS6 whatever you needed to @CAPS6 every hour these are my reason why computers help you remember things. As you can see, there is a lot of positive things when you buy a @CAPS2. There are many people that use computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact helps the environment & people and helps to remember things."	1910

1912	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that we benifit from computers. We do because computers can benefit society and benefit just regular people. Computers are a great way of comunication for people all over the world. But their not just for communication. Computers benefit society because they help the @LOCATION3, comunicate with places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 who both reasently had earthquakes and instead of a place to find out what they need, come back, get everything together, then going back to its to discover for @MONEY1 of people. We can just click a name and they can tell @LOCATION3 what they need. It also benefits society because the place could go undercover and actually talk to a criminal. He would be able to find out important things like where he lives, his name, people he is with and then they could go and arrest everyone. That has actually happened many times. Computers can also help regular people. Computers can help regular people because they can tell you @CAPS3 with regular updates instead of one in the papers. For example if the newspaper says light snow"". That is what I will prepare for. But what if it takes a turn for the worse; I want the storm hits and then it will be to late. but with the internet I can do @CAPS3.com and I'll know the @CAPS3 worse. Also I would use it to keep in touch with my cousins from so instead of paying @MONEY1 to go see them I can videochat or email them, for free. There are just some of the reason computers benefit everyone. Computers are great for so many reasons more than benefiting and regular people. Computers can be for any thing finding what means to helping @LOCATION2. Computers are amazing things."	1912	
1913	1	"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 the web, chatting with a friend @NUM1 miles away who you haven't seen in so long, or skyping with your dad while he is on a buisness trip. These are all terrific ways a computer can be used. Now imagine not being able to do any of these things. The computer is a wonderful advancement in technology! Many buisnesses today relie mostly on one. If we didn't have computers many people wouldn't have a job. I believe computers benefit society because they help you contact people. If you need them ergently, are a great pass time on a miserable winter day, and are a reliable sorce of information. To start off computers benefit society because they let you stay in contact with people miles away and contact them quickly if it is ergent. I mean imagine being in a whole other country for a few weeks where your phone doesn't work. If you have a computer you don't have to worry about spending a lot of money buying or using one. A @CAPS3. @PERSON2 from the local newspaper states; ""@PERCENT1 of travelers going on buisness trips bring a laptop, @PERCENT2 of travelers going to another countrey for anything bring their laptop."" This shows that without computers contacting people would be @NUM2 times harder. Additionally, having computers in todays day and age is beneficial to our society because when it is winter and it is way to cold out to think of stepping out the door a computer can be a great pass time. To catch up with friends and family, to organize up coming events, or to just play a game. Even when your sick a computer can be fun. When you are sick you are required to stay in bed. What else would you do other than watch t.v. or go on your computer? As @PERSON1 @CAPS4 in the daily current; ""In the winter computers are used @NUM3 times more."" This concludes that having a computer is a great pass time. Finally, having computers is benifitial to our society because they are a reliable sorce of information. When you are doing homework, or research for your job, computers can save you time and money. Instead of taking ten to twenty minutes in your day and driving @NUM4 miles to a library or your office. You could be saving money on gas and valuable time in your day. Instead you can just log on to your computer and look it up on google. This takes about two to five minutes. As @CAPS3. Gizmo states; ""The average @CAPS6 can save over @MONEY1 a year by using a computer instead of a car. This is why having a computer is benifitial to the society. In conclution computers are very helpful on a day to day basis. Whether you are contacting a friend or family member, or it's to cold to go outside and you are bored, or you need information in a short amount of time, computers can help with many things. Thank you for taking time out to read this. I hope you take it into consideration."	1913	
1914	1	"@ORGANIZATION1. I believe that computers are a good thing. They are good because they help you in school. They also can help organized and last you can use laptops go places. I know that I use a computer in school everyday. I use this for research on people I dont know like @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @LOCATION1. This brings me to my next point. I also use it for papers I will need to type my paper. This will enable me to write and then save all my work. Not only can the do that but also can keep your paper neat. I don'@CAPS1 have good hand writing so I type my paper. This keeps my work neat. I love computers because they keep you organized. I can have all my work from @NUM1 years ago on a hard drive so I am organized. Also I only have @NUM2 file so I need to have all this stuff in my binder @CAPS2! I just save it on my file. You can also stay organized by using with to transfor things to a diffrent computr or laptop. This will definetly keep me organized. I am horrified that people don'@CAPS1 like computers. You get so much use out @ORGANIZATION1 that like with laptops you can take them with you anywhere. I went to @LOCATION2 and took my laptop and I worked on my schools paper. It helped a lot. They also let you talk to friends and family that you cant usually talk to because you don'@CAPS1 live close. So you can keep in touch with them. I hope that now people love desktops and laptops just a much as I do. Because they help with school staying organized and they have different varietiys and they are on the go. So please keep computer alive."	1914	
1915	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: In my opinion, computers have a negative effect on most people. I think this because the internet can give false information; staring at a computer screen all day can cause eye damage; and a person who sits in front of a computer all day can become fat and unhealthy. Continue reading for more details on the opinion... My first reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because the internet can give false information. For example, if you type in ""dogs"" into a search box on @ORGANIZATION1, you can get results about cats. Did you know that anybody in the world (who owns a computer) can go onto the internet and make a website and false information? Twenty-five precent of internet websites that were meant for learning distribute false information. My next reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because it could cause eye damage. Studys show that if you sit in front of a computer all day that your ability to see will decrease, little by by little. It's only a matter of time before your eyesight is either poor or completely gone. Another study showsthat @PERCENT1 of teenagers are ""addicted"" to playing video games or being on the computers all day. That's @PERCENT1 of our future generation who will probably not be able to see very well or at all by the time they're @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old. Is that the kind of future you want? My third and final reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because a person can become fat and unhealthy. These people could chow down on a bag of chips, which have thousands of calories, and not exercise or anything to exort all these calories. Those stored calories will build up and turn into fat cells, and clog arteries and veins and cause massive heart attacks and strokes. In conclusion, there is an extremely negative affect on sitting in front of computer all day for the following reasons: the internet could give you false information; it could decrease eye sight and; these people could become fat and unhealthy. Please take my opinion into consideration."	1915	
1916	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I thank that a lot of people uses the computer everyday. For me, I spend a bit of time on the cumputer as somedays. I do sprite comily, write staring, and check information on the internet, and I some times chat with my friends.I enjoy a lot. its in @DATE1 that I go around connec ticut to find the things in nature, like survival. I made a few hunting bows and arrows for me when I can go around the world and survive the elements with some help frum . For studies at home I use the computer for research whether . There really powerful and collect a lot of jewery in rush time. When they wrer extinct they still were cool. In other researches I found a few things fun some health benefits. Theres always some good things fun computers like improving hand eye coordination, music, arts, etc, everytime they use the computers there fingers start getting faster evrytime. Well my last reason and answer is that I agree that using computers is good for something and bad for your hand and eye sight."	1916	
1917	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you agree that computers benefit your society? Those who support advances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. Instead of being in side on the computer allday you can get some exercise. You can go for a walk. You can go have a social life and hangout with you friends. Would you agree that being on the computer benefits society? Instead of being in the house on the computer all day you can go to the gym. Going to the gym can help you stay healthy. It can also help you stay in shape then you might be able to fit into that stress you bought that was two tight. Also, you might meet a nice man at the gym. So instead of bing on facebook or aim all day get up and go to the gym. Maybe you should go for a walk rather than sit on the computer. Sitting on the computer will just make you fat. Going for a walk daily will make you skinney and healthy. Also, going for a walk daily will help strengthen your bones and mucsles in your legs. Try going for a walk daily instead of sitting on the computer and eating chips all day. Get a life, don't sit on the computer all day. Go have a lunch date with your friends. You might want to take walk with your friend. Have fun going out with your friends. You might want to the bowling alley. So have fun and get a life. So now @CAPS4 you think computers benefit your society? Those who support advances in technology blieve that computers have a positive effect on people. So go the gym make your body be wanted. Take your dog for a walk and watch how it helps your bones and muscles stronger. Get a life go @CAPS4 something with your friends and have a fun time."	1917	
1918	1	"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever asked yourself if computers benfit our society? Think about it, everybody uses a computer atleast one hour a day some people are on the computer all day and night. We all rellay so much on computers that if we stop using computers we might not be able to function. We use computers to communicate, store information, keep track of information, tracking shipments, running bisness. Computers are a tool they can help you but they can hurt you to if you are to dependent on computers. You have to be careful how much you rellay on the computers. Also there are criminals who use the computers to hurt you so you have to be careful about what information you put the computer. In conclusion, computers can help and harm you for many defferent reasons. That is why I belive that we shouldn't rellay so much on the computer that we can't function without them. That is why we can't rellay so much on computers."	1918	
1919	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Are computers helping or hurting? When most people gaze at a lit-up computer screen, they are most likely alone, not excercising, or showing any individual personality. Soon if we continue focusing @CAPS4 time on computers. We will be disconnected from friends, rather that connecting, like those social networks do. Computers are a individual pastime. Multiple people are not ""tweeting"" off of the same computer together. Therefore, you @MONTH1 be talking through electronics to them, but you lack face-to-face experiences. A research was done by @PERSON1, at @LOCATION1, that states @PERCENT1 of children born in the @DATE1 to present will be socialy incapeable by their late @NUM1 due to ""isolation socialization"". We don't want to lose the abilit to connect with the closest to us. Consequently, if we are not experiencing face-to-face talks - there is no personality needed to carry a conversation. Uniqueness is what we're all about! my sister married a hardworking @CAPS1. @NUM2 years ago coming up on their sixth anniversary, their marriage isn't going so well. Last year @CAPS3 recently got a @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 can't stay off it. In the words of my sister- ""@CAPS3 doesn't engage in family moments anymore, and has become a ""robot"". I am starting to fear @CAPS3 won't be a good father for @CAPS4 @NUM3 mont baby on the way. @CAPS3 just never gets off the computer."" @CAPS4 personality change could hurt the ones around us. Techknowledgy is advanced bu that advanced. We are not able to search the web while running or playing a sport. We have to opt out of excercise to do the things your body wants to do. The only body parts moving in typing are your fingers and your hands. That just doesn't cut it. Soon well be the fat, lazy. Space ment women from @CAPS5-@CAPS6 the movie. They just float around in chairs videochating with people and doing other things on their tus/computers. They don't leave their chair once to stop their activity. Therefore they have forgotten how to walk. To answer you questions, computers are hurting us. They are blackholes that suck the personality out of us, and isolate us. We are equivalent to lifeless blobs of accumiliating, fat, when hypmotize by a computer."	1919	
1920	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect(s) computers have on people is that computers can have both a negative and positive effect. From @CAPS1 opinion I lean more towards negative even though I do enjoy computers. @CAPS1 reasons for why I lean more towards negative is because it's a waste of time, you could get put into very dangerous situations, and not thinking properly. @CAPS1 first reason why I think computers are a negative effect on people is because it's a waste of time. Instead of using your time wisely with activities you could or should do your on the computer. You should be writing your five page essay but instead your on facebook or playing an online game. When your on the computer is distrants you from work you must be doing, which is important and will just be a mess later on. This is a situation I can also relate to. I suppose to be writing a paper for english class but instead I was playing on the computer and wasted over an hour and could've just got @CAPS1 paper done with. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because you could get put into very dangerous situations. Some people think chat rooms are fun and nothing bad could ever happen but chat rooms are very dangerous. Thousands of online predators try talking to kids younger and meet them in person, which is extremely dangerous. Many people out there try to harm other humans emotionally and physically. So you never want to try talking to strangers in any way because it can lead you into a bad situation down the road. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it takes away your energy and you don't think properly when on the computer you tune out everything around you and not pay as close attention to things like you should. Even though computers can be fun you should take a break and do something even more useful such as a physical activity. Computers can distract you from doing physical work your body needs which leads to lazyness. Lazyness is not healthy for your body and can cause you to a health related problem and you @MONTH1 need medical attention. So as you see computers can be very negative towards people and cause many problems. I hope you keep in mind what I have written."	1920	
1921	1	"Dear To who this @MONTH1 consirn, Computers… They are great for when it comes to projects, papers, and fun. I think that computers have a sum what good effect on people because up untill a few years ago most people didn't even know how to use a computer. Now a days computers help people in many ways, they help with reports and projects. Computer keep getting better and better as the years go by. Now they have edvanced enternet, and have even added a new edvanced microsoft word, you can do powerpoints, brosures, and even invitations. Computers had had a great effect on people because some people have children that they have to take care of all day or when they get home from work. The computer can help entertain children. Children can go and play games, watch moves or depending on their age even connect with friends. One of the features of the computer has made a big effect on people is the webcam. The webcam has helped people connect with old friend, distint relitives, or eyed a child thats off at school. As you can see computers had effected people in many ways. But one other reason is work. Some people work from home so they can be a stay at home parent or even take care of someone close. Either way they stay connected with, emplyies, they boss, or even clients. People take alot of vacations, but they also work, so they just bring their laptop with them and their ready to go. So as you can see computers had effected peoples lifes in big ways, weather its work, entertaing kids, or just having fun. The computer is a big help to every person."	1921	
1922	1	"Do you spend a lot of time on computers? Well, if so I have a suggestion to you. Limit yourself to computer time! If you don't limit yourself and stay on the computer all the time, then you will miss out on better things in life. You still don't get why I am suggesting this. Then here are some examples why. One example of why you should limit your time with computers is because you will goin weight @CAPS6 likely. College @CAPS1 from @ORGANIZATION1 observes that @PERCENT1 of people who spend a majority of their time on computers gain weight because if all you do is eat sleep and go on the computer, what exercise are you getting in that life style. This is a perfect example of why you should limit your time in computers. Aniother reason why you should limit your time on computers is that you are risking your chance of losing your friend or friends. What I mean by this is that if you have your mind get on the computer you will start to choose it our your friends and site, of what is important to you. Your friend @MONTH1 even not want to be friend any more because they are sick of being chosen over by a computer. @CAPS4 @CAPS2, creator of the computer says, ""@CAPS3 I make the computer, I was , and time my friend would call to get a drink, with me I always told him I was busy on the computer. He eventually didn't to and with I becoming obsessed the computer. ""That is know @CAPS4 @CAPS2 his : from . If you don't want to loose , your computer . My limit yopur time is because your grades will drop. pricipal , @CAPS6 of their on computers once of their because @CAPS3 student have from school, they straight the computer @CAPS3 they should be doing their homework or studying."	1922	
1923	1	"Dear newspaper editor, I've been hearing alot of discussion about the computer issues. In my own opinion I feel that computers are a great thing to learn about and can really benefit from computers helps you find information alot quicker, lets you talk to family/ friends far away and also helps with alot of school assignments. People always talk about how they want to travel the world and see/visit different places well if people really wanted to find quick and easy information about that particular place. It's way easier expecally because about every house in the @CAPS1.S has a computer so many things go by faster. For exmaple say that you wanted to find some information about birds, not every person has a book about birds and time to go to the library and if you had a computer all you would have to do was look it up and have your questions answered. Alot of people are moving and when I say moving I mean far away. Alot of people wonder haw they would keep i'll touch with there family? They can write letters but it would take way to long. They could buy plan tickets to visit, but right now in this recetion nobody really has enough money to pay for it. So what's a cheaper way to talk to your family and see them as well? Webcam webcam is an easy way to talk to family and friends easally and now every labtop made has one and it is very easy to connect. It's when you able to see them and talk to them at the same time as long as you event for as long as you want. In the @DATE1 technology has grown rapidly. More technology has been put into schools, homes and even building. More school cure starting to give alot of assignments with computers needs. I've been seeing that alot of teachers have been giving us alot of writing assignments with us having to research alot of things. Also that we have to type alot of papers. They are making computers a big part of education now and making technology take part in it too. Ifee it is a good combination. To some up up my easy I do feel that computers has a big benefit to society and helps us solve alot of issues. As the years go on not just computers but alot of other electronics will be very normal to human life."	1923	
1924	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers don’t have a negative effect on people. The computer can teach you about @CAPS4 things easier, and it allows you to talk to people @CAPS2, people can be on when they use the computer or not. On the computer, you can learn about anything. For example, there are @CAPS4 websites that allow you to search any topic and you will get a lot of information on that topic. @CAPS2, there are websites, such as @LOCATION1, where you can find the definition f words fast and easy. It takes along time to search through dictionary, but with this websites, you can do it much faster. @CAPS3 say that you want to buy a car, but you want to learn more about this can to make sure its the right choice. Well, with a computer you can do that I are let you learn about cars with video and more. There is no way that is a back affect @CAPS3 say you want to talk to somebody but someone else is on the phone. Computer you can go on the internet @CAPS4 sites let you chat will you find. This can be goal because a like here could happen. Its @CAPS2 guide when because @CAPS5 like to reply. People let do They said that computers have a effect on because they werent got they outside but what they use the computer. They will get bored of the computer at some point. At sometime they will run out oxf stuff to learn. Then they will go out and do activities get exercise and spend time will family and friends. I for one, do that too. When I get home from school I do my home work computer. On the computer I check a few things and then get off. After that I go and @CAPS6 you see, people know when to get off the computer and get excercise. Computers don't here a negative effect on More like they help people. They teach us stuff, helps get who quickly are talk to friends faster. everthing that a computer does is positive."	1924	
1925	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have herd about a problem of computer usage. Also some benefits with the computer. But I believe that computers shouldn't be stoped being used. They help you in homework, directions, and stores which helps you a lot. First in homework you can use the computer for typing on essay. And if your not a good speller, you have the spell cheaker on microsoft office to help you. So that you dont get a @CAPS1- from all and your spelling mistakes. When you would of had a @CAPS2+ on it. A computer also helps you with homework by helping you see what was for homeworks for tonight if you forgot to wright it down or if you were sick. I now you could call a friend, but what if your friend was in a different core. So all you have to do is go onto your school website and go to the teacher's site and see whats the homework. Also a computer helps you with directions. It helps you by starting at your house to you exact locashion. So if your new to the city/suberb you don't find yourself lost, and don't know how to get back home. You just need to go to internet, then to google map and type in your house and destanashion. It shows you the rout and you can print out the directions to have it with you. And on the map it has on the side how many miles on what street/rout you need to go. So you don't have to guess. But I know there are @CAPS3's. But I don't like them. Once my uncle go a @CAPS3 an wanted to try it out when he came over to my house while he was driving. He new how to get here but, when he got on my streeet he said that the @CAPS3 folled him that he was in the woods, and didn't show a street. So thats why I stop to using computer with my directions. Lastly a computer helps you with stores. With a computer you can go to a stores website and look at what they have for close or sales etc. So you done find your self on a @NUM1 hr hunt for a toy or pair of boots when it should only take @NUM2 min. Also a computer can help you with resturant raitings. By going to the resterounts websit you can see reviews and raitings and prices of their food, and opinnions on the resturaunt. So that you don't find yourself with bad. One time I was at a resteraunt for lunch with my family. And everyone got there order except my brother @PERSON1. And the wator said it will be here soon. @NUM3 mins later he got his burger. I know thats enough time to make a burger from scrach. So they tecnicly forgot my brothers order. And we didn't give a big tip. Computers arn't bad for people. They can help you a lot. They can help with typing for homework, directions to a store and stores sales. So computers are helpfull throughout our daily lives."	1925	
1926	1	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 think that computers are fun, exciting, and the way of the future, it's not! I mean come on you can never go wrong with shopping online. That's how I felt until I got taste of my own medicine, my friend ignored me to be on the computer, and it hurt, so i decided to take a look at how it's changed everyone. Parent's and children of all age's, how many time's have you gone online and little match making pop-up appears on you screen? have you ever just to just to see who you'll if so then the parents who are reading my letter, talk to your children about the dangers of online match making. There are lots and lots or perverted adults waiting to find senceless kids to minipulate or ""chat"" with. Now children, teens, and young adults is not a making way from that in a while and visualize the @CAPS2 healthy, stay action stay away from the computer, just remember, there's always testing!"	1926	
1927	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a bad feeling about computers? Well I @CAPS1. Over the years I've seen computers ruin peoples health and lower students grades at school. People truly would be better off with out computers. Taking walks, or going for a run, are all activitys which will keep you fit. But sitting down at a computer is not. My older brother @CAPS2 would always stay on the computer playing games on the internet for hours at a time. As days, weeks, then months went on our family began to notice alot of wait gain on him. As he began to spend less time on the internet and more time exersising he losed some weight so that @CAPS2 was health again. I've also noticed that its more tempting to eat a bag of chips then to eat a carrot while on the computer. It takes a while to prepare health food then it is with unhealthy foods. Over a peird of time all the junk food you've been eating with harm your health. Last year my friends father had a heart attach because be had too much fat blocking his heart. If he were eating good food such as carrots, chicken, and tomatos his heart attack could have been prevented. That is why my friends farther spends less time on the internet, giving him more time for health food you would never stare into a light both for hours so why would you look into a computer for that long? Dr. @PERSON1 from @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" my studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 waring glass, eyes, have been harmed be common things like your television, and computer. I wont to live a long healthy life and will not let computer's stop me. The internet can be an important object in your adulecents life, but it can also be the most dangers. Over the years there has been about @NUM1 kidnapping in @LOCATION2 each year. My cusin @PERSON2 found a person on my space who said he was fifteen. He even had a picture of his young self on the computer. It turns out he was now forty years old. I'm not saying not going on the computer will stop you from metting these kind of people but it will precent your children from it. Not only that but computer effect your sleep. When I was in @NUM2 grade I spent hours on the computer. At school I was tierd and found it diffcult to learn. Suprisingly I wasnt the only one have trouble sleeping. A person named mike found it difficult to sleep because he always wanted to be on the internet when he wasnt on. When we both notice the internet was causing my grades to go down and harming mikes sleep. We decided not to go on any longer and tell no adult about mikes sleeping problems. With out computers the world would not be perfect but it would be a better place. I hope that you will not let computers harm you and your family. Please keep my letter and consider my idea."	1927	
1929	1	I think computer's are good to use. The first reason why I think is good because if we did not have any computer's we could'nt go on @CAPS1 and all types of fun stuff I think life would be kinda boring. My second reason is life would be boring without computers is because we cound'nt comuncaite with our friends or family wat if we did not have cell phones how would we talk to them so I think we should have computer's. The next reason is what if we has to do a school project and we needed a computer wit h internet what could we do have to write it by hand so at some point I think computer are good to work with like if we needed to find out how to get some place we would need a computer or a gips either one. In conclusion so I think we need computers to do fun stuaff to help us if we needed to find out how to get somewear or do something fun like play games go on @CAPS1 and all that kninda stuff. That's why I think we need computer's the end.	1929	
1930	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the idea to let people use computers is a good idea. This is because @CAPS1 can help with any school subjects, @CAPS1 can keep you keep in touch with family and friends, and you can even look up and places/destinations. Therefore, I think the effects computers have on people are good. The first reason why I think computers are great for people is because @CAPS1 can help both adults, teenagers and kids with school/education. Computers have a good effect on teenagers because if there was any reason why a teenager wouldn't be allowed to attend college classes they would have another opportunity to take them online. The compuetr helpd adults with college also, if they were to go deal wtih computers whether they worked in an office, or even from home. The computer can also help teenagers and kids because they, or their parents, would be able to look up their homework, or vene if they missed work in school because they were absnet, they would be able to chech that up. In the end, computers are a good effect on people because @CAPS1 can help them with their schooling and education. Another reason why @CAPS1 hink computers are good effect on people is because they can help friends and family stay in touch. Now-a-days were are social networking sites such as facebook, and @CAPS4 where peole can stay iun touch. If nay person had a family member of friend that lived out o f the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that person would be close to email them and even video chat wiht them. Otherwise, you can them on facebook and you would be bale to look at pictures of them or even send them messages to keep in touch. Teenagers like to also video and on to keep in touch with each other or even like to I.M each other on @CAPS4. A reason why adults can use the computer is because if they were to use a website the use the computer to stay in touch with that person. Therefore, the computer not only could be used for schooling and education, @CAPS1 can also be used for people to stay in touch with one another. The last reason why I think computer are a good effect on peole is beacuse they would be able to lok up places. People sometimes like to look up places where they will be travelling to; so they can find out more about that place. For example like the people, the economy, the money they use etc. You would also be able to look up pictures of how that play looks whether @CAPS1 looked beautiful and different than any other place you're seen or if @CAPS1 looked casual like any other place. For example when my family and I had gone to the @LOCATION1 over break mu parents would constantly look @CAPS1 up online to find out information and to see what @CAPS1 looked like. However, not only can you use the computer to find out information of a place or pictures, you can also find an address of @CAPS1. Therefore, being able to use the computer can help a person find out any inforamtion about any place. Overall, I think computers have a great efefct on people because @CAPS1 could help them with school or any education, @CAPS1 could help people stay in touch with family and friends, and lstly, peopel would be bale to look any up any information or any kind of place.

1931	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 is spending a lot of time on computers. They don’t spend time doing other things like exercising. Spend time with your family and enjoying life. You should spent less time on the computers and more time with your family because if your on the computer all day your family going to think your at bthe family anymore because you never be around. And you dont want that to happend thats why you should spend a little more less time on the computer and more time with your family. Another reason is if you keep on getting on the computer and play games it could get you stupid you should enjoy your life and do something postive with your self instead of getting on the computer all day. If you do that, that mean you have no life. My last reason is you shoud go to the gym and go exercise instead get on the computer. I said that because is on the computer you could get fat, and you be so into the you dont even wanna cook your In conclusion thats what you should do all said and because sometimes stuff like that could get you dumb."	1931	
1932	1	"@PERSON1 ~~~~@CAPS1: @NUM1 @CAPS2: @NUM2 The computers always have had a good affect on people. This is so because they are able to help people in there time of need with the online doctors you can book youâ€™re appoint. This is so much than getting stuck on hold. Next the computers are a great way to meet people after you talk to them you can get to gather and have a great time with your new best friend. On the other hand there are many people online want to hurt you in more ways than one. Another good reason is computer video games. I love these types of games like all teens do. Also this makes a great way to make friends you can play to gather. This dose take away time out side but you can by inside booking a camping trip also you can book a @DATE1 get way this is perfect to get out of work or just call in sick and off you go. I hope this has helped you see that there are manly good things from a computer."	1932	
1933	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the rise of computers effect on teens, adults and children is good. For adults, having a computer is useful for work, and communication. For teens, it is useful for schoolworks, communication and fun. For young children it is useful for fun and learning. I remember when I was younger I of educational games on my computer. I especially enjoyed with, and now for the seven years I have been taking with classes a grade above. This shows the effect a computer could have on a childs education. Also, for teens, having a computer could help them research something for a report. With this research, their project would valid. Also, if somebody forgot what their homeworks was the could ask their friend via @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. This is why computers help with schoolwork. This ties into my next reason, communication. If I forgot my homework I could easily just and a friend to email it to me or past it on @CAPS1. Without computers, there would be no way to get lost of forgotten homework. Also, a computer is a good way to communicate with friends. ""@CAPS3 to my friends @CAPS1 sometimes I'll end up hanging and with that person says local @PERSON1. A recent poll found that @PERCENT1 of all middle school students have a computer with service in their house. Students would benefit from having computers. Friends would benefit also and so would adults. This is another reason why people should use computers. Don't you think that after a long day of school, just want to relax and. Well, for fun computer a play video games. such as and people to play. Over @NUM1 on the internet, and kids would like to play than @NUM2 students said that they play games on the internet and enjoy it. Also fantasy baseball and basketball etc. are great ways for people to learn to manage a learn about players, and have fun. Without the use of computers, following a sports than would be very difficult. This is one last reason why having a computer is a good thing. In conclusion, computer are good because of the educational value, communication, and fun. What do you think? Do you want to take away all these opportunities from people or all ages? If not, we a computer."	1933	
1934	1	"Imagine a world without computers. What would it be like? For one thing, taking attendance in schools would be much harder than it is right now. It would be much harder and less efficient to take attendance on paper and there would be a much greater likelihood for error. Computers pros out weigh their cons by a long shot, because they simplify everything an make it much more user friendly, they drive almost every man-made thing in the world, and they will reduce the amount of paper we as humans use to make books and other materials. What would having to spend hours looking through dozens of books just to find one little peice of information feel like? Certainly not many kids in todays world would know, given that over @NUM1 of the worlds books are already digitized and you can access them all with just a little click on a keyboard. Most teachers and school administrators do not seem to understand that a little thing called wikepedia is a lot more efficient less time-consuming and a lot less tedious than looking through books. Computers are a great source of information for getting what you want when you want it. You can even search the simplest things, such as the temperature and the humidity. Businesses use microsoft, xcel to graph data, and most of our money is not in dollar bills it is in cyberspace, not even real. As you can see computers really can simplify and make everything a whole easier. My second reason that computers can have and do have a positive effect. On people is because virtually every man-made thing today has a computers of same sort in the cars have computers that automatically call @NUM2 if you get into an accident. Some newer guns, such as the cornershot have computers on them. Even @NUM3 childrens toys that you buy on the streets have computers. Imagine what would happen to @LOCATION1 if its grid network failed. Because all of its traffic lights sewer systems and especially the stock worksheet all run on computers, or in some cases one single computers if they failed their would be mass hysterio. Some people would lose everything they had, and everyone taking the metro or subway would be trapped where they were. Life would be hell without computers. Third, computers reduce the amount of paper used to make books and other materials. Schools alone waste over half of the @LOCATION2's paper supply so the tree hugging should be jabbling at the schools instead of major corporations. Most of todays books and other forms of literature are already digitized."	1934	
1935	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 town times, @CAPS2 the computer can be very beneficial to the people of our town. It helps us to communicate with one another. From what I understand some experts from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 The Society say that people are not going outside to exercise and are becoming obesie. I understand that this can be a problem but htere are many other reasons why @CAPS2 the computer is a benefit for everyone such as, researching for many projects and work related things, having the ability to comunicate with friends, and the fact that we can learn about so many subjects as the tips of out fingers. Furthermore let me tell you more about why computers are so useful. In a recent study at @ORGANIZATION1 done by the Computers of the @ORGANIZATION2. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 freshman through sophmore students and if they did not have computer, most of their projects for @ORGANIZATION1 would not @CAPS4 as good of a grade as they did. But of all of these students @PERCENT1 of them used @ORGANIZATION3 search engine to @CAPS4 their info. For example, @PERSON1 was asigned a project that called for her to use her computer and nothing else. On that project she recieved an A+ because she knew where to last for what she maded to find. Clearly almost all students know how to @CAPS4 good, factual info and explain it in their work. To say they dont go outside enough might be true but how else would they @CAPS4 a good grade. In addiction to what I have just explained to you I would now like to talk about second networking, @CAPS5. @PERSON2 recently talked on his show about how networking such as @CAPS6 @CAPS7 an @CAPS8 have made teen lives totally different. "" They can know become closer to friends just by the click of a mouse"", says @PERSON2. Not only is he right but, if teens were not on tthe computer as much, they might not have as many friends. Also, moms and dads are mostly working and are not. able to drive their kids to their friends house as these networking sites are how kids most communicating. Futhermore, In a recent statistic state by the international @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @PERCENT2 of all teenagers found out the news from the internet. From my own personal experiences I found out about the earthquakes in @LOCATION2 by looking at recent photographs taken. Now I that kids should take more time out of their shcedules to go outside and play with friends but going on the computer is a way of us relaying and to catch up with what is happening in our society. If we had nowhere to relax then we would probably have to watch alot more of the news and we all know working television does not help you in the long run. From the facts stasted above, surely going on the computer is resourseful and could be used often because it help kids @CAPS4 excellent grades on, projects having the ability to use social networks, and the will catch you up with the news I know that computers and one of the use resources and know you do too."	1935	
1936	1	"It has been said that people are the computer alot nowadays, but who said that was a bad thing? It's a great way to stay connected with anywhere. It also teaches a lot and about anything. Finally all the skills you get from a computer can help you get into a good school or get a good job. So hopefully you will see how this can be a good thing. Having a computer is a great way to talk to people without jackin up the phone bill. You can talk to your friends or family no matter where they are even in a forign country. You can email them or even talk to them on a chat so like they're fight there. You can even video video chat is a great even for doing a business or having a family get together. Thats one why using the computer is not a bad thing. You can learn anything you need to know on the computer. You how to speak a different language and learn about their countrys. Instead of your time looking information about something you can for it. Many people think that a good education you have to go college. is not always the. in the future. So as you have read the internet can people successfull in life. Now I hope you see how people using the computer more can actually benefit them. It's a great communication device, teaches people a lot and can help people get into good colleges and get good jobs."	1936	
1937	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 times, @CAPS3 @CAPS4! As these words flash across your television you go straight to your @ORGANIZATION1 to find the scoop. About what just happened. While your finding information you tap away @CAPS5 the keys like there's no tommorrow. And before you know @CAPS5 you've finished your article for tommorrows newspaper. Without computers you would only have the manimal details @ORGANIZATION1 the stories about countries half way found the world. To begin, if computers were not helpful and important would schools teach children how to use and create projects with them? According to @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1 technology, ""Computers are important to our youth and not only do they enjoy using them, but @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 young adults study more efficiently while using a @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS5 school we use computers for everything I can't tell you how many papers I have typed on the @ORGANIZATION1 in my @NUM1 years @ORGANIZATION1 schooling I know that computers help dozens @ORGANIZATION1 kids study too. The social studies book that my class uses has an online textbook with many study tools and resources to use and I score @CAPS5 least @NUM4 points better on tests and quizzes when I use those resources. Which brings me to my next point, computers are fun to use to chat with friends. Social networking sites like @CAPS6, @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 messaging are helpful when contacting friends about homework, meeting up or even having just a friendly conversation. Experts who say ""People are spending to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends"" are contradicting themselves beacuse people every where interact online with their long distance family and friends whether would have no way @ORGANIZATION1 contacting otherwise and make plans with their other family and friends. Finally, in fifth and sixth grade the students in my district had to take a @ORGANIZATION1 class that taught hand-eye coordination and fast reacting time which can be helpful outside @ORGANIZATION1 school and in sports, computers teach and can even sometimes teach better than teachers can. My cousin takes online courses for school so without computers she would not be learning as much. Computers are important to society in this day and age whether that be getting info on world @CAPS4, contacting friends and family or learning new and important subjects."	1937	
1938	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. I believe this because of @NUM1 reasons. One, kids can use the computer to do homework. Two, adults and kids can use the computer to view news and what's going on. Lastly, it gives people the ability to talk with others through the web. These are my @NUM1 reasons why I think computers have a positive effect ohn people. Reason one why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives kids the ability to do their homework faster and with more acurate information. According to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 rush through their homework and just write down random answers. If a computer was avalible not only will they be getting it done in the same time but the answers would be correct and they would be learning. All because of these being a computer handy kids can now do good in school and still enjoy the outside and other activities they love doing. This is one reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Reason two why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives them the access to view the news and what is going on in their area. Some people end up late to work because they didn't know that there was a wreck on the road and it took a while to take care of. I'm pretty sure their boss wasn't to happy when he or she came in late. But if a computer was handy the person could of looked online and saw that and could of found an alternate route to get to work. This is another reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. My last reason why I think computers have a positie effect on people is because it gives people access to chat with people online. Now a days they have college online which is a good idea. Without a computer people can't use or even look into oppertunities like that. In ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2"" it states that @PERCENT2 of people don't attend college. With a computer people can go to college right from their house. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. By reading this essay I hope that I have persuded you that computers have a positive effect on people for three reasons. It allows kids to do homework, give people access to news, and allows online chatting. I hope you take my letter into consideration of how computers do have a positive effect on people. Thank you."	1938	
1939	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers comsume many hours of what could have been productive time everyday. Although the internet is a great way to stay updated witj current events, it is also very dangerous. Computers lead to cyber bullying weight gain and drapped gradesi which is why I feel they have a negative effect on citizens around the world. As you know teens across @LOCATION1 spend countless hours instant messaging, going on @CAPS8 or @CAPS2, and uploading pictures that anyone can see. However, a good praction of the teen experience the torture of cyber bullying. Children are very much emotional we are still trying to understand the world. With new pressure, the bst thing we need is more drama. However, Computers lead to @CAPS10. This is where a victim is teased or harrassed by someone online. Sometimes, you @MONTH1 not know who this person is. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the teenagers who were cyberbullied are depressed or commit suicide. It is hard enough to be a teen, bit computers just add more stress; and somtimes ends lives. Obesity is a growing problem in @LOCATION1. Adding on the distraction of television, @CAPS3 everywhere are losing excersize. I have realized that ever since I received my own laptop, I have spent less time excersizing and more time eating. Not only are computers time sonsuming but also lead to drama. as more drame occurs usually eat more. Computers have a large effect on weight gain mostly because of the @CAPS4 for fastfood restaurants. Everywhere you look you could find flashing ads about @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6. This os encouraing unhealthy eating all around our country but the world. Computers effect the everyday health of humans. Ever wonder why your child is failing school? It could be because they spend too much time on the computer. Internet serves as a distraction all over the world erasing the thought of having to do homework. The more time teens spend on the computers they grow tired and forget about their nightly assignment. Not completing homework for a certain amount of time could lead to dropped grades. Not only does internet effect dropped grades but online games do too! websites suck as addictinggames.com are time consuming. They talk away time that could have been spent doing homework. Also, with the drama that takes place on @CAPS7 or @CAPS8 @CAPS3 might not be able to concentrate on school work out at all. Computers serve as distractions that lead to low grades. I hope you have come to find the dramatic effects computers have on humans. In one day @CAPS9 lose countless hours of precious time just because of a machine. Computers lead to @CAPS10 weightgain, and dropped grades. No wonder @CAPS9 are so stressed! Therefore, I believe computers have a negative effect on people around the world. Thank you for your time!"	1939	
1940	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Technology is a big part of our lives in the twenty-first century. Everybody has a cell phone, iPod, and computer. It really makes you wonder if advance in technology are really a good thing. I believe that the effects computers have on people are very good. Computers give us thousands of answers, allow us to enjoy entertainment, and even talk to online friends and chat. Computers are great! Computers are a way to find information about thousands of topics. Have you ever wanted to travel to @LOCATION1? If you jut typed in @LOCATION1' into the search box, millions of websites would pop up in a matter of seconds. If you need directions to the nearest pizza restaraunt, you can just look it up and you will find it. Finally if you need to find a definition to a word in your novel, you can go on to the online dictionary and figure out what it means. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how computers are a great way to find useful information about a variety of topics? Well, computers alos allow us to be very entertained too! Computers allow people to pretty much do whatever they want. They have all sorts of websites that are very entertaining. On computers, you can play hundreds of really fun games. You can choose your ability, level, and @CAPS4 even your character. You can play against people @CAPS4 and it is very fun. Computers can also allow you to read articles about whatever you are interested in. You can read about the local news in your area, and even log on to your local newspapers website and read the breaking news. Oops, I missed my favorite show that was on @TIME1. Don't worry, you can watch it online. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how entertaining computers are? Computers also allow you to chat with your friends too. Computers are a way to stay in touch with your friends whom you @MONTH1 not see everyday. You can just send them an email, and then they can reply right back to you. Also by using @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and other websites you can talk to friends and @CAPS4 you can even do a video chat, where your friend and you are both sitting at the computer and actually physically talking to each other. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how you can talk to your friends and really enjoy yourselves by using a computer? Technology is something that is really a great thing today. It helps us to research things that we care about and give us answers with one click. It also helps us to do things such as watch videos, read articles, and play games. We can even talk to friends. @CAPS1, computers are a great tool that are really good for people to use and own!"	1940	
1941	1	"Dear @CAPS1 team @NUM1, I saw your ad in the paper and thought i would share my opinions. I believe most people enjoys those family more than a computer, but that doesn't mean they can't go on the computer. If you space time used when the computer instead of long period of time then those concerns would go down. Out of @NUM2 people asked @PERCENT1 have used a computer and still talk when family and get outdoor. Though there is many concerns, they are benefits and using both to keep more managable life. many experts worry because some people are on the computer for hours at a time. This is a concern but I'm sure these people still got out side and exercise. However, not everyone. so if you are sitting on the compuer for hours then you at a higher risk of getting over weight, and not getting to explore nature, Everyone need to get at least @NUM3 minutes of exercise of at least outide activitys such us baseball, football, soccer, tenis and swimming. If sports aren't your favorite then you can hangout with some friends and family. Computers are a great thing but to much can be a very regretful experience. Although computers can have a negitive effect on people, they are extremely helpful to todays society. If kids are having trouble in school they can be tutored online or can talk to someone help. Also, in todays working society computers are used, so knowing how to use are and having hand and eye coordination is a wonderful quality. People that like to travel can map out a trip and pre order items like maps, hotels, plane tickets, and emails that will be happening where they go. If you don't know how to use a computer you @MONTH1 be out jobs. I believe that more people schools use computer for short periods of time and still have time to exercise. This idea @MONTH1 be a better way to keep people more healthy and keep their knowledge to a modern day level. Many benefits and concerns could be brought to agreement. Using free time to use the computer and learn about subjects in school and outside interact like skatebording and guitar or even dancing. So many different people can be interested in computers but you have to make sure that your getting proper exercise and spending time with family and friends. Overall I thinkg people that can not seem to got off computers need a job similar to what they like on computers. For example, if you like racing cars, then you can be a technical engineer. If you like to cook then you can take classes online if your busy a lot. So using both benefits and the concerns you can move life a better for you and others. Weather its too much computers and not enough time outside, with proper time use with computer runy people will be fit and have a better knowledge. Getting peoples ideas and thought can make a society more functional and more knowying about computers and these effects on people."	1941	
1942	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers are bad in many ways, even though they have advantages. I believe that @LOCATION1 depends on computers too much. For example, what if @CAPS4-@CAPS5 decides to @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS1 coast? Entire buissnesses would be lost. Almost every family's savings would also be lost. There would be chaos everywhere. Another thing that happens is that computers fill in job opprutunities so that now the economy is affected. People won't make enough money to buy the things that the computers make. Another crazy thing about computers is that people who use them dont get enough exercise. I mean isn't @LOCATION1 fat enough already? We should all be getting outside for at least @NUM1 hours per day. So whether its exercise terrorists, or just a bad economy, Computers are ruining the world that we now know and love."	1942	
1943	1	"Dear newspaper, I think computers are a positive influense on society. Because the noleg it gives us and the many uses it has for our country and socity today in our generation of tecnology. Haveing computers benefits us in so many way's like helpin us find information on a school project. Also to comunicate with others and have fun on sum of the game sites that provide varius things that we need or want. If you were to do a sorve of how many people have a computer or use one I think you would get @PERCENT1 of our population. Even if it does cause problems with berth I dont think people could go on with there jobs schooling and stuff like taxes when time comes. Last but not least people say that when you use the coputer your not relly doing anything but I beg to difer because when your on the coumputer you always pick up something you didn't know that important. I learning is exercise what is it takes more energy to learn then to run or walk or play outside for an hour a least there not watching cartoons or some outher redicules show insted there learning not roting there brain watching @CAPS1. So in counclusion I think computers are the best thing that was ever invented because all of what you can do on them the cool information that you can find this is why I think that it benefits socity in so many ways."	1943	
1944	1	"Dear, local newspaper place I belive that computer change a lot of things in peoples life. Like the way people do in school, there health and teanagers scoicrel lifes. Computers can help people in school with information for. Homework and find they need. So kids wouldn't have any reason not to have there homework done. On the ohter hand it could be bad with all the new things but today like phone kids can cheat on tests if they wanted to. Computers can also be bad for your health. People tend to get lazy and want to stay on computers to long and play world of warcraft this is same what of a bad because your foced to eat when your in. Then you don't have time to make real food so you eat hotpockets and. Sometimes people stay up much to late to late play games or looking up things on youtube. Scoicle problems iwth computers are another bad thing about coputers on facebook are sometimes fights and then people get angery from @NUM1 notications and then everyones fighting over picture of @PERSON1. In conclustion computers jave there ups and downs but were just going to have to live with them."	1944	
1945	1	"Dear the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about the latest topic has going around. is if computers benifit our society. I will tell you about the good and bad opinions about spending time on the computer and how it help us in our everyday lives. Some of the good things that computers bring to our society is learning. Even adults learn new stuff on computers. You can go on websites and learn new things like a new language, if you never graduated out a diploma. go to college and many others. Some people think that a computer is just can look up online. But it's not only good for that. There is social networks like twitter, facebook and myspace. You can have to friends @NUM1. Also people can connect with their work or schools. Now there always has to be a bad side to everything. Some of the bad things to people on all. Instead that could be out with friends or family, enjoying a walk, and out. And once you get online and become part of something you get addicted for being on the internet all. Another thing we can be for computers are machines. Machines can be used for everything. If its for entertainment, programing, building or surgery. Now almost every hospital is using some kind of machine in over, at @MONTH1. In most our companys it is not people building the cars. It is people controling the machines that build car. In any kind of house/ building / warehouse you will have I machine. Or at least I. As you can see in this letter that we can't live without computers in our everyday lives. We have are around us time. We will always wander why computers weren't softly enough."	1945	
1946	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 without computers is just a waste of time. Computers were designed to ease the work of some bothersome activities. Computers are positive because it is simple to write essays with, there are many educational aspects to them and there is always new and developing technology to learn about. In @ORGANIZATION1, essays will always be assigned. Computers greatly help with this because students don't have to write everything by hand. The computer makes the writing easy to read and edit. It makes a long job very quick and easy. Spell check features teach proper spelling and grammar usage by showing if corrections are needed. This leads to an overall higher quality essay that is easy to correct, all from a computer. However, that's not the only way computers help in @ORGANIZATION1. On any computer, there are ways to extend your education even further than @ORGANIZATION1. There are many @CAPS2 and sites that provide lessons that relate to @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""A computer is a great way to extend childrens knowledge on a topic. Most are simple to use, and they're fun!"" @CAPS2 keep kids interested while they develop more learning skills for the future. This electronically powered machine is great for education. With programs improving, there is always new things to do. Computers are constantly changing and becoming more advanced, providing things to do. @NUM1 computer owners say that the latest developments for computers give them useful tools for daily activities. They also provide people with jobs ranging from repairs to programming. Calendars promote organization and punctual timing. Computerized calculators provide quick access whenever the time should come. Even for a newspaper company like yours can benefit from this technology with virtual newspapers along with normal newspapers. In conclusion, computers are good for everyone because they are constantly developing, they help with essays and assignments, and there are many ways to extend your educational knowledge. After reading this essay I know that you will agree with me. "	1946	
1947	1	"I think that computers are the mores important things to use because they are more thing that you can do on computer. One day I was on the computer write a essay because it had to be typed. So I was in the microsoft word to typed my essay it was better then the notepad. In microsoft word there is a lot more to use for essays. The second reason why computers are better because you can go on the internet to play games, find animals, pictures, etc. The reason why I like computer is because I love to play game on andkon, miniclip, or kings. That is why computers are better then everything esle. The thired reason why I'm writing this is because to help other people to understand why computer are better. People should know that computer are better then phones ipods etc. That why people should started using computer in there house. In conclusion, computer are better then phones. I love to have a computer to learn more in life about other thing that I don't know yet."	1947	
1948	1	"Dear to who it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, A computer has become a way of life these days. Almost every household has a desktop computer and many individuals own laptops. Though everyone depends on a computers they are a waste of time. They @MONTH1 help people communicate and find information, but they are useless otherwise. Computers are a waste of time because they are full of useless websites that do not benefit anyone, they spread rumors and gossip that are completely irrelivent, and they distract people from their real lives. Computers are time wasters aside from a few things like research and email. First, computers are the machines in which someone @MONTH1 use to access the internet. Some will use the internet for business, or work. But most people will use the internet for useless sites like twitter, facebook, @CAPS2, or youtube. Though many will argue this statement those sites are completely irrelivant to a perons outside life and do nothing but waste peoples time on things that won't really make a difference in their life, unlike work. Second, so much pointless gossip has been spread throughtout the internet. Mostly these rumors pertain to pop-culture. Media rumors about celebrities are passed around and become the center of attention. These rumors an gossip do not benefit anyone. You @MONTH1 now know an embrassing fact about a celebrity but does not effect their future. Most rumors are forgotten within months which simply goes to show that it doesn't really matter or have a big effect on anyone in the end. Lastly, the internet can become a huge distraction to nes life. Different rumors, websites, and online games can steal ones attention to their life away. They start to focus on worthless media and don't realize whats important. People are tricked into thinking something like posting on facebook is important and must be part of their daily routine when it really is distracting them from what is important and what should been done daily. Computers, and internet especially, can take hours out of important things people could be doing in life. In conclusion, computers and the internet are a waste of time. Aside from work purposes, computers are a distraction to daily life. Computers offer pointless websites that take up time, spread pointless rumors and gossip, and overall distract people from their lives. Computers should not be banned or anything of the sort, but should simply be used for what is important."	1948	
1949	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 since the day it was invented, the computer has been regarded as a piece of technology that can help us. Over the years, companies and people have modified and improved computers to the point that they can fit in the palm of your hand. We rely on the computers and in return, they do our work efficiently. However, some people are concerned that computers could be bad for us. I'm not one of those people. After all, is there anything wrong with increasing hand-eye coordination, learn about whatever you want, and talk to anyone online all at the single click of your mouse? I used to get ot a @DATE1 camp, where I boarded at a college and took courses for three weeks. In this time, I met plenty of friends. As you can probably tell, by the end of the three weeks, I had to say goodbye-but not before collecting all of their @CAPS3 adresses! @CAPS2 friends came from all over the world. For example, @CAPS2 roommate came from @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2 classmate came all the way from @LOCATION2! Computers, in this case, became @CAPS2 means of communication. I could send all @CAPS2 friends an @CAPS3, and they would recieve it in less than a minute ( much faster, compared to ""snail mail"" which took a few days to receive. @CAPS2 computer allowed me to stay in touch with all of @CAPS2 friends, with-out the costly phone bills, or slow delivery time, @CAPS3 helps almost everybody-from the business people discussing urgent matters, all the way down to people like me, who are just trying to talk to their friends. However, emailing isn't the only good thing about computers! Have you @CAPS1 been assigned a school project on something rediculous that you don't know, like the element of @ORGANIZATION2, or how to build an engine? No matter what topic you're assigned, the internet will have an answer, or at least a theory. A big advantage of having a computer is the fact that there are expansive search engines, such as google or yahoo. Because the internet is unlimited, you can find your answer online, whether it's from the online scientific dictionary, or a nobel prize winner's bestselling book-which is very convenient. By doing so, you literally have access to all of the knowledge in the world. @PERCENT1 of people who use their computer have better hand-eye coordination than those who don't use a computer, according to a recent research experiment. Hand-eye coordination is an @CAPS4 part of our lives. Without it, we wouldn't be able to pick up something, or do most functions with our hand! From these statistics, it's clear that there's a strong positive correlation between using the computer and hand-eye coordination. After all, how else would @PERCENT1 @PERCENT1 of computer users have better hand-eye coordination than people who don't use computers. Because hand-eye coordination is such an important part of our daily routines, I'd say that it's safe to assume that computers benefit society, as well as ourselves. As you can probably tell, computers have improved our world in so many ways. With the invention of super-fast processing computers, we're able to do things even quicker than before. From gathering information, to improving hand-eye coordination, then to communication, I think that we should be able to agree that computers, @CAPS5 not @CAPS4 to the physical needs of the human race, are a wonderful invention that should be cherished, seeing as they greatly help and benefit our society, even up to today! *- @CAPS5 books @MONTH1 hold the same information, it's much easier to find it online rather than skim through a myriad of pages to get your answer."	1949	
1950	1	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I have recently heard about the use of computers and how they dont benefit society. I think that is wrong, computer benefit our society in many ways. Computer teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places. Most importantly allows people to talk online with people all over the world. First, computers have always benefited our society by teaching us hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination helps everyone, people of all ages and for different reasons. It helps us better in sports such as a basketball, football, soccer and all other sports. We have perfected our aim and how to use it to benefit other things. Like if someone through a saccer ball at you, you would have hand-eye coordination and will be able to hit him or her back, im not saying you should do that but the computer has showed you hand-eye coordination. Also, computers have also helped us learn about far away places. Children all over the country have used a computer to help them learn about far away places for project and homework. Even adults as well have used the computer to search about far away places they want to go to. For example my parents have recently researched a place they want to go to for their anniversary, they planned on going to @LOCATION2. Anyways, all im saying is that all kinds of people use the computer to search or learn about far away places. Lastly, we all have used computers to talk to someone. Even if it was your grandmother, we all have done it, for different reasons to. If you didn't get the social studies homework go online and asle a friend, or even a teacher. Sometimes you just want to talk to someone but dont have their number, go online and see if their on. Not long ago I used the computer for this reason, I went online to see if I could find my great grandmother, and I did. I talk to her for hours, she lives in @LOCATION1 and is @NUM1 years old. But understand that any person and every person talks to someone online. In conclusion, the use of computers has benefited us and our society. It has taught us hand-eye coordination, gave us the ability to learn about far away places and also gives us the chance to talk to people online. I think the people who disagree should change their mind about that. Havent you used a computer, doesn't it help your life a lot?"	1950	
1951	1	"Dear cheshire newspaper, @CAPS1 a poll of @NUM1 residents, of all ages, in the town of cheshire, @PERCENT3 said that computer overall benefit our society, more and more people are turning to computers now-a-days. But, not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I believe that computers do benefit society because they teach hand-eye cordination, you can talk to people from faraway places and you can learn new things from them. Firstly, computer involve using the mouse, keybourd and the screen. As an infant, all actions of your eyes on the screen, while you hands on the mouse or keyboard, need to work together in order to complete a simple task of clicking on a website. Due to recent study. @PERCENT4 of the function in your (eye function) and your (hand function) goes directly into the process of making things about. Just using the mouse and screen is great practice, and youth children. Mary @CAPS2 a mother from chesshire, says ""@CAPS3, I didn't allow my @NUM2 year old son the computer because i didn't want him to form any bad habbits. But, he was having trouble with his coordination. so i gave him some educational games in play on the computer for @NUM3 minuts per day and i can already see an improvement."" @CAPS4. Nemur from @ORGANIZATION3 university also that computers are a great way to teach tings that you can't find in a textbook. Do you want your child to talk. very simple quality to ? as you can see computers are great for society because they teach hand-eye coordination. Secondly, computers give you the ability to talk to people from faraway places. My sister @CAPS5 goes to college, and i don't get to see her, every week we and just chat. I would miss @CAPS5 more than i already do if i didn't have a computer, this is the lifestle of many men and women in way, who miss their family. @PERSON1 who lieves with her kids @CAPS6 and @PERSON2 exclaims, "" my husband has been stationed in @LOCATION1 for one years and and the only time I get to talk to him is on the computer. ""@CAPS7 the of three with family members in the war, imagin get a foll report from loved ones. In essense computer can bring a family together. Lastly You can learn new things from computer. A recent study from @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT1 of students use the internet for information on projects, reports @PERCENT2 say that computer won't benefit the society? Most of the information today is not found in book. study from the university of shows that only @PERCENT5 of the information you gather is from reading. a bunch of people would call this unfortunate, but the kids those days are much smarter then kids in the @DATE1's. In addition mostly all buinesses are computer data and importan information. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, all of our textbooks, assignments, and grades are now. The access i have helps me a ton overall computer have much information for our everyday lives. In conclusion, kids learn social techniques such as hand-eye cordination, computers allow you to get much with people around the world, and computers store many things. Which you use daily, You @MONTH1 say that computers do not benefit everyday living, but from the already presented I believe they do. computers are useful, reliable and easy to access, which make them a significant part of the human lifestyle. thank you for you time."	1951	
1952	1	"Computers who need them, Some say there just as bad as tv and I agree for multiple reason's first, your playing game that can be addictive and you cant sleep or eat. Nextly, @CAPS1 time website @MONTH1 have inaproperate lounge or pictures. Last but definatly not least lack of exercise and you can gain plenty of punds. Still think computers strenghen hand eye coordination and give people a chance to learn about far away place so can @CAPS2 and textbooks still dont think computers or bad let me elaberate. First thing first addictive game have a very large effect sometime when your booked on the game you would say ""wait please after I beat this level"" or ""I'll eat after I beat this game on the computer"", @CAPS3 not good to stay on the computer all the time and play play video games the whole time. Then there is impropreite websites with inapropriente langue and peictures a child @MONTH1 stumble on and I hardly dought you @MONTH1 want your kid using inapropriate! Saying and word's into very disgusting and inapropriate pictures while look for a website. Lastly on of biggest reason is the look of exercise that bad you can be wasting your time inside when you can go outside and exercise of interact with friend and family there is so much thing you can do instead of staying inside and you can loose the weight you gain while playing on the computer. In conclusion here what you can do you can go outside enjoy the fresh air and hang out with friends and family I'm not saying @CAPS3 is all bad you must limit the time to a minnimum there is ton's you can do so just do @CAPS3 @CAPS3 can be a good thing."	1952	
1953	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 do have on effect on people, because most people now go on the computer for everthing. A computer is a place where you can chat with your friends, And. just be online all the time without interact with people around you, @CAPS1 I think at this point most teens like to just sit on the computer all day and not have to worry about getting fresh are talking to others gany outside to enjoy the weather most and people just like staying on the computer all day and not worring about there family, And other friends. @CAPS1' to me I really think that computers do have affect not of peoples lives to make than just sit there and stay on the computer all day and chat but most people like gany on the computer because you can sit there and talk all day and not do nothing and not with people you. Most dont know this but it is not really good to have that affect on you because every time you would like to do something you want to leave away from the computer @CAPS1 to have that effect on you about your computer is not really good for you. Its a good thing that you can go online and talk to people but not on the line because people got that effect that makes than want to be on the computer all day. Than your body is not getting a lot of excersis and then that mess up your weight class than you start to become lazy and never want to do any thing, And not go places, @CAPS2 than you wouldnt be fit right and you would a person who lazy and who just work to sit home all the time and be on the computer. @CAPS1 most people who are on the computer most of the time. Should take some time out of being on the computer and give more time to excercising and staying fit and get out the house and enjoy and stop someting most time on the computer @CAPS1 the of this I hope I you and I hope you agree with me about people staying on the computer most of the time and not boring with things than besides on the computer."	1953	
1954	1	"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to learn about something but your knowledge is limited due to you only have books around you, well not with a computer. On a computer you can search anything you want to learn about in the world, communicate through a webcam with somebody thats on another continent, and a computer can be used for movies games and software. When i need to do a big school project i usally use a book a little bit, then i look for legit knowledge on the internet. I find that the possobilites are endless for reaserch on the internet also can be used for pictures or historical artifacts that you would want placed onto your project, or for you to just see a detailed picture on them. I also heard that @PERCENT1 of scientist have information that is of the internet. When my friend moved very far away we would still be able to see each other because we both had a webcam on our computer, so he was @NUM1 states away but i was able to still see him in a video chat. To me thats an amazing step in technology, I amseeing that is being used more frequently for science, lessons in school and etc. Society is defintitly benifiting off of computers. Whenever i get bored i like to hap on my computer and play a game, or watch movies or tv on the computer. There is also other things to do like use videographic softwares or use picture editing softwares. By doing this using a computer has changed my life insort of a way it helped me pick out a curver choice by starting to work in videographics. So town Newspaper artical thank you for reading my letter and listtinng to my @NUM2 opinons on how computers are beniciting society, You can research endlessly, communicate with people on ether continents, and play with games, more and software on the computers"	1954	
1955	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are not making people lose exercise because you get exercise with every letter or word that you type and it is a great way to interacte with family, friends, and a way to meet new people. You can also watch and create you own interesting videos or maybe to get a job because you might be unemployed and need money to pay bills or you want to get car insurance. Their are so many things you can get online that you can't buy at stores. Like real wooden finger boards or tech of of flat face, cum or prowood, You can buy off of any finger board site you wanna buy off of it's fun and easy. If you miss something on the news you can go to and get news in you town when you want it a how you want it. You can use facebook or myspace to interact with you friends and family. You can book vacations or get aways online it any vacation website/hotel websites. You can find your unclaimed money at unclaimedmoneycity.com of money on I have fifty bucks on my how much do you have to find out are click away. If you wanna register you the go online it helps you with your hand-eye-cordination. The internet is can for people all. Your never to old to use of a computer do many thinks like do research a project/report. There are many different computer they called laptops, laptops can have a webcam in they have a screen and a build in keyboard. You can take a with you when you away on a trip or go for a ride in your you can use a laptop basically anywhere you want even in bed or walking just don't drop it if you drop it you might break it then you would to buy a new one which cost a lot of money if you a laptop have money you can enter on you computer to win a laptop or any other thing you heard desires like an ipod touch or you own xbox maybe you can win free games such as skate @NUM1 or call of duty."	1955	
1956	1	"I think that computers are ok because they can be useful at times when it comes to research, location and chat. They can't be useful all the time because they there are pop-ups, and viriuses. Im not saying computers is a good thing or bad thing, it's just ok at sometimes. I think computers are ok because they use very useful. For example @PERSON2 need help finding his friends house but his mom told him to go on google earth or mapquest that helped him alot. Computers are pretty handy especially research but not that much websites are good and that's why you have to find specific information. Without computers, how can people talk to their friends from a far away distance like @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION2 and @CAPS1 or phones were built because of computers when it comes to chatting, emails, and now for game systems also. My @NUM1 reason why computers are @CAPS2.K. because they tick people off sometimes because they would crash or have pop-ups + viruses. For instance, @DATE1. @PERSON1 has to go to her friends but when she hut down her computer a big internet explores sign was her career and it took @PERCENT1 minutes to chat down so she had to get her hardrive fired. And staying on the computer, is not good either you have to take a break so it can @CAPS5 your bill problems or just hang out with your friends because communication is of teamwork and community. My last reason why I think computers are oil because of the @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1 problems with computers and paper work. ""I am glad there was one man and all he did was create @ORGANIZATION1 which was the best selling computers in the country. I am also glad of his work when the computers stopped and they created @CAPS3 box and @CAPS3 box @NUM2. On the other hand like I said before that computers have problems that cause people to lase it. Tons of damaged computers were shown in @LOCATION1 for a program called ""@CAPS5 the Computers @CAPS6"" which tells people to @CAPS5 power to their computers and to get out of the house and have fun outside no matter where you go. Paperwork was used to sign contracts, assignments and documents. From @NUM3 to college senior years. Student's have to type @PERCENT1 of letters projects @PERCENT2 and teachers have to type assignments @PERCENT3. Without typing. Many students will hurt thier palms by writing @NUM4 hours and @DATE2 but thats why we have computers. "	1956	
1957	1	"Dear, Local Newspaper I think computers are great to talk to friends, and family and to look up infermacion. Say you have a project for school you can lock up infermacion for your project or just to find things your cereus about. But a lot of kids spend most of their days on the computer in sted of going outside and have fun or doing actives like sports. So just for all the parents out their, @CAPS1 is a special thing on a computer. This speciel thing can be found in the settings on your computer it ceeps count of how long your kids are on for. If you put a serten time on it, it will turn your computer off on the time you settel. And you need password to get back on so remember the password you selected. So I think if we tell parents these serten things kids will be more healthy and will still get time to go on their computers. So computers are nether good or bad it just depends on how you use them. So try to use them the right way. Just to talk to friends for a little and to do your home work or just to learn something new everyday. So local newspaper please help get the word out and help all people to get more fit and healthy. Thank you."	1957	
1958	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Technology has deffinitly become a part of society @CAPS1 a days everyone's always on their phones, or iPods. Most people have thought that technology is a good thing, but @CAPS2's affecting us because we spend hours on end sitting at the computer. Other think that technology's there for a reason so to use @CAPS2 as much as you want as long as your happy with @CAPS2. I happen to be one of those people that think that too, if I enjoy then I should use @CAPS2. Computers are one of the most common technology known right @CAPS1. I feel that a computer is great because with typing a few words and clicking on some buttons you have the world at your fingertips @CAPS2 makes finding information so much easier, you can find out anything you want, whenever you want without having to go through much difficulty. @CAPS2 doesn't only give you one answer to your question but millions of answers that fit exactly what your looking for. Computers also allow easy comunication, @CAPS3 in the day people would send letters and recieve them in a week, but the internet is international so you can send on e-mail or instant message and recieve @CAPS2 in just a few seconds other people prefer to talk on the phone which is fine too but @CAPS1, as technology is getting more advance you can webchat and see the person as you talk to them, wouldn't that be much better then just hearing and speaking to a relative across the country or a friend in a different country I know I enjoy @CAPS2, almost every week while I webchat with my grandma in @LOCATION1. Computers just get better and better, @CAPS1 a days you can even shop online, for @CAPS4, shoes,accesories anything really @CAPS5't you hate walking around a store for hours, and they @CAPS5't even have your size? I know I do especially with my mom But @CAPS1 you can buy @CAPS4 or anything else you'd like from the comfort of your computer chair and no more waiting in line for hours. Even though people say that computers and technology are bad for society, I disagree and feel that we should be able to use computers as long as we have moderation, because @CAPS2 really is a wonderful thing and we should be thankful for @CAPS2."	1958	
1959	1	"Dear People of @ORGANIZATION2 many computers do you have in you household? I'll admit myself that we have in mine, one for each person. However, I feel, that this technology has had a negative affect on people, despite its benefits to society is a whole at several personal risks, no matter @ORGANIZATION2 safe they think they are. The time spent staring at a desktop is the time you are take away from your own heath, and possible your lifetime. Yes, there are ways to communicate with person on a computer, but this process seperates people from their families, and teaches kids to live in a typed world, so they don't know @ORGANIZATION2 to act face to face. Then there are those people who use computers or any such technology to harm someone. Why would you give the real world for such chances? I have @NUM1 questions for you. @ORGANIZATION2 much time in one day do you spend on your computer and have you ever noticed the correlation between that amount of time and your pant size? A study done by a group at the @ORGANIZATION1 found that for every hour spent on a computer you gaini another half of a. Crazy, right? But this happens because you aren't execising or even just walking during this time, This also accurs because as you sit, there, your body's healthy doing anything, as it slows down your digestive systems. Another way that affects health is that is almost encourages unhealthy habits smoking. @PERCENT1of people who fail at an attempt to quit smoking spend an average of @NUM2 hours per day on a computer. This because your mind isn't, so i'ts free, to give in to small impulses and desires. We all know such unhealthy habit to bad to and eventually . When you ask your child what they do with their friends, you ever locking for the answer. We t'll a lot? No, because you know that the way someone sounds in a writter, phoned message, isn't always @ORGANIZATION2 they are in real life. If you have difficulting talking to or liking a person when you see them face to face, then your relationship with them isn't real. An all can lie to you or be cruel because the person on the other end forgets you are real. Computers are a way for kids to spend all their time on a false relationship. Two polls were taken by the same @NUM3 people. One asked if you had a good, or bad relationship with your family. The other asked @ORGANIZATION2 many hours you spend on a computer. The majority of @PERCENT2 people said the devote @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours to their computers but that same majority also said they have bad relationships with their family members. It doesn't take much to understand @ORGANIZATION2 this happens. Not only is the time separating a family, but as a person gets more addicted to their computer they become more wrapped up in their own, non existent world. Being online can be very dangerous, because there are people out there who want to hurt you, or are just plain bothering you. A few years ago, a teenage girl had a friend she completely truisted that she @CAPS1 often. They planned to meet at a mall. The same girl was found dead in that mall. As you maight have gathered, communications online can be dangerous, and very unsafe. Any one can have access to you and some people will contiunue to pester you wheneven you go online."	1959	
1960	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think that the effects of computers have more of a positive impact rather than a negative one. Computers are great for many reasons and it would be exrenley difficult to do things without these pieces of technology. Computers have positive @CAPS1 because you can chat online with your friends see what is going on in the world, and check email and important events. Chatting online with friends can be a very good thing with thing like chat you can talk to friends plan out things like when you want another about online chatting is facebook on facebook you can also talk to friends but something great about facebook is you can reconnect with old friends that might have moved or gone to a new school. But its not just great for kids. It can be good for adults too! Adults can reconnect with old friends from high school and college and much more. Computers are also great because you can see whats going on in the world. You can do that on @CAPS2.V. to right? that's probably your question but can you check it as quiclky as you went to? or computers. You can. You dont have to watch tall of the news you can just go online and see what is more interesting to you. Checking this on the computer is very important. email updates are this. People can set updates on checks is big too. For example childrens sports are posted online and you can check there. How would you know when you have a sporty, news alot of other events without it? In conclusion I have stated my opinions on why computers have a positive impact. I think we need them u although they are have a. Positive impact because you can chat online, see word news, and check things."	1960	
1961	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 more and more people use computes but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Owning a computer could be a good thing but becomes an unhealthy habit. I believe people spend too much time on computers. People need to get more exercise go outside with friends and family and enchance your learning. If we could get how people think about computer time, it will be a whole new ball game. To start off with families need to get more exercise. Our country is becoming the ""fattest country in the wourld."" personally I think that is the worst nickname for the @ORGANIZATION1. Don't you think so too? Our country needs to get off @ORGANIZATION1 our couches and get off @ORGANIZATION1 being behind a computer screen all day long. Having a computer only makes you lazier. "" @CAPS2 can you go take out the trash"" ""@CAPS3 on @CAPS4, I just started to talk to them!"" @CAPS5't this sound familier? Scientists show after this scene, most likely @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 our country stastys on the computer for another hour. Our country needs to get more exercise. In addition, we really need to go outside more. We should appreciate the outdoors. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 the computer, go outside and play a game with friends, family or a neighbor. There are so many healthy activities you can do outside. Just imagine a warn, @DATE1 day, playing wiffle doll in your yard with your neighbor hood. Maybe not to you, but to me that sounds great compared to sitting inside, in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen. You should really think about how much better being in the great outdoors than playing inside on a computer is. Lastly, people really need to enhance their learning. Sure, you can find facts on the internet, but whatever happened to reading a good book. Sitting on a couch, eating potato chips is certainly not better than readin a suspensful book in the nice @DATE1 breeze. You can read anywhere you want! I know I would much rather read a book thatn "" surf the web"" for hours. In conclusion, these machines are becoming too addictive to our society. We need to stop this before computers swallow our world. People need to get more exercise, go outside and enhance their learning the healthy and proper way. Our society needs to step up and explain how much better it is with less time on the computer."	1961	
1962	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I think that people are spending too much on the computers. I think this because some of my friends now can stay on the computer all day and not go anywhere, also when you stay on the computers you won't be out side and not useing their energy and I read magazines and some stistics say that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 that use computers all the time become oubeast. My first reason why I think people are spending too much time on the computer is, now when I am on the computer people are on all day every day they don't go anywhere they just sit at their computer and just talk to other people. My second reason why I think people spend too much time on the computers is when people are on computers they are not out side when they are on the computer eating a bunch of food they are not out side where they can be exercising and be fit. My third reason why I think people spend to much time on computers is; about a week ago I was reading a magazine and some satistics said that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 that use computers most of their time become oubeast because that's all the time. Now I hope you can see why I think people spend too much time on the computers."	1962	
1963	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 imagining our entire society with no computers. People would be helping the environment and exercising. We would have so many less obese people. Not only that, but hundreds of people have gotten in trouble iver the internet. On facebook and many other sites why would anyone ever want to rsik going to jail? If we don't have computers then these bad thing wouldn't happen, computers are going to always have negative effects an everyone. Today in our economy and environment things aren't doing so well. Forest are being overturend into malls and other shopping centers, oceans polluted by disgusting, black oil. Many people can be worried about it, but wont do anything because the're inside or their computers. They could be helping save the @NUM1 forrests that are being destroyed every year. Insted they decide to go on facebook, myspace, and twiter. If we had more people outdoors working towards a better environment, then I doubt there would be as many issues as there are in the world today. Not only can being outdoors help the environment, if people werent on computers then they would probably be exercising. In the @ORGANIZATION1 @PERCENT1 of the population are obese, This is not right, people shouldn't be sitting on their computers for hours on end. I undestand how this can be hard for some when it come to working on computers for your job. Although isn't your personal health just as importan? Computers can start to get addicting for millions of people so it is important to get over that and do some exercising for a change. Everyone could be so much healthier if they just got off the computer and went for a run. I have heard about so many horrible cases where people have hurt themselves because of what people said to them over the computer. Even though they can have no idea who they're talking to, they would take your own life. This is horrible and has to stop now, people should not be getting hurt over the internet. it is scary to know that there are people out there who would do this. If nobody had computers then lives would be saved and you would have better self esteems. My friend @PERSON1 agrees ""when people are cyber bullying. it takes the fun out of computers and starts to scare me'"" computers are making people and worried. It is obvious that computers have very negative effects all kids and adults. I honeslty believe we should not have computers, without them we could learn to be less obese, and help our world's environment. We would have less incidents of bullying over the internet. Computers have a horrible down-side and end up effecting us all in a worse way than we imagined."	1963	
1964	1	"Did you know that computers have gotten us to move a head to life. I believe that computers benefit to society. I believe that computers allow us to communicate to one another, it can create @LOCATION1 cures and @LOCATION1 technolgy, and we can learn more about the world and society. First computers are a good way to stay intouch with your friends and family or even got to met someone @LOCATION1. From dateing serveses that matches you up to someone you might want to spend to rest of your life with to face book which is were you can chat with friend and family members now you can even video chat. For example this is a great way to comupate and talk to your friends. I go to camp in main and I live far away from all of my friends so the way that I keep in contact with them, is through the computer. Next, the computer is not just for comunication but it can also help invet @LOCATION1 tecnal things. For example if you wanted to build ky @LOCATION1 you could first build it on the computer and get a full view of what it would look like before building it. I watched this show about @PERSON1 and it was saying how they could build a modle of a bike on the computer and find out every they to know before building it in real not pay a single. Also @PERSON2 from the @ORGANIZATION1 stated ""for and we have done everything on the computer"" @CAPS1, computers can catch you up with the latest storys that happend all around the world in a matter of seconds rather then waiting the next day for the news paper to find out the same information that you did right wen it happend because of the computer. One time my friend was traveling out of the country so she didnt have a @CAPS2.V. but she brought her computer and she could watch the news and she could find out anything she wanted to like weather on her computer. Therefore, the computer can keep you informed in everything that you want to know out you just have to be and be careful what you say. Once again computer can help you gey inform in what is going on around the world. It allows you to communicate to family and friends, and it helps us and move on without technology and find cures to help everyone."	1964	
1965	1	"The increasing use of computers to some people @MONTH1 seem like a bad thing but it isn't. In my opinion the advancement in technology can help people because it can help us with bussinesses to make less mistakes in the future. Also, computers are used for research on many things from places to medical issue. In the world of bussiness a computer can be very helpful when it comes to taxes. For example, each year you have to find the total amount you spent on taxes. Many people keep track of this by using a grid or calender of the year. A grid or @CAPS1 on a computer wouldn't take as long to fill out or find mistakes. In designing a buiding you have to draw each room and the demensions of the room. A computer and program will help you fit the peices together so that you building, will have all the right angles and spacing. Finally, in a job where you have to communicate with people from all over the world you might need to share information quickly. For example, a company can have more than one location around the world so if it is found that in the @LOCATION1 a product is failing to work they need to contact everyone immediatly. Not only in buissiness is this helpful but in research for people. Starting very young in life @CAPS3 do research on various topics. In school @CAPS3 do research on places, events, animals and more for projects. This year @CAPS3 dd a project on the @CAPS2 and had to do research from online. Nearly all that @CAPS3 learned to complete this project was found online. By completing this project and using the computers @CAPS3 learned about a topic none of us would have chose to. But for projects and learning isn't the only thing that can be found online, @CAPS3 plan vacations and parties all the time. First @CAPS3 learn about the place and then @CAPS3 contact people to be there and how to get there all by comuter. @CAPS3 also use computers for medical research. Scientists use information posted by others to learn how treatment react with people or chemical interactions. By computer you can also learn different tests used to find the problem with people. or how things should look if they work properly. Finally you can research disease and how people are affected by it. For example, in health class @CAPS3 researched lung disease; how it happens and what it does to body. In knowing this i can prevent myself from experiencing it. Computers can benefit society in many ways because the help us in our bussiness life or everyday life. No matter our age. @CAPS3 will need to research many things to learn and grow as people."	1965	
1966	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, A computer is a high tech, knowledge full devise that is like a huge encyclopedia but easier to use and quicker! @CAPS3 is also a scoial network and helps make new friends in the comfort of your home. You can do almost anything on computers now, find out how people live aorund the world or even just webcam with one of your friends. A huge advantage to computers is world wide web (www.) @CAPS3 can take you anywhere from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. World wide web is like a social highway @CAPS3 cconnects everyone in the world and teaches people how others live. Also with world wide web you can meet anyone through a chat or even a webcam call. Talk about a lot of friends! Some @MONTH1 say the internet is taking away time from family friends and education. I think the complets oppisite! To me the internet is creating so many new opportunitys to reconnect with old friends and make new friends. Also I talk to my friends much more through webcam and chat messaging. When @CAPS3 comes to family we all know that they are a pain to be ground sometimes! So instead of sleeping your cousins where you @MONTH1 get in a fight and even want to go home you can just talk to them for a little while through chat so you can leave the conversation whenever you want! Another great thing about the internet is school! Now some books are online and you don't have to even luggace them home like you used to! Research for projects is also so much easier all you have to do is go on a google and type @CAPS3 in instead of going through tons and tons of books @CAPS3 will take you only one click! Not only are high schools and middle schools using computers for schooling, some colleges even after courses at home on the computer! Nowadays laptops are required fro some schools and a great way to learn new knowledge. Overall computers are a great invention that are very much needed in our society not only do they reach they connect people and also are so much fun! Thats why computers are a great thing to have."	1966	
1967	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers help teach important skills like hand-eye coordination, let people talk and interact with their friends and anyone can reaserch about history or facts on a sertain subject. I urge to you that computers do benifit society. What would you do everyday without a computer? @CAPS4 is a fact that @PERCENT1 of the world has a computer in their very own homes. I know that I use my computer every day. One of the most important things I use @CAPS4 for is school. Some childrens handwriting is so messy that not even their teacher can read @CAPS4 by when you are able to tye a @NUM1 page essay on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you are not able to be neat but @CAPS4 saves time to. For example, @CAPS3 you are not sure how to spell a @CAPS2, you don't have to waste time looking @CAPS4 up in the dictionary, you can use spell check right or your. Also @CAPS3 you find mistakes while researching instead of earasing which is very messy you can highlight what is wrong and backspace @CAPS4. Computers are not just good for school but all of this helps you learn skills like hand eye coordination for when you are older and working! I can remember when I was a horrible typer, and @CAPS4 would take long type one paragraph. But now I speed! I beg you computers help our society! Computers do not only but @CAPS4 is very easy with technology like or @CAPS5 let you talk and about friends likes you to tell the way world! @CAPS3 you friend you dont have and sent @CAPS4 all the way through the mail taking your email is from you have a computer! this new technology people have been able to meet new friends that they never knew were right in their schools! Also with @ORGANIZATION3 you can not only email or @CAPS6 your friend but talk to them live and be able to see their face! I do acnoladge that yong chidren can suntimes use the internet to make fun of or other people but as long as you stay out of the drama @CAPS4 is great to use! I advise you that computers benifit everyone! @CAPS4 is true that every one learns somthing new everyday. Well computers with websights like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS7.con or @CAPS8 allow anyone at anytime, look up anything! For example @CAPS3 you have a essay due the next day with no time to go to the library you are able to search the topic and gather the facts in a given amount of time. Many student and teachers rely on computers for this and without @CAPS4 they could get behind or confused. Computers arn't just good for researching for school but what @CAPS3 you were alergic to gluten? you could go online and not only search for good and what foods you can an a cannot eat but places where you can shop for the food too! In my opinion I strongly thing computer do help our society. Computers are helpful in many ways and they benifit us. You can learn skills, talk to friends and reaserch! I hope you agree because computers really make our society a better place."	1967	
1968	1	"I think that computers benefit society. I think this because they give people the oppurtunity to improve hand eye coordination gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First, one way computers benefit society is that they improve hand eye coordination. This is possible because when you use the computer you can't watch your wouldn't see what happening on the screen. Also the reason it benefits society is that you are now able to do a variety of things such as cook more, catch a ball, and drive a car. These all involve good hand-eye coordination and could lead to job oppurtunities like an athlete, cook, or driver, and obviously a computer tech. Furthermore, one way computers benefit society by teach hand-eye coordination. Next, a why computers benefit society is by giving the ability to learn about this is because the internet allows you to learn many things. Learning about faraway places would benefit society because people. Being open to change and can lead us to a better country and world. The other way learning about faraway places helps us that you learn about different cultures. This also helps because you can learn different. Learning these techniques can spice up your and lead to a buisness. Furthermore, benefits society. Last a way a computers benefit society is they allow people to talk to others online. This is very helpful because you @MONTH1 have a relative who lives far away but you dont have enough money and they, to visit. You can still talk online and not lose touch. Another way talking online helps is it brings people closer together. This is possible because someone you are friends with, but got in a fight or argument with, can talk to you face to face without any tension from being right there. This helps bring them closer by talking it out. Furthermore, talking to people on the internet or online benefits society by being able to talk face to face without being there. Finally, computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about faraway places and people, and letting people talk online. Just think what the world would be like and without them."	1968	
1969	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers have become a very large part of the world today, but the debate over if they have a positive or negative effect on people is ongoing. Computers have a negative effect on people. People use online social networking websites to reaplace real, human interaction. Also, people become addicted to their computer, and lose exercise by idly sitting at the computer. Computers do all the work for people such as finding words in passages so the people don't have to read, too. Computers definitely have a negative effect on people today. Websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and twitter have replaced face to face human interaction. People have lost natural social instincts. For example, when @NUM1 year old college student and @CAPS1 fan was asked how long a day she spends on @CAPS1 'connecting' with people compared to interacting with people face to face she said ""I spend about @NUM2 hours a night on @CAPS1 chatting and talking to my 'friends' and on average I'll see my friends in person about once every two weeks."" This college student has developed unhealthy habits and almost elimated all social, real interactions from her life. Now when she is in social situations, she feels akward and does not know what to say or how to act. Online interaction is having a negative effect on people. The more time that people spend on computers, the less time they will spend exercising. The less that people exercise, the more obese they will become. In a recent study of @CAPS4 families, an average on a week, night the family spent about @NUM3 times as much time on the computer! than they did exercising. When people should be exercising, they are going on the computer instead because it is less stressful and easily accessible. Computers are leading to an unhealthy world. Not only do people not use their muscles as much because of computers, but they also don't use their brains. @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 adults who own computers cannot even do long division because there is a calculator on the computer which can take the place of all math done out by hand or working through the problem in your head to find the answer. You then don't need to use any brain power of smarts to succeed in math. Furthermore, math becomes typing in numbers and pressing buttons. Also, if there is a full page of writing, you would not have to read the page because there is a 'find' button on the computer where you just type the word or phrase that you want it to and then in an instant you have found your answer without using any intelligence. Computers do all of the work for people and are making people stupid. Computers have a negative effect on people. They discourage real human interactions. they make people go on the computer more than they exercise and they are dulling people's intelligence. The more people that have computers, the worse the effect. Computers are a bad thing for humans."	1969	
1970	1	"Dear newspaper, Computers do benefit socity because they help the community. It does have a positive effect on people of all ages. For more older people who don't really know how to work a computer, they can take classes. They can learn how to write on the computer. Play games, go on the internet etc. For more younger kids they can play educational games. Like a @CAPS1 game or a grammer game. Many people @DATE1 go on their computer to learn about far away places such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1. They learn all about there culture and traditions. Its much better on the internet than having to buy tickets and going on the flight. You can talk to people online. Mostly teenagers do it, but some more older people do it to. They have e-mails, aim, facebook and text messaging. There are many positive effects for people who have computers. They lengthen their vocabulary, chat with friends learn about the world etc. To make a long story short, computers do have a positive effect on people. "	1970	
1971	1	"@PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have computors. Is it good or bad for people to use computors? I do believe that computors benifit society. Computors are benefitial in society because computors teach hand eye coordination, give people chance to learn about far away places and allows people to talk to people they might not be able to see often. Computors teach hand eye coordination. Using the keyboard helps kids not rely on sight but on memory. If children learn to this out of memory then they might learn how to do other things like dribbling a basket ball or kicking a soccer ball with out looking at the ball. On a computor they have fast paste video games that make people better at using there hands. Unlike playing sports there is no chance of getting hurt playing video games to make you alert. Hand eye coordination helps children be successful in life" says my doctor. Sure you can learn hand eye coordination in other ways but non or as easy as on the computor. Being on a computor can teach you about far away places in an inexpensive way. If you are studing places in geography that look interesting and you want to see more of that place you can look it up on the internet. On the internet you would probably be able to find thousands of websites with information on the topic. This is benifical because it gives you background knowlegde on the subject. There are many amazing places or objects you would like to go to but you cannot because it is too expensive. On a computor you are able to see these places without having to travel. Sure you could just look these places up in books but this takes too much time. You are able to talk to friends and family online. If one of your friend have moved to a far away place you will still be able to communicat with them. You don't want to loose a freind because of lack of communication do you? If you live in @LOCATION1 and one of your family members live in another country like @LOCATION2 you will not go all the way to @LOCATION2 if you want to see how they are doing if you could just do it on line talking to them online is like being in the same room with them. In conclusion, I believe that computors are benefical in society. Computors allow you to learn hand eye cooridination, learn about far away places, and communitcate with freinds and family. Its now or never do you believe that computors are benifical to society or not. Computors can be benifical to communty. Are they or are they not you deside."	1971	
1972	1	"Dear newspaper reporters, I think that we should keep computers. They're good for people to do their homework, research for a project their doing in school, and you need them if you have an iPod or anything like that to charge and put stuff on them. Some people say that kids are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, but I think the good things overule them. Sometimes you might need a computer to do research for homework or an inclass project. Or maybe some students like to type their work on the computer. That might be better for some students who don't have good handwriting, like me, which is why I'm doing this @CAPS1 on the computer right now. I think more than @PERCENT1 of people will agree after they read this. If you have a portable electronic device that requires a computer, to charge it or put things like music, videos, pictures, apps., etc, how will you do that? I have a @CAPS2 player, and it needs a computer. I can't charge it or put music on it without one. Also, I think at least @PERCENT1 of people with jobs need a computer. My dad's job is to work with computers, so he can't not have one either. If he didn't, I don't know what his work would be doing. In conclusion, I think we should keep computers for the benefiting reasons. If you have a problem with your kids, set a time limit on how long they can be on the computer, and then say they have to exercise. Please take my suggestion!"	1972	
1973	1	"Do computers keep people from enjoying the outside world? I think that computers take up peoples time and don't allow them to go outside. The first reason is people spend too much time on computers and get loss exercise. The second reason is computers don't allow you to enjoy nature. Finally computers keep you from interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt computers keep people from enjoying the outside world. People spend too much time on computers and get less exercise. If people eat junk food and other non nutrious food and go on the computer and no exercise it could cause them to gain weight. If people gain to much weight and still go on the computer, at same they will become obese. Exercise is great to maintain yourself fit and active and allows you to use and move your body. While on the computer you only use your hands which is not exercise. People spend of there time on computers and less enjoying nature. It is really wonderful to walk in beach or go for a walk at the park and leting the wind blow across your face instead of siting on a seat glancing at your computer. People have better times go out, breathing fresh, leting the sun touch their skin but on the other hand people look at pictures on nature on their computer which most be really dull. It is better to experience stuff in real life than on your computer screen. No doubt it is better to enjoy nature in real life. It is really for to interact with family and friends than chating online. You get to go on family food trip amusement parks which is a so much cooler experience than chating with friends. You can have play with friends and actually do correcting instead of typing on your keyboard. Interacting with your family and friends is active, fun and could be adventurous computer. No question interacting with family and friends is better than being on your computer. As you can see going out and having fun is better than being on the computer. The first reason is you exercise and go less time on your computer. The second reason is you enjoy nature. The final reason is you interact with friends. The real world is better than the world that is in your computer."	1973	
1974	1	"In my opinion computers benefit the society very much. They can have a very positive effect on all of the people who use a computer. For instance computers can teach you about far away places and people that you might never get to see or know about otherwise. You can also meet a whole bunch of new people online. You can make new friends or even find someone to spend the cool of your life with. Computers also have a program you can type your papers and have them checked. @PERCENT1 of all college students say that typeing in much faster and easier to do than writing. Wouldn't you went to be able to write papers much faster, and have than instantly ? Computers can teach you many things, exspecially about different places around the world. If you wanted to know what the capitol of brazil was then you could just the computer and look it up, easy. It would be much slower if you had to drive to the library, look it up then go work have. The would be wasting gas too, which is very expensive right than. there is so much on the computer that you could find anything. Say you would in know with a deep like, just computer and look it up. one time I . So I went to the computer and typed along with the music video and to the thing. I had found all . Computers meeting . you can @NUM1 out of online. That is a lot of people. You can also meet people you just want to be friends. With online, say like a . Instead of which , exspecially a across the ocean, you can use email. Email is also almost instant. You can have more conversations and become faster friends than just through letters. If you have to write papers for college or work, it is much faster and easier to type it! Many college students have laptops they around with then to type notes and do homework @PERCENT2 of college students say that it is easier to type notes and homework. They say this because if they make a mistake, the computer will automatically fix it. So they can just type without having to go back and fix mistakes themselves. With a computer you can also project what is on it to a big acreen. That way you don't have to wrote a whole of paper copies. Don't you want do less paper do save tress? All of these reasons benefit the do a great . Using a computer helps you learn about new places and people, meet new peopl, and write need, planted or school. So computers are a great benefit to our society and will continue to be even better."	1974	
1975	1	"Dear @CAPS1. T @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you know im writing to you about the effect computers have on people. I would agree that computers do benefit society because it allows us to learn anything we want to learn. Computers also help kids in school when they need research of a specific topic. My first reason on how computers benefit society is it helps us kids & teens have information on anything in the world. In fact just @DATE1 the computer helped me in my research for black history and found that very useful. Besides research it has practically everything you need to know from A-@CAPS4. The next reason why computers benefit society is by letting us communicate with other people around the world by using special websites like a skype or @CAPS5. When we can talk to people around the world you could be tought a new language or learning about another foreign culture. Our computer also help people paybills and do takes online and saving time rather than doing it by hand because they have or her block. Third I can see how the computer is bad for you but thats why they have games like dance dance revolution or rockland because a study has been taken that playing rockland you can burn @NUM1 calories for playing @NUM2 mins which way most sound like alot so imagine playing for @NUM3 mins, you could burn up to @NUM4 calories which is equivalent to eating a @NUM5 calories pack. Finally, just get on a computer and see how much fun it is to use wheather your playing a game or talking to other people online or researching a project or question. The computer can benefit you!"	1975	
1976	1	"Dear newspaper editor, I believe that computers do benefit because the increase our knowledge, computers also help in socializing because write to them and they help till time. The first reason that computers helps us is by letting us about learn about topics that would've been otherwise unknown, for example, you can learn about distant countries and locations.  Imanige, not knowing what's out your state, or even your distant. That path would be cruel. The most important knowledge the computer gives us is the knowledge about business and stocks which in were changing unvichles are would never know. Knowing business helps later because the knowledge will get you a job  is your source pf money The money, like everyone knows will increase the quality of life. Another good reason, which helps the the computer helps with people @CAPS1 you world where without seeing them in person? As With the computer, you can keep by Which and hand speed as well as objects. Hence @PERSON1, computer and all of technology s not a badthing and is a good progression."	1976	
1977	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you like to keep in touch with your family and see how their doing or @CAPS1 yo be fine that you will never be in contalk with them? Yes I do agree that computers benefits society because computers help students learn more faster and easier, computers will help you keep in toch with your family, and their cheap. Computers will help students learn more faster ans easier in nschool and aven at home. For @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 middle school students are doing this daily @CAPS4 proname it's called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Im takeing this proname too, we @CAPS1 go down to the computer lab on @DATE1, and @DATE2. Know ill really bad at @CAPS4 it takes one weeks to learn something so im thinking cool we get use computers every student in the school lone computers. The prgrane teaches everything about @CAPS4. Frist teaches your times table chart witer I hate! When I get on the computers I allready learned ny @NUM1 times table it was so @CAPS3 I memroized every fact and it was really fun and @CAPS3. The computers help students learn @CAPS3! Its easier for them because you know how class and a teacher's walks by you and looks aven well kids think their doing something wrong and when your have this class clear then we @CAPS1 love to stop the and we to all himto settle above. Well thats wasting time for students this computers helps us! Also the great scientis @PERSON1 her did on expirment on coumputers to see if they help students learn more and esier to asked half the school @MONEY1 @CAPS5 to learn about or re goverment by text and the other half to learn about it an computers. The data shows that only @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 student learn from.Know if computers the other half @MONEY1 student learn form computers the percentage will increase! Computers keep in touch with your family. For @CAPS2. @MONEY1 @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people all around use computer's to keep in touch with their family member's. Computers help keep in touch abd in case a family member is in trouble their family could com and help. If there wernt computer's then people @CAPS1 be mesiarble I know I @CAPS1 be not knowing if your family members are safe is very hard. How @CAPS1 you feel if you couldnt keep in toch with your family? this @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people being happy will drope. In addition to this I read a @CAPS7 about a kid who was living with his aunt and where in the @CAPS8.S and his mom was in @LOCATION2 molding. His aunt and where didnt have a computer so how was he suppose to keep in toch? well they didnt the was so sach he gone crazy and sick that he died! computers help us stay with are family. Computers are very cheap know a days and could help the econmie. For @CAPS2 computer's are @NUM2 @NUM3 a day's so a lot @MONEY1 people are buying them this is bringing money into the econmie. The money can help pay for the army, built shelter's, and it can help are town get better. Also, are @CAPS10 @PERSON2 said ""having computer will make you succeful, and save you mony!"""	1977	
1978	1	"Dear Local news, @CAPS1 people are addicted to the computer. Did you know that about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 and adults are addicted to the computer? Acording to @PERSON1, a professer for @NUM1 years says, ""@CAPS2 we did the studies about computers we were noticing that the amount of @CAPS3 and adults using the computer was a huge amount of population"". As you noticed, using the computer is very common especially if you have one at home you get addicted. One you touch the mouse, you wouldn't want to get off. If you go on the computer and you have things to do the next day, trust me you won't have time, to do what you have to do. It's like the computer you down and not letting you go. And instead of you not paing attention its feed in. A formal amistad academy student named @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 reports to us ""I have a serious problem, once I get home at @TIME1 I go streight to the computer. I stay there from @TIME1@NUM2 a.m. I don't get much sleep and I don't do my homework because im addicted to the computer."" @CAPS3 can get exausted but they don't care they still go on no matter what time. Since we heard the student @ORGANIZATION1. She brought me to my next point about homework. If @CAPS3 don't react fast they will have bad grades in school. Acording to @CAPS4 songs, a principal for @NUM3 years announces that @NUM4 of @CAPS3 don't do their homeworke because they are into the computer. The world is not recognizing what the computer is doing to their young adults and how it's inpacting on them. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 don't go outside, spend time with their families, or friends just to be on the computer. @NUM5 of @CAPS3 all over the world decide to spend time at home in the internet then to join their families to an important place or just to be with them. We might be young but we only live once and we have to make the best of it and not stay on the computer. So this question is for you to think about! Its now or never, are you going to quit or feed into it? Are you going to be one of the @NUM6 people to be addicted acording to the widsome technology program's data? Think about your actions because at the end your choice just impact you and your behaviors."	1978	
1979	1	"Computers do have a good benefit on our society. I know this because computers teach, computers make things easier, and they are not a big impact on most lives. These things make computer a good thing to have in the world. Every kid at some point or another in their school experience will learn to type. typing is a ciriculum in most schools. Without computers this would not be possible. Computers also teach people about places they have never been and @MONTH1 never go. If you live in the country and didn't have a computer, you @MONTH1 never know what kind of world in outside your small farm. Last, computers teach social skills and about different people. Most kids have @CAPS1 and talk to each other every night, being social. People with different cultures are all over the internet for people to learn about. Computers teach things that some schools can't by themselves. Computers make humans lives easier because of what they are of. Have you ever been to a library without an @ORGANIZATION1 system? I haven't, but @CAPS2 would be hard to find the book you're looking for without that computer. In school we learn how kids in the old times always wrote on chalk boards. When I go to write an essay I want to type it and not write it out(especially). Typeing it also makes the essay easier for the teacher to read. Some kids have. Last, my mom works from home and she relys on her laptop to get work done. laptops make things easier for working can work home. Laptops are good in our society because they make things easier. I don't think that computers have a huge bad impact on peoples lives. How many adults have you seen playing away from on the computer. Many adults get up and get fresh air whenever they can. Computers a huge impact on kids because their parents watch them closely. Every one while you will a parent kid play on the computer. parents how much time. Last, computer are not the only electronic in the world. There are @CAPS3's, @CAPS4, play stations, and many more. So, computers aren't the only electronic causing problem. on that note, computer don't have a huge bad impact on people. In conclusion, computer have a good benifit in our society. They teach 'us, make everyday things easier, and don't have a huge bad effect on society. So, we should stop blaming computers for the reasons why less people can going outside and getting exercise."	1979	
1980	1	"Computers are amazing pieces of technology. We as the human race have come so far to develop this fantastic machine. Some people think that they do not benefit society and I am not one of those people. I believe computers can help you in so many ways hand-eye coordination on giving students a way to learn about almost anything even having the ability to chat online can help you. Sure, playing catch with dad can teach you hand-eye coordination but so can computers. The benefit to using a computer over catch is that you are constanly your skills no matter what you decide. You could be playing a game, chatting with a friend or even typing one and you still be moving had-eye coordination. One friend of mine with a disebility began to use the computer ar a very young age. By the time she was out of @NUM1 grade her parents said that ger hand-eye coordination had improve dramatically because of her use of the computer ther had at home. I never thought that using a computer could help somebody about much somebody asked, ""@CAPS1 isnt it better to go outsick play and catch instead of being lazy and using the computer all day?"" I do agree with that, but I think using computers are benificial as long as you only spend a limited amount on it per week. The rest of the time you can go any out with friends or play your favorite sport. You are in social studies class and you have to make a project on same place across the globe. How do you learn about this faraway place? to your computer and look it up on the web. I believe researching online os much better than reading about it in a book. Why? When using the internet you can search the exact information you need instead looking through all of books. The computer will save you a lot of time when researching. Research shows that student prefer to go to a website with colors, links and pictures as oppose to boring textbook. In addition to improving hand-eye coordination and learning about facinating around the world, computers can help with communication. Not only can you instant message your best friend in @LOCATION1 but you can video chat with your cousin too! I love to see my cousins hit rarely can, so I video chat with er instead. Video achatting, email and instant messaging are all ways to communicate over the computer many more. This your has ll been about trying to the placed and going green and believe it or not but computers are helping a lot with that instead of wasting paper by writing a letter, you can send her an email. Not only does it save a lot of trees but the message gets to her much faster in about @NUM2 seconds to be specific. Computers have saved a lot of time and money computers go back a long time ago, and have developed into great pieces of technology today. Just to recap, the wonderful device can improve hand-eye coordination give people a better and quicker way to learn about the world and so in unusual ways help save the environment. Plus, almost most every college requires that you have a computer and know hot to use it if you don't use a computer or don't have one, you can go to your local library a friend. You might be surprised the things you can do with one."	1980	
1981	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have been seeing many adults, kids, work company using computers now a days. My opinion about this is bad for @NUM1 main reasons most things you do on a computer you can do in real life. Most funs things in life you can't do in real life, and being on computer gives no exercise at all. Would you want to fat? I ask this because when your on a computer your not doing anything to give no exercise. The rate of obesidity vs increasing @PERCENT1 of the population every year. This means eventually everyone in the @LOCATION1 will be fat. This could just be solved by ether not supporting the advances of computers or exercising after your on the computer. Would you want to go @CAPS1 world! If your on a computer you can't enjoy something as if you where actually there. You can read about @CAPS2 or see pictures, but @CAPS2 will never be the same feeling as if you actually went on that ride or eating that ice cream. What is the point of a computer if you can do @CAPS2 in real life? You can do many things that computers does. For example if you need to find a word instead of looking @CAPS2 up on the you can. My friend once said, ""@CAPS2's easier to open a dictionary and turn to a page then to turn on your computer and look up a definition. Knowing all the facts why do you use a computer when you can do @CAPS2 in real life, why you want obesidity, or why would you wont to look at something if you could actually go there. Now go and tell your child to stop playing on the computer or stop yourself."	1981	
1982	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I strongly believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and spending less time with their family and friends. I also believe that being in @CAPS1 of the computer all the time is distracting them from getting their homework done and grades are dropping. Also these people would starve to death just to not get out the computer and walk to make themself something to eat their health is not good. My first reason why I believe with this statement is because theres to many people that stay at home all day on the computer and they don't go visit there family and friends spend time with them go out for dinner done of that they just want to be home on the computer. Secondly there grades are dropping and they not doing there homework because as soon they get out of school they go straight to the computer. I feel that education comes first. Thirdly people are lazy and when they are attached to the computer they don't want to get up and make themself some food. I am concern because they is not taking care of their health. These are the reason's why I believe that people are spending too much time on the computer than with family and friends or doing homework or eating taking care their health."	1982	
1983	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know about @PERCENT1 of human race spends their time on the computer. You might say that is ridiculous, but its true. In almost ever home the have either a desktop computer or a laptop, rather they use it for research, communication, or even just to have fun, but I know some people think different. Some people think that computers are stopping or keeping people from exercising, enjoying nature, and even stopping them from interacting with family and friends. Now I think that is stupid, but if you still don't agree with me read on. Why do people say that computers stop some people from exercising and having fun. When you can have fun and you can exercise on the computer. I know you are thinking how can you exercise on the computer. To tell the truth it is simple all you have to do is decide what time of exercise do you want. Once you do that, it is your decision to do the exercise or not so people need to stop blaming things like on the computer because its not the computers falt that some people are just to lazy to do any exercise. Plus you can have fun on the computer. You can play games, and you can even shop on the computer now. Just try you just might like it. Are you enjoying this research about nature on your computer. I bet you are. In your head I know you are probably saying that you can go out side and enjoy nature or read a book and enjoy nature, but say you see a pretty flower and you don't know what it is called and you want to learn more about it, but your book doesn't have that specific flower in. So the only choice you have is to use your computer to find the information on your beautiful flower but you do more than find a research on a flower on the computer you can look up things in history that you didn't know or you can even find out things about your favorite animal or even your favorite sports team or player. You still don't with me about the computers, if you don't then just read on. Alright now from information I have found out that you think peop can't communicate nor interact with each other using a computer, but they can. Some people use computers to communicate with their family members and their friend. They would even be able to see each other if they have a webcam, but say that their is some that doesn't have a phone and they are able unable to go out side. They only way they can communicate is by a computer. Still it there are people out their that would sit in front of the computer than go and sit out sit with their families than that is their buiness. Now I know you agree with me now. Its not the computers fault that some people are just to lazy to do anything but sit there and stare at the computer. It's their buisness it they don't have fun, or communicate or even get off their buts and exercise, that is their buisness."	1983	
1984	1	"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 are a great advancement in technology. They are helpful lin life however they take away a lot of your life. People use computers too much and not enough time exercising, being outside, and spending time with friends or family. The @CAPS1 does have a negative affect on people. People dont exercise enough any more. Fewer and fewer people go to the gym every month. The reason for this is because of other things, like computers, to ocupy their time. Computers are used for people to do school work, fun, or for their job. Children do home work and type essays all the time on the @CAPS1. They also play games on the internet or go on websites to talk with friends like @CAPS2. Even adults use computers at work or work at home with a @CAPS1. With all that is availible on a @CAPS1, when will people workout? This hapens to be one of the leading causes for weight gain in the @LOCATION1. No one exercises their body anymore, just their hand on the mouse and eyes on the screen. Fresh air is one of the most refreshing things outside. People dont take advantage of these wonderful things in nature because they lock themselves inside and use the @CAPS1. Peoples lives revolve around the @CAPS1 so much, that they dont camp, fish, or swim anymore. The @CAPS1 doesn't move away from sight of some kids. That isn't healthy at all. Going outside and playing sports is however. Trees and forests are being cut down more and more and soon there wont be much left. Get up from the @CAPS1 and go out before it is too late and nothing is left. Soon you will learn about wilderness by the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS1 alone. When do you see your whole family in a year? Christmas? Thanksgiving? That is not enough. You should spend most of your live with relatives or even just friends. Talking face to face with them is not a usual thing for people anymore. Now you can comunicate through typing on the @CAPS1. It isn't the same as talking in person. The @CAPS1 cant send you their expression on their face when you tell a joke. All it will tell you is @CAPS3 @CAPS3 @CAPS3 or @CAPS6. But what is that to you? Just another word or phrase. Plus, a @CAPS1 cant give you a hug to show the other persons affection towards you. You cant hear their voice or their laugh, or see their face unless you spend time with them. Computers cant keep you warm at night people do. As you can see, computers are on advance in technology, but use too much of our time. Computers dont help us lose weight, see the wilderness, or give you love like a family does. You cant replace your life because you reglet wasteing it on the @CAPS1 @CAPS7 it is gone it is gone for good. If you let it a @CAPS1 will completely consome you life."	1984	
1985	1	"Computers are a tectinacal advancement in today's society. I think computer benift society. First, you can talk to people online. Also, they teach hand eye coordination. Lastly, there a good tool for research. Imagine the pain of all of those high cell phone bills or texting bills! With a computer you call people and @CAPS1 for free online, there are some programs that are @PERCENT1 free that allow that next, with a computer you can always stay intouch with someone @CAPS3 matter where they are. Also, with the ability to talk to people online it will be easier to met new people to be friends with. Lasty, some people say ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3, my kid i'f he talks online he will talk to random people we don't know!"" But smart, logical know its good to met knew people. You know whats @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!!, Those people who have @CAPS3 hand eye coordination. First of all, when your in gym and some retard can't catch a @CAPS4 it's pretty lame. Also, with a computer you can learn that and stop being the kid that in gym class is always, picked last because he can't catch @CAPS5! Next, seriously it really grinds my years. When people have the technology to change something and they do nothing. Lastly, one day your really going to need to learn how to catch and you won't be able too. And, @CAPS3 hand eye coordination,well thats @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Also, this is a call out to all you scientist who are too lazy to find a cure for cancer. Ever have trouble trying to find a piece of research for a school project. Well baby, if thats that case, you need are @CAPS3 product rulled computers. First of all, computers are the future @CAPS6 you want to know just google it. Also, some really dumb people disagree with me well screw them because cool people know thats a load of dierru! Next, with a computer a whole new world of knowledge is opened. Lastly, qouted by @PERSON1 a computer genius ""@CAPS6 is possbile to find on a computer if you know were to look!"" In the end computers benift society. First, they cand help you chat with others. Also, they can help your hand-eye coordination. Next, they can help you research things. Lastly, these are my @NUM1 reasons and if you score me below a @NUM2 for this well..... thats @CAPS4 @CAPS5! "	1985	
1986	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagen living in a world with out any computers? Computers help you get in contact with anyone, gives you the ability to learn faraway places and gives you all the education you need. This is why I believe that having computer benefits society. While your setting infront of your computer being on a website like facebook.com and you notice many @CAPS3 people who joined that website. You start to notice a picture of one of your old friends from years ago, and you quickly get in with them. This is how the internet and computers @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of people who have computer find their long lost friends, sisters,parent and many more. I remember a time when my mom was on the computer chating with a friend of hers from @NUM1 years ago. When my mom found her she was very jubilant than she invited her over and they got to catch up on so many things. Wouldn't you like that to be you, finding many of your old friends and siblings? The computer has so many websites that help you learn about the world, and helps you get to so many places that you never heard about. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 magazine states that the computer helps many people get to places with having the exact direction of them. Statistic shows that at least @PERCENT2 of the people who go on vacation tpo faraway places use many websites, such as @ORGANIZATION1 to get to where they need to go. In having computer would help out so many people who help out so many people who are @CAPS3 to states like conneticute. Do you remember back in time when you were more months of school you, quit? Now having computers and the internet would help out so many young kids even grown ups still get the education they need. @CAPS2 that I found out was that at least @PERCENT3 of people take online classes to get the education they mused. A proffesional @CAPS6 @PERSON1 said that from the @PERCENT3 of people who take online classes more than @PERCENT2 pass with a diploma or degree. Wouldn't you want that to be you? In conclusion, having computers will definitly benefit the society in many ways. Computers would help because it will give people a chance to get in contact with anymore give the ability to learn faraway places and most importantly get the education they need had. Thats why @NUM2 believe having computers is a good idea."	1986	
1987	1	My opinion about computers is that they help hand-eye coordination. This is good as it helps retiexes and reaction time improve. Also you can learn about famous people and places. So this has to be good for the brain. This is why I think computers have very good effects on the human brain.	1987	
1988	1	"Dear @CAPS1 paper, I think that the evolving technology has a better impact on society with newer technology things become more portable and brings people together. Technology also keeps people from being bored. First off the old computers were un realistic. They took up whole rooms and were slow. Now computers or anything technological can fit in a pocket. Computers are a lot faster and more reliable. Being portable also allows people to go anywhere and still be connected. With technology comes connections. People are able to talk to people halfway across the world with technology. Cellphones are a great idea also. A child could get lost in the mall, or an adult get lost in the. Either way, the person can call for help. Television allows a person to be updated on whats happening around them. We all know what its like to be completely bored. But, with new technology, anybody can be entertained. There are games online music, endless possibilities. Now @CAPS2 are becomming less bored. By not being bored, @CAPS2 wont eat whenever they feel like it, therefore they are healthier. People can still exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with their family and friends. They can do it all with technology. Technology is portable, allowing people to go into nature with it. People can be connected with technology. Boredom is also cut down with advances in technology."	1988	
1989	1	"I will be writing about people that like learning computers. Also people that don't like learning about computers. First I will be talking about people that like computers. For example, people like learning hand-eye cordinate, learning faraway places and people. Also to talk online with friend and other people. People could learn how to create their on website. Like myspace that was created by a guy. People love spending alot of time on their computer. Which is sometimes not good for them. They could sometimes get blind and they nees glasses. When they are myspace and they talk to somebody and that person didn't mean that he or she said they could cause trouble. Thats why being on the computer its not good. Sometimes is good or bad being on the computer or not being on the computer. eople like doing exercising and not being on the computer. People also don't like doing exercise and like being on the computer. So people could do both couple of hours doing exercise and a couple of hours playing or being on the computer. Now people can't complane for spending to much time being on the computer or complaning that people exercise for no reason. This is the reasson why people like learning about computer. Also people that don't like being on the computer. So this is my story that I talked to you about."	1989	
1990	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of people using computers then going outside is if you stay, inside all day doing nothing but sitting by the computer is a waist of time. What's so important on the computer that catches anyones attention like really I know you can e-mail friends, family but you can also call them and meet up somewhere so you can got out to eat or go hang out or something because staying home on the computer is'nt realy healthy fer you I mean like you can miss out on a lot like a birthday party or maybe someone in his/her family past away or just a speacial event that someone wants you to go to. So you can support them but if your just at home sitting on your butt on the computer no one is going to be needing you. Matter a fact they'll probably forget about you and then when you need them they want be there to help you out because you weren't there for them so thats why we we should all get up and hang up the mouse and put it to rest and go outside to have some fun."	1990	
1991	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree that computers benefit society. Some of my reasons are: They teach hand-eye coordination, gives kids and parents the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lastley you can talk with friends and family members. Hand-eye coordination isvery helpful. When children get older most jobs deal with computers and they will need to learn how to type. Studies show that @PERCENT1 more people that know how to type howe better jobs then people what don't. Gives people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and maybe even religons. With computers people will learn about other king of people around the world. They can learn what they eat, what time these school starts in the @TIME1, and much more. You can also learn about places like @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, france and many other places. There are pictures, descriptions, and the type of animals life there. Lastley you an learn about people's religons. My last reason computers benifit society is that you can talk to people on certain websites. Is you have family members that live faraway you can talk to them or video chat with them. Maybe your bestfriend moved across the country you can also talk to them on websites like @ORGANIZATION2, twitter, facebook, and @CAPS2. Even though computers are fun and helpful you should always take some time to go outside and enjoy nature. Thats why I think computers benifit society. They teach hand-eye coordanation, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and talk to family or friends."	1991	
1992	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 Have you ever been bullied before? Cyberbullying is worse and it is not fun. Computers can be quite dangerus and very time consuming. Some people spend hours and some times days on the computer. It gets in the way of many activities and deprives time from friends and family. Many people that spend most of ther tim on the computer becom over whieght due to lack of exersize. ""@CAPS2 get about @NUM1 calls a month complaining about cyber bulling. And some suasidal atempts."" says officer @PERSON2 ove the @CAPS3 police department. Being cyber bullied is a very dandurus situation. Sights such as @CAPS4, A.I.M., @CAPS5 and @CAPS6, are all sights that people can be bullied on. @PERSON3 spends most of his time on the computer. He stays on for hours and hours at a time. One @CAPS1 his mom had to go out of town. She left him a list of things he needed to do by the time she got back: clean room, practice trombone, walk the dog, do homework, feed the dog, and work on a project for boy scouts. @PERSON3 got on the computer and did not get off untill his mom got home. None of the things on the list were done. He got in huge trouble. Did you know that kids miss @PERCENT1 of there family bonding time while they ar on the computer? ""More half of my patients are obece because they are on the computer when they should be going outside, running around, working out walking the dog are exersising in general. This makes it harder for them to loes wheight"" says @PERSON1, spesialist in wheight, gain, loss, obesity, exersise and diet. People should be exersizing much more instaid of sitting @CAPS1 after @CAPS1 at the computer. It's not healthy. Computers arn't really benifiting our sasiaty. They are putting as in many ways. People should get off the computer more and do something active."	1992	
1993	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for this letter is that we should have computers because it can help you and they are better and the technogy is better. First is that computers can help you learn how to type. If you did not have one back in the day. They also can help you learn about people that were or are famous. Also you can look up things like the news and what happened back then. You can make charts for school, work, or even home on the computer. When you what to travel you can buy tickets online and maybe get goods seats. These are a few reasons why the computers are helpful. Second the computers are way better tha type writers because they are less work for you. Because when type writers were around the buttons were hard to push and you had to push the proper back and froth. But if you have a compter it is a lot easier, the keys are light to push and the computer auto-madicly goes on the other line itself. You don't need to keep putting paper in the computer because does that for you too. This is why compters are way better than a typewriter. Finally is that technoly is better because back in the day you had to write letters to people and had to wait for weeks for it to come back. Or it might get lost in the mail room so the person might never get it. But with compters you can send an e-mail to people and the can get in two seconds flat. And it is a lot faster than mailing a letter in the mail. And this is why technology is way better than sending letter in the mail than just sending on computer. @CAPS1 opion is that we should have computers because it can help us much better."	1993	
1994	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Who needs them any way I know not @CAPS1 people do! Computer effect anyone for various reasons just like a viris or spam that leads to your computer being broken. Yet there are still worse like cyber bulling and scams that can bring you down to debt. Now I you to listen up and head on. One reason computers are iritating is their virises they sound all over the internet just waiting to eat your computer away. About @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer get shut down by a viris. Soon messages do the same they pop-up right on the screen sometimes saying ""You have just won the million dollar prize"" @CAPS1 people are careless enough and just click the message, as then another box pops up asking for impormation. This is where scams come in. Another reason would be scams. Scams are one of the worst, like I said about an information box will pop-up asking @LOCATION1 , @CAPS2 security number, phone number, adress and name. How is doing enter, some scams will show you much you said. @CAPS1 people claim they dont pay a, but they actually did it @CAPS3 in debt. My last example who computer cyber bullying, over @PERCENT2 of people. Cyber bulling is when one person on the internet or a or brings them big verbal, now you dont want that to you, do you? I remember when kids hated me and picked on me, @CAPS4 I stayed home but get on the. I still get @CAPS4 now what ever you do just do the right thing and don't be like me or any other american that has a time with any computer just don't."	1994	
1995	1	"Dear Newspaper editor, @CAPS1 this, you're late for an interview when you realize you've forgotten the address you were emailed. So you hop on the computer, but before you know it it's been an hour! This is because I think computers are very time consuming and you don't enjoy everything that's around you. You also don't spend enough time exersizing because people are always infront of on a computer, and finally you should be talking to people face to face, it would build a better relationship between you. So please listen to why I thin computers can be an agrivating item in people's lives. When you first go on a computer, your first thought is mostly, ""@CAPS2, only for a minute,"" @CAPS3, that minute can turn into an hour before you know it. This is because when you're of something and there are so many possibilities of what you could do, you want to do them all, and everything is pretty much docked out. So you wouldn't realize what time had gone by, anything that was going on around you. How many times have you gone up to someone on the computer and said something to them, and you just got a nod, or maybe even no response back? I know I have, because you don't really hear what people are saying to you, because your so-hipnotized and focuse don what's happening on the computer. Secondly, if you're always on the computer, you're not getting enough time for exersizing and fresh air. You can't just be kept inside not moving all day, more and more people all over the world have been gaining wait for lack of exersize. Do you really want to see yourself, your family being in front of the computer? Of course not! you want to see them healthy having fun, and outdoors! Also, when you're on the computer, and it is very time consumming. You won't be able to get what you need to do, like papers, homework, bills, anything! More so, yes, you can talk to many people over the computer, but wouldn't much rather see them in person. When you talk to someone over the computer it can be very dangerous sometimes, also many people are more willing to say harsher things when it's over the computer and not face to face. And wouldn't you rather sorte a conflict out comly, then using bash mean language? Also when you're talking to someone in person, face to face; it builds a better relationship between you two. Iwould much rather being hanging out, outside playing with my bestfriend, than gossipping on the computer with her. Also since people are more willing to say things not face to face, if you didn't go on the computer as much it would be easier and not as many arguments. In conclusion, I think that we shouldn't be on the computer as much because it 's very time consuming and wasteful, people need to be spending more time outside and exersizing to stay healthy, and finally, people should be talking more face to face because it would build a better relationship. So please listen to my pleading, People need to stop spending so much time on the computor, for all of these reasons and many more."	1995	
1996	1	"To whom @CAPS6 my concern, I think computers are great to have in socity. I believe this because @CAPS6 allows you to talk to your friends. Share information with relatives far away and lastley @CAPS6 tells you about local news and weather. I will explain this more if you read on. First of all did you ever get out of school and say ""I was supposed to tell someone something""? I know I have. With computers you can see if your friend was online and instant message them on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Also if you live in a large town and there is more than one school you can meet some one that goes to a different school, and stay in touch with them. This is good because you can make more friends. I rember when I was a littler kid and met this kid from pre school if I had a computer I could of still known that kid but I don't anymore. Second of all if you have family or friends far away from you or even in a differnt country you can stay in touch with them. this is helpful when they have mybe a baby they can send you pictures of @CAPS6. For example when I was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 my cusin @CAPS3 moved to @CAPS4. He had a baby boy and he emailed my family in @CAPS5 pictures of him. If we did not have computers I would of never seen him till they come to visit. Lastley computers keep you in touch with local news and weather. This is great because I would know if there was a forrest fire in @LOCATION1. If you say you can whatch the news and weather on tv your right and wrong. What happins if you have a broken tv or even if you missed the new program and @CAPS6 wont be on a couple of hours. I rember when @CAPS6 was @NUM3 oclock in the @TIME1 and @CAPS6 started pooring rain and my mom was flying in. I went on the computer to look if @CAPS6 was passing. I never would of know if she could fly into the air port if idident have a computer. In conclution you can see the computer is one of the best tools you can own. I say this because you can talk with your friends, get information from far away family and friends. Lastley you can check local wether and events. I hope this esay changed your mind about computers beining bad."	1996	
1997	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are some of the reason way I think computers are good for people who live in other states can keep in context with there family. Another is it can help you with when your at work. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 a high school in @LOCATION1 who works with computers everyday. @CAPS1 are my three reasons way computers are not just good there helpful. First keeping in context with your family. Say a family member move to @LOCATION2 you haven't talk to them in days, then a death pops up in the family its his grandma. He has no phone but they do have a labtop you can @CAPS2-mail him or her. Then they can come down to the funerl and share his or her memory of there grandma. that a key reason way computers are good for you. Second, when people go to work, they sometimes need a computer to help them plan meets have lunchs, and maybe even partys. Teachers use the for puting grades in it then find the total grade for the marking period. I hate to say this but you cant lie you guys probadly use them too. That another great reason why computers helpful. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 good school. But they made there whole school around computers. Students get to know what homework is by there computers. Also classes when there in art class it helps. then at the end of the day you got to take it home and keep throughout the school year. That a good thrid reason why computer helpful. Those three reason explain why computers are helpful and they don't have a effect on people. One you type need for staying in context with family. Second you need them for work. lastly, students need them at @ORGANIZATION1 for classes, homework, and others. @CAPS1 are way computers don't effect the community they help the community. "	1997	
1998	1	"Dear Newspaper, A lot of people are talking about if having computers effects are society. In my opinion, I somewhat think that's true. @CAPS6 just seens people spend a lot of time on the computers. And this is effecting are society because this can lead to life changing conditions, @CAPS6's stopping us to live a healthy life, and @CAPS6 impacts your body. My first reason was that @CAPS6 can lead to life changing conditions. And what I mean by that is sevarl sites on the computer contain graphics, and flashs. And my next door neighbor's son @PERSON2, always went on the computer. And in a result he had a seizure. @CAPS6's reala sad, but @CAPS6 happened, now seizures became part of @PERSON2's life... That's something you @MONTH1 want to take in considerations. Another thing I thought was that @CAPS6 was stopping us from living a healthy life. Nutrition expert @PERSON1, quoted: ""I use to be fat, I always hated exercising, and two of those reasons was because of playing videogames and staying on the computer. And those two things prevented me from living healthy. Ten years later I lost some weight because I was committed to stop playing games and stay off the computer. "" In my opinion this says a lot. Finally my last reason about computers is that @CAPS6 really impacts your body. Going on computers no exercise, and no fresh air builds a bad habit. @CAPS6 means your @CAPS1-A-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! and @CAPS6 really does change your personality. I took a quick little surevey. @CAPS6 said of @CAPS5 that don't have jobs, but have computers in household. The computers makes us @CAPS4 enough that we can't even apply for a job... this needs to be a wake-up call. Concluding this I think having computers are okay but having too much isn't. I know the debate would still be going on. But I just wanted you guys to know were I am on @CAPS6. Remember what I said, @CAPS6 can lead to life-changing conditions its stopping us from trying to live a healthy life, And @CAPS6 really impacts are body. I recommend you guys read this again."	1998	
1999	1	"In todays technology filled world, using computers is a growing among us. Everyday computers gather and give endless amount of information like an international school at your home. While many people embrace computers as a much needed things in their abodes, others disagree and compromise. I write to you the local Newspaper for you to agree with me that computers good effects on people. I have three reasons to support this. First it helps increase hand-eye coordination to people who use them. Second, computers give others the ability to gain knowledge on knowing people and places. Lastly computers let people talk to others through computers. Now, I will begin to elaborate. Have you never been a good better at a game of baseball? or been a good passer in basket ball? As surprising as it @MONTH1 seem to the ones who do not know one way to improve hand-eye coordiantion through the usage of computers. Now, just using computers for typing won't grow you the skills to get you @ORGANIZATION1 best these are programs and games that, with today's technology can improve ones hand-eye coordination. For example the army would use computes simulation to train soldiers hand-eye coordination and then mandatory survival skills for when they go to. It is also plausible to any profesional athletes. Computer simulation gives edges and with that go to my next reason. Since now first thought of it, @CAPS1 aid older techniques such s were not reliable. So think computers to get the use need to the for without computers wouldn't know what happen to haiti for. But with computers had fully destroyed the total cost of damageand know help dy. So computers are good when it comes down. Computers are also great for the ability to with through a wide range of programs and websites. This is for because if one websites to speak to friends and family not see them they would still talk one time, my dad even to see relatives but didn't go. Use both computers skype we still stayed. In conclusion computers are great for hand-eye coordination keeping on other countries and staying in to with family or friends."	1999	
2000	1	"Dear newspaper writer, In the late @NUM1 people had created the @CAPS1 I had studied that lots of People loss eye site, The people became obeised, and enjoying life. Read on and I will explain to you @CAPS3 these @CAPS1 realy effect lots of people. My @CAPS2 reason, @CAPS3 I think that Computers effect people @CAPS8 because people have loss their eyesite from the computers because your eyes caint look at one thing @CAPS14 like three hours. @CAPS14 example doctors had continuesly had told paticants that @CAPS4 you look at a @CAPS5 close you can loose eyesite a @CAPS5 and a @CAPS1 are the same thing because they both can watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6. more and more people will begin to loose their eye site. This needs to stop. My @CAPS7 reason @CAPS8 that lots of people are not enjoying reality because @CAPS1 become addictive because they make new games and websites every month and its hard to stop playing on the @CAPS1. I remember like two months ago they had this new game on @CAPS9 called @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and you @CAPS27 to play with people from around the world and that game was @CAPS13 but then I was playing the oneday @CAPS14 shops @CAPS15 and dinner and instead I ate @CAPS16 I play my game. I gained @NUM2 pounds that week @CAPS17 I new something wast rite. @CAPS17 I decided not to play on game hangout. that its better being outside then sitting many hours and playing on the @CAPS1 all day. This @CAPS8 @CAPS3 lots of people @CAPS27 @CAPS18 and to help them by banning computers @CAPS14 awhile. My third reason @CAPS8 that people @CAPS27 viriuses! on the Computers or @CAPS19 into the Computers and @CAPS27 all your data like creditcards billing information and even find out where you live. A long time ago I heard that there were alot of viriuses that People had sended to a @CAPS1 and stole all their personal @CAPS20. @CAPS17 @CAPS4 you @CAPS27 a @CAPS1 that's @CAPS22 going to happen and you would have to pay like every month @CAPS23 @CAPS17 that you will prevent viriuses thats alot. This needs to stop all it does @CAPS8 bring @CAPS25 to your Family, This needs to stop. Know @CAPS26 I got your attention I need your help and all the people who does aprove of my opinion need your help support too. These are my three reasons again. One @CAPS8 that people loose their eyesite, @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that lot people aren't enjoying reality and final reason @CAPS8 that people @CAPS27 viriuses on the @CAPS1."	2000	
2001	1	"Dear: Local Newspaper I think computers are really good for people to use because you can learn a lot about everything. Computers help people on their jobs and in everything it helps kids with there homework and thats really good you can buy stuff using the computer so you won't have to go anywhere. Computers help people pay their bills and stuff using a computer you can check out anything you want to know about or anyplace you want to see and it gives you directions to go places and stuff. Computers help you go to any website and it gives you any information you want or that you need thats really good and when people shop on line is less than if you go to the store thats why a lot of people shop on line because is less money. Kids use computers to play video games with friends and you can talk on the computers with friends and family. Computers are really good help to people because if you want to go anywhere buy anything or pay bills. You can use the computer to do all that stuff. Kids use it to do school work like projects and stuff it helps them save their work so they won't lose anything. People order anything they need thats really cool. Teachers learn something new using the computer and they help kids learn new things. Kids use the computers to go on like @CAPS1 and stuff they can wach music videos talk to friends and play video games. People can even use computers to make music and to cool stuff. People use computers to get music live ituns and videos, movies and games on like an ipod. I think computers are really good they can do anything you want you can go in any website and stuff you can find a lot of information that you need for like a job or school work people should kee using computers they can do anything you need and they help a lot."	2001	
2002	1	"I not believe computers have a good effect on people. They have bad effects on people and are over used. They are like this for some reasons. They make people spend less time exercising, the outside world, and even time with family and friends so if we keep on using computers like this it will hurt us. Firstly, people are using computers an increasing rate and studies show the more people use computers the less there exercise. And with less people exercising it will add to the problems @CAPS1 @CAPS2 with ability. I would say about half the kids in my school are over weight and when look back pictures of the eight grade from years ago there had half as many obese or over weight students because computers either weren't around or used to much. And statistics show that people to be a lot healtier than those without. So us a result computers are anything but beneficial becomes they mate people less time exercising. Secondly, with people using computer so much they dont enjoy nature as much as they should. Statictics show that people who spend at least a hour outside a day are not only healtier, but here higher test scores. And if less people go outside and enjoy nature, less people will see it significant. For example a recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who dont go outside everyday are less to. And that means the more people use the computer the more on earth there is going to be. So as a conclusion computers are not beneficial because they make people spend less time enjoying nature. Lastly, computers take away from time that people can spend with friends and family. It's very important to spend time with family. For example statistics show that of people who are in preson didn't have good relationship with there families. and another study showed that students have @PERCENT2 better grades if they spend at least @NUM1 hours there families a as a computers are not beneficial they time your family. Computers in no way are beneficial could do better things like exercise, enjoy nature or even spend time with love ones. So I urge you do not use computers so much and do other things because."	2002	
2003	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern on the local paper, I firmly believe that computers are the best invention since the telephone and cars! They allow people to stay in touch with the world around them. They even have thousands of typing games and ""how to's"" for you to strengthen your skills. These great inventions allow people to keep in touch in a whole new and much more efficent way. The world isn't like it used to be. People come from all different place around the world and they often forget the most important thing about them, their roots. Not knowing your own culture is like not knowing the other half of you. Luckily, computers have the ability to allow you to find out about your ancestors and what kind of people they were. It also allows you to learn about other cultures in far away places. Suppose you are going on a family trip to @LOCATION1. Wouldn't you want to know the types of clothes they wear, foodds they eat, weather climates, currency? I certenly hope so. How embarrasing would that be not to know any history anout the country you're visiting? As I noted before the world is changing all around us everyday. There are new inventions, government, ideas, statistics, ect just to name a few. I personally think it's truely horrid to deprive people of what is happening in the world around us. Computers can solve this problem in a matter of seconds! People ofteb complain that computers are hard to work or they just don't have the skills to work it. However, there is a solution that millions have overlooked on the internet. Here are hundreds of thousands of games and softwares that enable you to learn any of the skills you could possably need to work a computer. It's truely amazing how rapidly you pick up the skills of hand-eye coordination and typing. These are two extremely important skills every person needs to be successfull in life. And computers offer that to you. I think it is clear that communication is the key to human nature. Computers have multiple ways for people to communicate quickly and efficiently. You can talk with friends, family and work. People often lose friends they used to have due to simple lack of communication. With computers this problem is saved and you are instantly reconnected with them. It is obvios to everyone we are in a bad economy. This means that anyone's job is at stake everyday. If you miss a deadline because you didn't know when it was you can lose your job instantly. However, with computers you can easily ask someone when the due date is. For all my reasons above, I can honestly say that computers are a neccesity in today's world. if you want to lose your culture, connection with people and life long skills, then you'll never get to be successful. Think about it. Do you?"	2003	
2004	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4's, and @ORGANIZATION2. These are all different brand names for computers. All @ORGANIZATION1 these wonderful divises can help you, the everyday @CAPS5, communicate with people that you would never expect to. You could easily make a friend over in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4! @CAPS11 you are writing to your good friend in @LOCATION4, you are using the keyboard to type. If you become experienced enough, like my sister @CAPS6, you can even type without lookindg at the keys. This hand-eye coordination can help you in many things outside @ORGANIZATION1 the computer world. @CAPS10 you come home from school and you have a boat load @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS7 homework, the computer can help you finish that homework and learn about far-away places too. Wouldn't it be wonderful to take a trip to @LOCATION2 and see the @LOCATION1 and the @ORGANIZATION1? With a computer you can go to all @ORGANIZATION1 those places without leaving the comfort @ORGANIZATION1 your home. @CAPS10 you, reader are reading about @LOCATION4, you will find out that they have different views on what is sociallly acceptible and what isn't. @CAPS10 and if you go to @LOCATION4, you can already be ahead @ORGANIZATION1 the curve. How annoying would it be to get all A's on your report card except for that one lousy @CAPS8 on in @CAPS7? It would be terrible right? Well no more. One out @ORGANIZATION1 every four people who do their homework with the aid @ORGANIZATION1 the computer get better scores on quizes and tests. What about talking to your friends @CAPS11 you are doing your homework to ask them a question; wouldn't that be great? I love my camp friends. I love them more than my own siblings, but I don't get to talk to them much during the year. With computers that all changed. I know that some people think that kids should go outside more and be with their family lets get realistic,what family wants their teen around anyway? They are moody and unplesent. ""@CAPS10 my child will have a homework question,"" my mother says. ""I would want them to have the flexability to e-mail their teacher and ask them."" @CAPS11 all @ORGANIZATION1 your children are type, type, typing away they are learning valuable hand-eye coordination. Baseball, tennis, football, lacross and many other sports require a mountain @ORGANIZATION1 hand-eye coordination. Catching a ball or hitting it requires a lot @ORGANIZATION1 skill and practice and that is wear typing comes handy. I am sure you know this reader, but most teens can type without looking down to see what they are doing. Some people think that they, teens, are just being lazy and not getting enough exersize, but with the boat-load @ORGANIZATION1 homeworks, how can they. (That is a whole another story.) @CAPS12, @CAPS12, @CAPS12. That is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 letters being pushed down on the keyboard @ORGANIZATION1 computers everywhere. It is also the sound @ORGANIZATION1 communication. The sound @ORGANIZATION1 the world becoming one continent instead @ORGANIZATION1 seven. It is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 learning about other people's culture and what is important to other people. It is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 hand-eye coordination that will make the next @CAPS13 @PERSON2 or the next @PERSON1. It is the sound, dear readers, @ORGANIZATION1 learning."	2004	
2005	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I am writing this letter to inform you on my opinion, on the effects computers have on people. I do not agree with the idea of computers because, people spend way too much time on them. Some people aren't who they say they are (which creates a danger zone for many!) @CAPS1 there are many who @MONTH1 go on the computer for inappropiate matters. Hopefully by the end of this letter, you will very much agree with me. My first reason of thinking is because, people spend way too much time on computers. Which could get in the way of reality with them. Enstead of going outside for a walk or even to play... people are rushing home for what? Computers. Enstead of going home to do homework students rush to go on the computer. The computer can and will distract people from their responsibilities. Before you know it, your whole life will resolve around computers. Then there's people who complain about their weight! So go on and excerise, go outside and be active! But no... they go and go on the computer. When just sitting there, and gaining wait without even knowing. Secondly, some people don't stick with their true identity. They're not who they say they are! And this is a major problem, exspecially with chat rooms. It creates a danger zone for all, exspecially with young kids. Someone could lie and say they're your age... but they're not! Then try to become your friend, and before you know it they wana meet you in person! But what for? Most people dont think about that, they're just so happy & excited they got a new friend. Or this new guy that says he's your age and always complementing you. Before you even know it you become the person all over the news and newspaper known as ""@CAPS2"". Finally, there are many people who go on the computer for a more inappropriate things! This can become a problome with young kids and grownups. Same for nute pictures and even some for poronogrephy. Some are ""under age"" and some are ""overage"". Either way, thats just discousting to me! These kind of things shouldn't even be allowed on the computer at all. And people who have an addiction to these kind of things, the computer won't help... its just feeding them... making them worse. In conclution, now you have read and hopefully understand my reason of thought. Because of how much time people spend on it, some people aren't who they say they are, and @CAPS1 using and abusing the computer for inappropriate reasons."	2005	
2006	1	"Hey! Do you like computers? I understand the issue about what effects computers have on people. I think computers help people educational and socially. Computers help you make new friends, computers can teach you many things, and computers help people educationally. Computers help you make new friends. I made over @NUM1 new friends on the computer. They all are very kind people. Some are fun to talk to and others are fun to play games with online, like checkers. Computers can teach you maty things, Computers can teach people many cultures and about different countries. Without computers some people probably won't know as much about other countries or cultures. Computers also teach us about history. If there are no computers we probably won't learn as' much about history as you do in school. Computers help people educaionally. Don't you want a good education? computers teach us math. Soical studies, and many more subjects. I think computers are very helpful. Computers help you make new friends, computers can teach you many things, and computers help people educationally. Please take my opinions seriously! Computers have good effects on people!"	2006	
2007	1	"Whats your opinion on how computers affect peoples lives? I agree that it really does affect our lives for thse three reasons they start to gain alot of weight. they don't go outside as much, and they dont spend alot of time with there family. If people spend all there time being on the computer they'll gain alot of weight then wonder why. Its because they don't get out the house and excercise enough or maybe not at all. For example my dad use to do that all the time, they one day he realized he was gaining alot of weight. So what did he do, he started to work out alot more. He's still on the computer all the time but he excercises in between. Us humans need fresh air come in a while. For our bodies to function the way there suppose to. But how is that suppose to happen if you stay at home on the computer and don't go outside. I ounce heard on to that if your body doesnt get the fresh air that it needs that you'll get used to the costaphobic air in your house. That's not good either. You'll probaly start to forget what day it is, what month cause you spend your time on the computer all day."" @CAPS1 my mother. If you spend all of your time worring about myspace. @CAPS2, and aim you'll forget about the important things in your life. Your family. I think is way better than myspace, @CAPS2, and aim. ""I say cause you could get tired of all those things but you never get tired of your family. Your family will start to fell that the computer is way better then them and it shouldn't be that way. Spend time with your family go places with them parly. Play board games with them. Cause remember you can replace. Myspace, @CAPS2, and aim but you cant replace the people that love you and care for you which is your family. In conclusion you should think about it. If you agree with my three reasons you start to gain weight, don't get enough fresh air, and don't send alot of time with your family. But after your done reading my essay i hope you change your mind and agree with me. Your life is way more important than being on the computer all day."	2007	
2008	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a big role in our daily lifes. They are important and we leave it to them to do a lot of our work for us. Ther is such thing as being smart about using your computer. There is also over abusing the time we spend on it. But computers can't be taken away from us, we just got to use them wisely, and these are some of my reasons @CAPS1 reason I think we are affected by computers is because it actually helps out our environment. Going on the computer to do work. And it also alows us to pay our bills. This is a big ordeal. If we use computers more to do this stuff we will help out our environment by not using as much paper. Just imagine, people won't need to worry about wild life as much just because of a computers? Well, yeah it is just doing bad for us if we are on it @NUM1 but im pretty sure if we limit our time from the computer we will make a change! Secondly, in school or at our jobs we might get a book that was published in @DATE2. It is now a new century, and not everything is up to date. Computers always have the latest news. I believe they will now only help us with the knowledge over @DATE1. But computers will inform us on not just whats going on in our state but whats going around the world today. They help us and reminds us on now. We should change and make our world a better place. Lastly, I think computers are a important thing because we don't only see whats going on with people and stuff, but we can also interact with them. As kids we like to meet new people and over the computer is a great way. This can help us practise communicating with people. As long as youre not on it @NUM1. But we are teenagers what do you expect. teens are all down for meeting now people. As long as we are safe with it. That is another reasong I think computers help us. I think computers are a possitive way to help our environment. Thank you for taking the time to hear my side."	2008	
2009	1	These are reasons people should support advances in technology computers are good way to keep in touch with friends that move or family that live for away. In the current job market you have to learn how to work a computer. Computers are very useful if you know how to use it correctly. When it comes down to it. It's their choice. Wether they go out to play or stay inside. You can say anything you want to people if they don't want to something they're hot going to. Those were my reasons.	2009	
2010	1	"Dear newspaper writers, Have you ever used a computer and learned of a way that it improves your day and makes life more interesting? Well, if you have, then you have had a taste of how computers benefit society. I use a computer to help me keep track of which of my favorite producs are being made and i can even watch my favorite shows on the computer. Computers can also help inother ways beyond watching shows and finding out about newly released iems. For instance, they teach hand-eye coordination every time you use the mouse. also, plenty of websites give information about faraway places and other people, and i bet you guys use almost @NUM1 of those websites. Lastly, communication on the web is a major part of people's lives. Just read on, and i'll tell you more about the wonder of computers! First of all, hand-eye coordination improvement is a major issue with computers.I used to have little to no coordination, but now, after using computers, I can use my sense of touch and sight to do anything, even with my bad hand. You must it forget all of the helpful and even fun computer programs made for the sake of teaching coordination. I remember a program hat tought me how to easily type letters on the computer without moving my hand around. I only know of two other hand-eye coordination exercises, and they are playing difficult video games for hours and hours and boring physical exercises that don't really help. So, basically, computers are the best way to help your eyes and hands work together. Also, if you want, you can search for info about faraway places such as @LOCATION1, and people such as the man who invented the sandwitch. For example, i recall a time when i had to make a poster for @PERSON1, and i searched on the internet for a icture and information about him, as well as where his @DATE1 championship took place. There also a program called @ORGANIZATION1 which someone to se every inch of our planet. @PERCENT1 of americans use the computer to get their information on people and places. There are some pieces of information that are found on the computer that can't be found in a book. These are some of the reasons that a computer is the best place to get information. Lastly, communication on a computer is fun, and sometimes a necessity. This reminds me of a time when i wrote a letter on the internet to my favorite company about the upcoming robocop movie, and they actually responded to my letter. There is a website called myspace.com which is used for introducing people to other people. There have been instances of communication over the web where people would be hunted or killed after telling the stalker their name and adress, and that is why new privacy systems are made all the time. Before i forget, there are two computer games made for socializing and having fun at the sametime: @CAPS1 of warcraft and second life. Communicating on the internet doesn't just benefit society, it connects it, too. I hope that this letter better helps you understand how important computers are to society. Computers have special ways of helping people learn hand-eye coordination. Information is easily found and in great quantities on the internet. Lastly, the web brings thousands of people together almost everyday. The computer actually helps people live their lives. If they were bad, @PERSON2 wouldn't still make them. Please, make the right decision and support computers the way i do."	2010	
2011	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 the computer have too much of an impact on our lives? I don't think it @CAPS2, because it is used for so many good causes. One of them is that you can learn things about places you have never heard of. Another one is that you can interact with other people. Also, you can do some online shopping. Beleive it or not the computer isn't all games and facebook. There are other websited that you can learn about things on place and religions that you have never even heard of. Also there are other websited that people write article that tell us about current wars. Other websites can tell us news about celebrities, terrerists, and the presidednt. I know that the computer has a possitive effect on people. Next we have interaction, with the use of a computer you can interact with people from your school, friends, or even cousins. We can do this because we have webcams and internet sites that let you talk to your friends. I know I'm on the computer and I video chat with my cousins and friends. It helps make plans and keep in contact with your family or friends. Also their is a microphone that will let you talk to other people! Trust me computers definetly have a possitive effect on people. We can also use the computer to go shopping. Like I know stop and shop has a peapod delivery system, because say you are really sick or you are elderly and you don't want to come out of the house today you can just go online and pick out your food. Also there is a lot of online book stores, say you really wan't this one book but your local book store doesn't have it you can order it online. Also there are just some essential house goods that any store around doesn't have, you can go online and buy them. And last but not least, clothes. Say you are walking through some stores and you find this beautiful top but you don't have enough money to buy it, you can always go online and find the shirt and it migt be cheaper. The computer has so much possitive effects on today life. So, @CAPS2 the computer have a good effect on life today? Yes! We could go shopping. We could learn about current events that are happening today. Also, we can communicate with others. The computer doesn't just have a possitive effect but it also fun. Now you can go and make a bette decision on if the computer has possitive or negative effects on people. "	2011	
2012	1	"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 and I think computers are a great thing. Three reasons why I think this are: you can learn, people can communicate, and they very fun to use. Hopefully by the time you finish reading, you will also think computers are great and have good effects. While visiting places is great, learning about places is even better. Anyone can surf the web and find tons of facts about anything. Say you wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but your budget was tight. Use the web. There are tons of videos, facts, pictures, and other things on @ORGANIZATION1 world. You still @MONTH1 not be able to ride rides or play games there, but at least you can get a good feeling about @ORGANIZATION1. Also, anyone can learn about other countries! Millions of facts on any country or state no matter where it is. You could even talk with people from around the world, which brings as to @CAPS2 next point. Communication is key. Especially in this day, it is very important to talk and socialize. There are many messaging systems that can be used to communicate. AIM, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION2 are just few of e-mail and instant messaging systems. It @MONTH1 take days to get mail to other countries via air-mail. But with e-mail, messages are sent in mere seconds. Also, video chatting is on the rise. If you can't visit someone, then talk through video. You can see and hear each other the entire time. Even though they are almost @NUM1 miles or more away, you can still meet them face-to-face. Boy, all this computer talk sure is fun. Seriously though, computers are very fun. You can go onto game sites or play solitare or even pinball. No more going out to the arcade and spending your parents pay checks. The games are free (depending which website) and, for the most part, fun. But wait, there's more! Are you older and don't like video games and other games? Then watch videos. Need on update on the news but it is long before @LOCATION2 news is on? Then go to a news website. YouTube is also great for videos. Funny, sad, or dramas are all part of the ""tube"" community. So have fun and keep your wallets full. Well, I have told you three reasons why computers are good and have great effects on people. If you still aren't buying it, then get this last reason: the price. As I talked about in previous segments, the cost is low. If you keep the computer well maintained, you can get great things out of it. Some computers can get very high in price, but the average is low. Around @MONEY1 to @MONEY2 on average. So you see, computers are great and have very good effects on people. If you don't believe me, then go out and try one yourself. I am sure you will love it."	2012	
2013	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was come to my attention that, although computers are helpful, some people believe are taking more from society than giving. I disagree with this statement. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help us learn, and allow us to talk to others. Computers are quite helpful to the modern person. Computers allow us to develope many skills at an early age. Many games are now made for computers to help teach small children hand-eye coordination. The games @MONTH1 include hitting a ball in virtual baseball to using a hammer and nails virtually. Many experts say children that develope these skills online are more capable on the real world. In fact studies have shown over @PERCENT1 of children that play educational games exibet well developed, fine motor skills at an early age. This could mean that soon the young people of society will learn faster in sports and develope an interest in playing games outside. While young children are developing motor skills teens and adults are reasearching. Many teens use the internet as reasource, I know I do. Teens often must do reports for multiple classes. Not many students have the time to go to the also they are reasearching or. We are often being with sports, younger siblings or but the internet is! Most teens prefer the orignal program will. They find @CAPS2 and you can buy many online now. This saves, to power machines to the. The human millions calling down to which. We could of their. Humans @CAPS3 and the internet will help the. The internet also allows people to talk to one another. This allows people to share pictures, opinions and assignments. Many adult like @NUM1 share pictures of when they were younger with friends and family. By converting pixels into @CAPS4 you can e-mail, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or share via so web-page. Opinions are also shared. Many people have discussions over issues they feel are pressing, such as the rain forest or fossil fuels. Many people pursuade others this way, or form groups about this concern. Teens also use the internet for school work. If student forgets some thing they can ask a friend to fax @CAPS2 over or remind them what page the assignment was on. This is very helpful because if prevents failing grades and bad report cards. I hope my letter has informed you about the many ways computers are helpful. They teach hand-eye coordination, help us learn about the world around us, and allow people to talk about important issues."	2013	
2014	1	"Dear, to whom it @MONTH1 concern I have @NUM1 different but similar opinion on how computers can effect people. One opinion is that they can help you trying to find things on the computer. Second reason is because you can enhance your hand-eye cordination and my last reason is that you can learn new thinks by playing educational games. My reason us that they can help you find thing that you and not know about and they can help you because if you have a biography report you have to do for school and they dont have a book on that person you can look it upon the computer the give you so many sorces to choose from but if you did the book only gives you one resource to choose from. My second reason for how computers effect people is that it gives them hand eye cordination which you really need in anyway which can help uou later in hand eye cordination is a great reason is become you will be able to computer same time. My last reason how computer effect people is that they can off how to get know it there website were you are such in subject our doing help you grom so that you can become better and get good grades on test. In conclusion I think that computers have a great effect on people from the reasons listed above which were help you learn something secondly enhane hand eye cordination and to get a better education. I hope this help you alot and you agreed to it"	2014	
2015	1	"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, In the computer beneficial controversy I am standing @CAPS2 computer. People of all ages use these machines. The majorally for reasons benefiting them many very from kids just old enough to read to the just forgeting new. Many parents wonder nowadays whether sites should be enough to let their socialize and civilice on them. But the majority of childrens sites and cd-rom games are their young minds to adapt early to a world filled with knowledge and learning. Childen can learn oh so another reason to be @CAPS2-computers is because people of any age cn hop on the old internet and a journey of learning ! New people, new culture, anything like. a moments passing you could have all the information you could went at your fingertips. Who could ever think to try to live without their social networking site? Sites such as facebook, myspace, @MONTH1 have their down falls but they are great texts for connecting distant. former class co-workers even catching up with old friends. So before you think about putting computers consider the good also. There is so much more. Thank you."	2015	
2016	1	"Dear local Newspaper, Computers have a possitive effect on people. Firstly, you learn new information using the @CAPS1. @CAPS12, you can use the computer to communicate with other people. Finally, you usually find work using a computer. First of all computers have a positive effect on people because people can use the computer to learn new information. Firstly, there are web sites on the computer that post informative articles on the @CAPS1. @CAPS7 you want to learn something new about the world or just about anything else you can look on the computer. @CAPS12, @CAPS7 you are looking for information for just one subject, you can easily find that too. For examples, a web site like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 just has you type in a subject and it finds articles about it for you. Lastly you can probably learn something by just searching on the web. Professor @PERSON1 of @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS6 says, ""@CAPS7 you spend just five minutes looking through the @CAPS1 chances are you will learn something new."" Computers have a possitive effect on peope beacuse they can learn new information. @CAPS12, computers have a possitive effect on people because you can use the computer to communicate with other people. Firstly, you can be in a @CAPS10 room with anyone around the world in one of these @CAPS10 @CAPS11. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS8 @CAPS1 use of @CAPS10 @CAPS11 says ""oproximatly one million people from all around the world log on to @CAPS10 @CAPS11 everyday to talk to other people."" @CAPS12, you can use the computer to write a letter or type literature. For example, you are writing an important letter to your friend, but your pen or pencil break. You can type it on the computer instead. Lastly, @CAPS7 you have something important (anything) and you want share it with the world, all you have to do is use the computer to make a web site. In a resent study on overage every web site on the @CAPS1 is viewed at least twice a day, many people are bounded to see your web site. Lastly, computer have a possitive effect on people because you can easily find work using a separate. Firstly, you can find job lists or companies offering jobs on the computer. For example you just got fired from a job its not for bad because you can just find another job online. @CAPS12, some people get paid by typing or posting things on the computer. in a recent study @PERCENT1 of jobs today involve working on a computer. Lastly, you can stay a home while you work on the computer. Learning new information on the computer, communicating through the computer, and using the computer to find work are all reasons why computer have a possitive effect on people. Millions of people use the computer everyday, would you, the local newspaper, want to tell them it is not good for them?"	2016	
2017	1	"Dear @CAPS1, (Local Newspaper) I believe that computers have far more negative effects on people than their positive effects. One major problem w/ computers is that they could make their users spend less time w/ family. Also, they could arise in an addiction, ( to the comp.) @CAPS2, there are quite more ""productive"" things to do instead of being on the computer. Family is a very important factor in life, along w/ friends. We all need family & friends to spend time with. The time we spend w/ family & friends should be thought of as precious because they won't always be around. So, why waste this time on the computer when it could be spent w/ the ones you love? When you go on the comp. for a while your friends & family are probably missing hanging out w/ you or just having you there. My mother only allows me to go on the computer for @NUM1 hour, at most, each day. She says that is so I can spend time w/ herself & my family. She is right because we only have them for so long so we should use that to our advantage. This leads me into my next topic. An addiction is something that you live, breathe & can't live w/o. Usually addictions are bad. An addiction that is getting worse in people throughout the years is a computer addiction. @CAPS3. @PERSON1 says ""A recent study shows the @PERCENT1 of teens spend more than @NUM2 hours a day on the computer & of that, @PERCENT2 were just recently diagnosed w/ an addiction. This is bad, real bad."" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 is right. This is real bad. It needs to be stopped. I talked to a counciler the other day. She has about @NUM3 different people came to her a month & about @NUM4 of them are computer addicts! It @MONTH1 not seem like alot now, but @CAPS4 we don't stop this than soon the numbers & statistics will get out of control. Now, nobody wants that, do they? Also, being on the comp. far too long could result in eyesight problems, because you are staring @ the screen too long. To stop the rapidly increasing numbers of people who spend too much time on the computer we need to influence the people positively w/ healthier things to do. There are many other ""healthy alternatives"" to computers. You could go & exercise, or just hang w/ friends. My mom said to me once ""@CAPS4 you do healthier things now, it will definately help you in the long run."" I know it @MONTH1 sound dumb to kids, but it is true. Comps. also have an unhealthy influnce on kids because of the internet. Many things are innapproiate for young users, but they are not blocked. For example! AIM, people can say anything. Sure comps. are of great convinence, but life is not about convinence all the time. We need to relize that people could be spending more time w/ family + friends, we could have less addicts & that there are healthier alternatives to computers. So please would you help. We need to make this world a better place, this is a small step."	2017	
2019	1	"Dear newspaper writer's, I think that computer's are not so bad. I think the time you should use a computer is in the @DATE1 and be outside in the @DATE2. Computer's are good because you can learn many things about different country's diffent equipment and technology and about the kind. You also can stay in contact with all you friends, send pictures and letter's to your friend's that live in different countrie's and state's. They could also help with your school work and projects. The outdoor's is very important to people. You need to get fresh air and get excercise. You need to stay active to stay healthy. Nobody like's sitting in the house all day. That is no fun. People should play an hour a day. I really don't see why people wouldn't want to, it is fun to be outside. People need computers though. It help's with there work, balancing money and putting information on it. It also help's with organizing their week like planner. It can tell people time day of the month and people in their life. Computer's are very handy to daily life and work. That is why computer's are important to every day life but make sure you get some fresh air and computer's are helpful to society."	2019	
2020	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is an argument going around debating whether computers benefit society, or whether they will destiny it. I think that computers have a negative and a positive side and shouldnt @CAPS2 people need to learn to divide @CAPS1 time so that they can excersize and use the computer in moderation. The @CAPS3 to having a computer one being that people will be able to talk with friends & family that do not live close to you. This would be a pro, or positive point, because if one were to completely stop communication over the internet some families will have no way to talk to one another. @CAPS2 if someone had a friend in @LOCATION2 and were suddenly forced to move to @LOCATION1 people would have a difficult time comminucating through because @LOCATION1 is @NUM1 hours behind so when it is @NUM1 oclock @CAPS4 @CAPS1, here it is @NUM3 oclock so most kids would be in school. Another pro would be that a lot of learning for children, the computer whether it be in of all of school. For example I have a @NUM4 year old cousin and she learns the alphabet and much @CAPS1 so the computer such as math, and some language were to stop using computers in one community of children will not be as The would be computers increase hand eye coordination. For example when children are brought to the want to teach hand-eye coordination and linked their babys that learning will be better at sports. The cons, or negative points, would be one is people are spending to much time on the computer and not excersizing. And a survey was taken at an obeisity clinic and @PERCENT1 of these people stated that when they should've been excersizing they were on the computer. Second is that families that live together are spending time on the computer instead of spending time together, this is destroying some families and even some friendships. People need to learn that computers have their pros and their cons. And that a person can't live their life on the computer or, in other words, computer's are good and bad. People just need to learn how to use them in moderation with everything society (outside of the computer) in their life."	2020	
2021	1	"Dear editor: I am writing on behalf of my fellow students as well as teachers. Once you finish reading this letter, I am confident you will agree that having computers can be a serious benefit. Three reasons I say this areas follows: increased work productivity, easier reasearch, and more learning within a household. My first reason for writing you is that on in home computer can increase work productivity. I remember a time when I had to write and I just could not get started. So I asked my mom if I could do it on the computer, and e-mail it to my teacher. She said yes and I worked on the paper using microsoft word. To make a long story short, I finished the paper in @NUM1 hour. So as you can see from my example, having a computer increases work productivity in most people. The second reason that having an in home computer is a benefit if easier research. Reasearch can be extremely hard when you work at a library. But with a computer, you can find information in a few minutes that would take hours to find at a library. Also the internet has no weight, so you could carry books worth of information in your laptop as it would never get any heavier. Also, the internet will exist as long as there are computers to access it, a will and rot. So as you can see, reasearch the computer can be a breeze. The third reason having a computer is helpful is that it can increase the pace at learning. Learning can be increased when information and work are official statistics of people learn faster a computer. So as it is clear to me as it probably is to you, having a computer can make learning easier. I hope how I have convinced you that owning a computer is a huge benefit."	2021	
2022	1	"I believe that the effects computers have on people is bad. One reason is that if you spend too much time on a computer you could have a bad posture from leaning over. Next, the computer keeps people from going outside and getting exercise. Lastly, the computer keeps people from doing things they need to do. You could have a bad posture from leaning over too much. When you are on a computer you want to be as close to it as you can, so you would hunch over to get a better view. When you are typing you would lean to see what you are writing. If you are on the computer hunched over too much it would become a habbit to always lean over, especialy when you walk. The computer can keep people from getting exercise and going outside. most children would go on the computer when they get home, instead of going outside to play. The computer has so many things to do or it wich temps children to go on all the time. It is one of the main causes that a large percentage of kids are overweight in the @LOCATION1. The computer keeps people from doing necessary things they need to do. A lot of kids will not do their homework because of the exercise time spent on the computer. People procrastinate either communicating with friends, playing a game or even shopping online wich is a major factor from doing important things. If there was no computer people would not be as tempted, therfore they would get on with their life and complete things that have to get done. The computer has a bad and unecessary effect on people. it gives people a bad posture keeps them from getting exercise and going outside. It also keeps people from doing things they to do. The computer is one of the main forters in children and also adults being overweight. Therfore the computer has bad impacts on people in society."	2022	
2023	1	"Computers are one of the most popular electronics; they can almost do anything! And along with that they also have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places, allow people to talk online, and even teach hand-eye coordination. They must affect people in a positive way considering everything they can do for us! When money's tight, and you don't have the time to travel. Where do you go to learn about new, but far away places? Most would go to the library, but why go when you could easily find articles within seconds rather than scan books for hours? The internet on the computer provides researches with millions of resources-much more than most libraries. Without lifting a finger, but instead a few clicks of a mouse you can find reliable articles and photographs from scientbists; or even basic description of areas from hotels. In other words, you can practically travel while staying in your computer seat! The ability to learn about far away places is enhanced in many ways just by logging on to the computer, which definitely has a positive effect on people. The computer isn't justb convenient for learning but also for talking! Overtime, many instant messaging systems have been created and risen to extreme fame, making it easy to stay in touch with old friend and distant relatives, its fast, and rather than burn up minnutes on a telephone, typing into most chatting programs is free. In addition, you can send files of any kind-music, pictures, documents-allowing computer users to get critical feedback on their work, or sharing interesting things in a way much more easily done than the telephone. Chating get the computer is just another way the computer has a positive on people. Lastly, yet interesting enough the computer touches hand-eye coordination. The actual holding of the mouse and the interaction with the observing of it on-screen benefits hand-eye coordination. Obviously this can help athletes (eith the night programming of course), but also ordinary people, our hands and eyes interact with almost every movement we make, so why deny the chance to improve? Computers not only have a positive effect on people, but more specifically their hand-eye coordination, too. The effect computers have on people has been under observation for years now, but despite the pessimistic opinions of others, it certainly does have a positive effect. COmputers are machines that, along with helping us learn, talk, and with hand-eye coordination, have a positive effect on people. They truly benefit us in more ways than we can count."	2023	
2024	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the controversy over wehther computers have a negative or positive affect on society heats up, I feel the need to express my well thought out opinion to enlighten the public. There is no doubt in my mind that this rapidly growing technology can make the entire @CAPS6 a better place. Utilizing access to the internet opens a whole new door of possibilities reading the quest for knowledge. Perhaps even more importantly, online programs such @CAPS3 @CAPS4, email, and @CAPS5 can using friends closer together strengthing there companionship so that it lasts a lifetime. Finally, the best part about computers is that they make the @CAPS6 smaller in theory, so that a conversation with your mom in @LOCATION1 is one click away. Although few people will admit it, the thirst for knowledge is one of the strongest human instincts and it shall never be quenched. Thanks to computers, it doesn't have to be. What would have taken of reading and searching to find a single answer a century ago, can now be done with the click a mouse on google. Knowing too much can never be a bad thing. I'm not that every person who has used used a computer is smarter than someone who hasn't, but I will say that proper utilization of this technology drastically increases the actual potential to learn. One of the classic arguements of someone who is anti-computers is that it diminishs your social life dramiticly. On the contrary, the social life of someone who often uses the computer is almost always going to be more prosperous. Online you can chat with friends about whatever you want. You can even chat with a group multiplying your friends, and since when is having to many friends a bad thing. Not only will you meet and make new friends, but these technological advancements will even furthur strengthen the that you share with your best friends, expanding the life span of these friendships to after college. When you have internet, there is no such thing @CAPS3 long-distance relationships because everybodies a click away. The @CAPS6 @CAPS7 web does just what the name implies. I connects the whole planet bringing families and cultures closer together. Just the other day I watched @CAPS3 a friend of mine with his grandmother in @ORGANIZATION1 through a video chat. Family members that would otherwise never meet are coming together thanks to computers. Cultures are also spreading around the @CAPS6 because of this advancement. Now that there are computers, the @CAPS6 is shrinking to a comfortable and convienient size. Computers will change not millions, but billions of lives for the better. Human beings will continue to develop stronger bads with fellow people @CAPS3 the @CAPS6 gets smaller. Having to really search to gain knowledge will be a thing in the past. Technology is the key to making our @CAPS6 a better place."	2024	
2025	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I also support advances in technology and belive that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help keep people @CAPS6 to date on the local @CAPS11 and/or weather alerts. They also let people from any place at any time commnicate. Finally a computer also has many cool apps at your disposale. I dont know about you but my parents never know whats happening in the world or even in their own town. When they got a computer it allowed them to learn about the latest @CAPS11 whenever they want. They learned about new things @CAPS1 @PERSON2 is doing to help the @LOCATION2. They also learned that @LOCATION1 won the gold medal in hockey @CAPS3 the @DATE1 winter olympics. Finally they were updated that a big storm was coming and to stay indoors. Thank goodness @CAPS3 that. Other people can learn new things about the world and more like communicating with friends. Did I say friends? I ment to say that a computer can also let you talk online with friends, family and just about anybody else who owns a computer. @CAPS3 people who dont have a home phone and can't afford a cell phone you can talk on the computer. Whether it be by email or I.m. Talking about I.ming if you have some urgent information that you have to tell someone immedetly then you can just @CAPS2 people. (@CAPS3 you older folks out there I.m means instant messeging.) @CAPS4 course anybody can make an email address as well and just talk to people using that too! A computer is a great way to communiate, learn, and it has lots @CAPS4 cool stuff to use. It's true a computer does have lots @CAPS4 cool and suprising tools or apps @CAPS3 you to use. A piece @CAPS4 software called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" is easy to use and nice to have. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" allows you to build and design houses, buildings and just about anything @NUM1-@CAPS9 online. I think thats awsome. We cant forget the magnifisent internet. One @CAPS4 the best inventions @CAPS4 man kind. The internet lets people look @CAPS6 anything from dinosaurs to the revelotionary war to @PERSON1. The interent is a place where you can learn stuff, teach stuff, post stuff and more! A computer has very complex things like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the internet but it also has simple accessories too. Like a calculator, a clock or even a virtual sticky note pad to write (I mean type) notes on. So dear local newspaper, thanks @CAPS3 taking the time to read my letter and understand that a computer teaches people a lot through the internet, allows people to talk to there friends whenever they want and finally it keeps people like my parents @CAPS6 to date on the @CAPS11 @CAPS4 the world. P.S. @CAPS4 course a computer will never get the cool, importat @CAPS11 that you local newspaper do!"	2025	
2026	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I beleive that computers have a positive effect on society. By using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordination, give others helpful information about far away people + places, you also are able to talk online @NUM1, send others pic, documents, videos, or just post them on a webpage. I think that computers are vital when it comes to improving our nation. Did you know that computers can offer rehab or just extra help for those in need. By using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordiation, or play learing games. Using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordiation because in order to click on things you must look at the button with your eyes and click on it with your hand. @CAPS6 is also computer softwares available that helps people learn. By using a computer we are capable of learning things about far away people and places. This is very useful because it enables people to become educated no matter where you are in the world. Using a computer does not cost much if you do not own one. Enyone can go for free. This is very helpful. By using a computer you are esily able to share your pic, documents, and videos. It is as easy as as few simple clicks, you can privatly send mesages to your friends using @CAPS3 or e-mail. OR you could post them on @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 sites. This is very useful in the fact that if you ever needed to reach someone in case of emergency you would be able to. Because of all of these reasons and more saying that computers are nessisary in the sense taht they are helpful, useful, and can improve our society for the better. Even though computers are wonderful you should always exercize everyday no matter what. USE COMPUTERS - @CAPS6 @CAPS7!"	2026	
2027	1	Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are good for this world because it lets people talk to other people around the world and to do important work. Another reason is that you can learn faraway places and you could learn about famous people and how they live and what they do for a living. If you need to do a project just go on a computer and look up what ever you need t due you project. If your bord and there nothing to do you could go and play some games or look up stuff. I know that computer can upset people because all of that technology and that computer playing video game and talking to friends then speding time outside and playing games outside and to explore nature.	2027	
2028	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 opinion on the effects computers have on other people are that... Well it's true that a lot of people do spend to much time on the computer but is that neceserily a realy bad thing. For instance what if you're in college and you have to write or type like a @NUM1 page essay on @LOCATION1. You hardly know anything on @LOCATION1. You have to spend most of the day on the computer researching about @LOCATION1 and it's history and typing it down. Do you think thats a wast of time don't you want to pass and have to redo the class agian. I know some other people don't use there computers like. Others use there computers to talk to people online. Like on myspace or facebook you might think thats a wast of time too but what if your walking around your town one day and see someone you were talking to on myspace your intrdouce yourself and then you guys become friends. What i'm trying say is computers aren't that bad.	2028	
2029	1	"The world is slowly becoming smaller and smaller. Not litteraly of course instead people are given the oportunity to learn, communicate and study other cultures. @CAPS2 would not be able to do this without computers. Computers help people because they teach hand-eye coordination, they give people the chance to learn and comunicate with foreign cultures, and they help the world technoligicly progess. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This is an extremely important skill to have in today's world. @CAPS2 must be able to type fast and precise to suceed from day to day. Afterall who wants an unifitiont, un-coordinated person as their buisness partner. Every time I go to school I realize something new has been upgraded or made technological, and us @NUM1 graders are expected to be able to figure out programs. Not only do computers help @CAPS1 succeed, it also helps children in poor countries to comunicate with the outside world. Computers help mankind because it gives children and adults rich or poor to communicate with other cultures. By doing this @CAPS2 are opening up whole to paths for every day children to branch out and find a productive career. It also teaches kids to be tolerant of diffrent ethnicities at an early age. Some people might say that computers are bad because they expose children to violence and poverty in other countries. However is that really a bad thing? All children eventually learn that there is more to life then their town so why is it bad to teach kids to be aware of dangers at a young age. A wise man once said, ""@CAPS2 have history @CAPS2 don't repeat ourselves"". Well that is exactly what @CAPS2 would be doing if @CAPS2 stop using computers. people would stay in their own town have no usterstanding of the outside world and live a mediocre life. is that the life you would want to be living? Computers take us for and beyond the limitations of man kind and they will stay that way. The future is now. It is time for exploration and advancement. Computers make this possible by giving people opportunities to advance, etc mans are born to suceed, so why settle for any thing less? "	2029	
2030	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I am writting to persuade you to belive that computes are good to have. Three reasons are they are helpfull. They are fun and they are good for people. First of all they are very helpfull. They are mhelpfull because you can learn about different places. For example you can learn about @CAPS1 earthquake if you don't have t.v. You can learn about @CAPS2 and what to do to help if you want. Another example, is that you can learn about people in far away places. For example, you can learn why people in africa there faces and put bones through there noses or lips. My last example is that it helps us under stand anything we want. For example you can learn how to do malgebra, or how to make . You can understand anything you won't if you go on a computer. Secondly, they are really fun. They are fun because you can play all sorts of games. For example you can play games mean games, games that suites you, you can even create. Another reason they are fun is that you can talk to people can by twitter. E-mail, aim, myspace, facebook and many different other ways. My last examples is that you can download and even print pictures. You can print pictures of any thing. For example you can print pictures or your best friend movie , animals and more things. Thirdly, computers can be good for you. They can be good for you by you can meet new people, you can get a new boyfriend, you can make new friends. For example if you are looking for a new boy friend or girl friend you can go on e-harmony. Lets date.com and many different websites. Another example uis that if you to promote your company or buisnes you can craete your own website. For example, my neighbor created a website for his buisness and now he is putting more buildings up all around the world. My last reason is that you ca skype this is good for you because if you have a family member that lives faraway you can use a skype can era to talk to each other even though you really far away. Those are my @NUM1 reasons why computers are good they can help, they are good, and they are fun."	2030	
2031	1	"Dear computer technology I think computers have a positive effect on people because computers tell you information that you need. Computers are good because it gives tips on which you wanna learn about. Also two years ago @PERSON1 a member of the computer company said, about @NUM1 people liked computers. People like computers because there's cool stuff that you can look at on the computer like sports, the wild, and the ocean. Also on the computer you can find out stuff that you didn't no about like what is happening right no which is earthquakes. People should use computers because if you are going vacation and you are going to @LOCATION1 and you don't no were your going you might can go on the computer and look it up on google or yahoo and they show you a map of were you wanna go to. Also you can see were to get a map the computer might show if print the map out on the computer or the computer might were you can get a map. Computers are good for you because if you wanna buy something and you don't kmow how much it cost the computer might how much it cost and were you can buy them at, you might a pear of sneakers, a jacket, a hat, a watch, a chain, or a couple shirts. People should use computers because if your in highschool or college and you need to get a job you can go on the computer and try an look for a job you might wonna go to the mall and work there the computer might show how hours you have to work if they higher you the job. But before they higher you to their job you need to show them that you are right for the job and you can show them that by coming to work on time and working very hard. People should buy computers. Computers cost a lot of money but they are worth it because you can do all kinds of things on the computer. On the computer you can look up basketball games and football games. Also you can look of stuff about animals if you want."	2031	
2032	1	"Imagine a world where there are both children and adults that are addicted to technology, especially computers, I heard some people talking about the wonders of computers and what they have done to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2, others think tha't computers are affecting peoples health, how social they are towards others, and there is any too much information about people. The effects of what technology (Computers) has done far out weighs the good or them. American's health rate has been dropping recntly due to obesity and computers are difenalely causin this tragic formality. Computers have formed people into homebodies that like to get information off of the computer that doesn't include themselves and they seen to be exersising less and less. This will cause @LOCATION1 great embarisment because even though @LOCATION1 is talented in technology. Americans will be sitting on the computers all day. Obviously, computers are affecting the health of people and they need to become more active. From experience, I known that computers are addicting and that the more you are on them the more you want to go back on them. Computers are causing a social gap in the @DATE1. This is because people are now communicating from facebook, twitter, ichat, instant messaging, and emails. People are ruining their relatioship's with others and aren't spending enough time with their families (Which soon could lead to anxiety, stress, and bad gradis). Computers are ruining relatioships that they have with their family and friends, @CAPS1 time, you are brainwashed with the wonders of the computers but you don't realize the effects of them. You @MONTH1 think that computers are greay because they have improved the information we are recieving, @CAPS2, sometimes too much information can be harmful. Google is a site with tons of information about people. This way, @CAPS3 and people that could hurt you easily could find where you are with the information the computers their have them liven information opens minds, too much information could lead you into trouble. Obviously, computers are harming the @LOCATION2 because they are causing bad health, Their rvining relationships, and they are giving out too much information. The effects of computers have far what they have done for us. What would you rather do?"	2032	
2033	1	"I support advances in technology fully. There are many enriching benefits that come from technology at our fingertips. As we all are witnessing, our nation, our world, are becoming more and more technologically advanced every day. Though some people believe computers take away from social interaction, they are the complete apposite and actually increase social interactions shouldn't you be proud that our work is advancing? I am. If you were born in the ninety's; eightie's even, you have been around computers or known of them, your whole life. We started off typing and playing games at the age of @NUM1, maybe even younger. And since then, computers/technology have become a big part of most of our lives. There are so many amzing things that you can do with technology, research, listen to music, play video games, have a blogs and much more, with we have a more advanced society. Nowadays if we forgot a school book at school, we can acces it online. Printer isn't working? E-mail. Relatives can't make it for thanksgiving? Videocalls. Technology provides many solutions to everyday obstacle. Where be without it? The growth and well being of our world depends on the growth of technology. Hospitals provide to everyone; new born young, teens and the hospitals are full of computers. Schools contain many devices and computers to ensure a safe and rich education. Some computers even give people the ability to talk. The advances are beneficial to the public and has many benefits to our society. Facebook is a booming online blog collection that is over-flowing with members. Mostly every teen has one and I, myself do too. Facebook is a place where it's possible to share pictures, videos, news and much more. It allows you to interact with people on the whole other side of the world and stay ""caught up"" with old friends, family and even people you haven't talked to for years. And facebook isn't the only example of online interaction, there are many more. Yes, some people could spend a little less time online, but you can't blame technology for people's laziness. As you can inquire from reading this, isn't technology a wonderful thing? It's at its peak of popularity and quality. And everyone is benefitting from it. Our nation depends on it. And our youth rely on it socially. Will you be the one to pull it down?"	2033	
2034	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers effect on people is positive, computers benefit people in many different ways because they cam teach people so many things and they are able to retreive basically any information you are looking for. In fact, a local citizen quoted, ""I love going online because I know @CAPS5's where I can find all @CAPS2 information and I can @CAPS4 rely on @CAPS5."" I do agree with her, @CAPS3 has been stated, I deeply believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they teach you hand-eye coordination, give people an opputunity to learn about far away places, and lastly, they allow people to chat online with friends or family. @CAPS3 i said before, a benefit from computers would be, hand-eye coordination. During elementary school students are taught how to type on keyboards by not looking at their hands and only the screen; therefore, students will be able to type much faster. Hand-eye coordination and being able to type fast will definitely benefit students @CAPS3 they grew older and begin to type long essays or however   @CAPS4, now a days computers are used to   choices so being able to have hand-eye coordination will come in . So, not moving hand-eye coordination skills will not benefit you. Another way computer helps positive    they give people oppurtunity to about that for. You have the power to type in any place in the world of the computer will give you maps, images, videos and links.I personally have used the computer  or countries for school purposes and  gotten a good grade. If @CAPS5 is aren't for computer, does this people who'd be half   about. Lastly, I strongly suppport the usage @CAPS3  bestfriend @PERSON1 moved to iceland a little while ago and since I cannot text her anymore or call that easily, the computer gives me a chance to stay in touch with her by instant message, video, or email. The computer is a very important technologic device to many people. A young boy stated. ""I use video chat online to reach @CAPS2 father who is currently in @LOCATION1 for buisness, @CAPS5 is the ony way i talk to him."" This advantage in computers benefits so many people in all the same way, communication. To conclude, I strongly agree those who advance in thecnology. Computers are very imporant to our society, they help us teach hand-eye coordination, teach is about far away places, and give us ability to communicate with friends or family. I demand, you stand with me on @CAPS2 opinion about the positive effect  computers have on people"	2034	
2035	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology has been and will continue to grow very quickly. Computers are a very important aspect in peoples lives. Computers are very important for many reasons, computers create jobs for people, teach people various skills, and provide @CAPS3 intellegance. Computers technology is very much needed in our society. Even in todays economy, computers can give many people jobs based on their skills. According to a professor at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 work online or have received a job from a @CAPS1. If you are out of work and need to find a job you can type what job you are looking for and @PERCENT2 of the time you will a job you like. Computers are full of information on a almost everything there is to know. Computers are great teachers for various things, for example computers can help you train for your job or teach you how to cook a meal. According to @PERSON1, a father who works from home ""every afternoon I go on the @CAPS1 and find a new recipe to cook for dinner. The @CAPS1 is a life saver."" @CAPS3 inteligance is very important especially today. Without our modern day @CAPS1 technology, we would probably not be able to win any futer war. If a @ORGANIZATION3 agent go's into @LOCATION2 and finds important information they can e-mail the information back the their headquarters rather than writing a letter on paper were the letter might not make it or someone could intercept the letter. @CAPS1 technology is very important for these reasons: they provide people with jobs, they teach people various skills, and they provide the @CAPS3 with inteligance. So post a front page article on why modern day @CAPS1 technology is so important in our society. If you do so, more people will read you paper and you will gain respect from you piers and your newspaper will be the most popular newspaper in @LOCATION1."	2035	
2036	1	"Dear Newspaper, I support the groth of technology. The advances and useage of todays tech and gagets. It make sociaty run smoother and makes everyday lives better and easier. These are my three reasons why: it makes us smarter, we can easally communicate with friends and fammily, and just makes our lives easier. Things like computers make us smarter, reading news articals, lurning @CAPS1 things from videos make us smarter every day. There is a lot we can learn from the internet. Say you go on your homepage and see a news artical called ""@CAPS1 dinosor discovered in @LOCATION1, sounds interesting right? You click on it to read the full artical and you learn something @CAPS1. There is stuff like that all over the internet. Technology also helps us communicate with cellphones and instant messaging we can chat whenever we want. There is messaging over the internet with video chat and chat rooms. If I need to remind my friend i'll just shoot him a text. Communicating has become so much easier because of todays technology. Without a dout, computers make every day life easier. If I need to find a artical and write a report on it I'll use technology. I won't have to find an artical in the newspaper and write it down on paper. I could look up can artical on the internet and type my paper on microsoft word. I hope that my letter has convinced you that groth in technology is good because it makes us smarter, make communicating easy and makes our lives better."	2036	
2037	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have resently read from the town newspaper in @LOCATION1 that same people is arguing if we should have computer or not have computer. As I had descover this new interesting facts, I went around the town of @ORGANIZATION1, surveying teens and adults of what they had think about this. About @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS2 agreed that we should keep computers and that it's a good thing. I also believe that having computer is a great idea. My first reason is that computer is a good way to teach hand eye coordination. Most people are slow are typing. So using the computer helps typing skills and it would help people when plays the piano teach a certain keys. Computers could also teach hand-eye cordination start out by exercising your finger. This is one whay how computers are good to have. My second reason is that the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people. This is a good way why we should computers because then kids from school could go online to search up information about a person, places or thing for a certain project. So computer also help kids education through web. Also, many people then could able to find their long lost family's history online. This is my second reason why we should keep computer and new they're good for you. My third reason is that the computers allow people to talk online with other people. Some experts think having computer less time to interest with familys and friends. But in this case, computers helps you to comunication with alot of your friend and familys online especially long distance familys and friends. Also it helps people make new friends through chat or online pages. This is my third reason why we should keep computers and how they're good for you. In conclusion, I believe having computer is good for you and that it's a great idea. I believe this because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peoples, and even allow people to talk online with other people. I recommend you to allow people use the computers. This importants desicion is up to you."	2037	
2038	1	"Have you ever needed help with something and you used your computer to find the answer. Well that the computer has many benefits to offer. The computer teached you hand-eye coordination. Also people are able to learn about faraway places without actually going to the places, in addition people are now able to other people in faraway places. Now-a-days some people are not able to talk. However technology has found a solution. People would now be able to talk by just looking at the screen. If they look at the screen, the screen will read the persons eyes and transfer what they need to say, on to the screen. It really helps people in need. One day I had to do a report on another country. So I went to my computer to learn about the country. It's a lot easier than going to visit the country. Also the computer is a good way country if you want to go there. You could learn what they eat, drink, and even @CAPS1 knows what a web cam is. Well now computers are made with built-in web cams. Web cams allow you to talk to in faraway places. It really comes in handy. Computer are also a great way of meeting people. They can see how you live while, you can see how they live. So I am for the idea of the benefits of computers. They could teach you about other things. You could learn about a faraway place. As well as talking to people in faraway places. The computer really comes in very handy."	2038	
2039	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 on more and more people have been using computers. Good or bad? Well that’s why I'm here to give my opinion on the effects computers have on people. People that beileve this is a good idea agree on getting smarter, learn about faraway places and people, and also hand-eye coordination. But others disagree, and are concerned about being healthy, cyber bullying, and less time with friends, family's, and less time with nature. Their are many different ideas. Cyber bullying has been a problem @CAPS1 on. It has been going on for years. More and more kids have been caused in this incedent. There has been many incedent's over the internet. We a need a safe internet. By helping that is to spend less time on the internet. For an example less exercising. Many people are more worried about that which is a bad case. Being healthy and being in that right fit is good. We don't want more and more people using computers, and having to worry about weight, and being heathly. Experts dont wanna have to worry about that. On the other hand, computers are very technique. I beilive that the ability that computers can have on people, or the positive effect. Some good examples are talking to others online, learning about faraway places and people, and hand-eye coordiantion. But too much computer can have a negetive effect. I believe that people are spending too much time on computers, not good. Leads to many bad causes. For an example less time being down to earth, helping the world and less time with exploring nature. But most important being with family and friends. I hope you believe my opinion on the effect on computer. Because I do believe too much time with it can be bad for people. But I think spending a little time not to much is fine. But people want to be heathly, more active, and less cyber bullying. Thank you and hope you take my word for it."	2039	
2040	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 had been a great help to one seens it was invented. Their are ways that @CAPS1 effect every one, just like what the @CAPS1 experts people said computers are very greatful, fun and enjoyable but it just had for your healthy. I believe that people should stop spending so much time on @CAPS1 because its bad in many reasons like, too much taxes bills debts, exercise and family matters. @CAPS1 is bad for you as too much taxes because you waste so much on electricity and the more you get bills the higher the taxes goes. It depends on how rich or poor you are. If you don't have jobs and you are on @CAPS1 all day not finding jobs doing some none seens work it would effect your life. It would be on debts and that would be very hard to get them paid if you don't have jobs and money. It is important to have money and stop espending time on @CAPS1. Exercise is what people need during the time that you gain weight because seating all day eating food and no nutritions you would get obis which is too fat. No one would like that kind of situation in your young age. It is good to exercise sometimes if you have a break and get your muscle going than typing, searching and emaling with friends. I don't want to be mean for those people who just love seatng and doing no exercise. Family is one tough thing to do if you get in a fight for not caring them and not even thinking about them. Spending as much time as you can on family matters because you could talk, laugh and enjoy the day than your @CAPS1. Invite friends and your family to came together just for fun and you could learn a lot from them than yourself. Family is the one you would always have no matter what happend because you could protect each other on your worries and enjoy your life. @CAPS1 doesn't help much if you have worries because you imailed them but it would take a lot of time because they might not be checking their mail all the time. Family helps a lot on your problem, teamwork and spend time with your children. You could go to park with your family and enjoy the fresh air you would always remember in your life. The @CAPS1 would damage your school work if your a student because you would not get everything done and the next day you failed on your test or exam. Bad for students to not get a good and don't stay late children and specially with adults and to get a good night sleep everyday for at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day to work your brain on the next day. Save a lot of energy would help you than @CAPS1. @CAPS1 don't go to sleep because their technology than you do. Like some experts say that spending too much time on their computers would meant less time exercising, enjoying nature around you and interacting with family and friends. I would like everyone to get a good night sleep and just spend computers a little slowly that staying late. Spend less if you can for your own good health!"	2040	
2041	1	"Why would it be a bad thing to use computers? It's not, people need computers for many different things. So, no people do not spend to much time on the computer because, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online. Using computers teach hand-eye coordination. By playing games on the computer people learn how to react to something faster, than they would if they didn't have computers. Also, if people use computer at a young age they will know how to use it better and be able to get good jobs. Because if they know how to type then they will be able to type faster when they get older and type words a minute, that will led to good things later in there life. Another way the computer teaches hand-eye coordination is that when your taking test you wont skip a problem be misstake and get every problem form than on wrong. Computers teach use about faraway places. Think how hard it would be it if you had to o a school report on it and you did not have a computer. It would pretty hard. Or what if your planning a family vacation and you don't just went to go up to @LOCATION1 for the. What do you use to find a good place to travel to? The computer thats where! Or you know when you going, but not really wants there, the computer helps you in so many ways. Computers allow people to talk to one another online. This is good because for project at works at work people need to talk to one other because they need to know what they are doing wrong or right. School project, the kids need to know what they are doing and need to know where and when to meet. Or maybe someones baseball game got cancelled and one person doesn't know, so they other person tells him online instead of tieing up the phone lines. Maybe after a long day of school a kid just wants to talk to his friend and releaxe. So, using computers is not a bad thing because, they teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to talk to one another online. Having a computer is not a bad thing. Just do not over use it, and you will be fine."	2041	
2042	1	"Since the dawn of humanity, people have argued over the implementation of technology. Some argue that modern technology, i.e, computers, retract from our core values. I am not one of them. Computer, offer incredible converiance to their users, teach valuable real world skills, and link the world together in ways that were once thought impossible. Computers have already benefitted the world greatly, so why anyone would want to limit their implementation is beyond me. Since before the @DATE1, computers have put tons of information into the hands of anyone who wants it. Before this people would have to physically go the library and tedrously search for information. Now, all one has to do is click ""search"". Surely, this is the way that is of the most ease to people, so it is surprising to see negativity toward it. Its @DATE2. Space colonization is less than @NUM1 years away, cybernetic are getting stronger and cheaper, and most businesses are run by people using computers. In this modern era computers are replacing factories and such as the new need-to-know industry. But rather than going to special schools to learn these skills, one could-use their own home computer. By simply typing up e-mails,people are the skills needed to help in the computer industry. One also, learns problem solving skills when dealing with viruses and etiqutte when communicating with unknown people. It's a new millenium, and computers have taken the forefront. Perhaps most importantly, computers connect us, People in the @LOCATION6 can instantly chat with people in @LOCATION5, and scientists in @LOCATION2 can hastily communicate with scientists in @LOCATION4. Try doing that with pigeons. With computers, preaking news in @LOCATION1 is breaking news in @LOCATION3, and families on seperate equators seem to be only a thin piece of glass away. This is the modern world, and if some people don't like the thought of it, than! I will never understand. In conclusion, computers are the present, and the future. I live in a world where converance is for everyone jobs skills are taught through lif sure, and @NUM2 million people can play one game at once (myself included). This is the modern world, and computers are its creator."	2042	
2043	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think people should spend less time on the computer. @PERSON1 told me that he isn't on computer much because there are better things in life then sitting in a chair in front of the computer. When you are always staring at a screan it can make you cross eyed or even need glasses. You should always want to spend time with family, work on homeworth, or even play around outdoors. I know everyone does care about their family and friends more then the computer. I wasn't on the computer for @NUM1 days in arow because everything I care about is all around me including family and friends. You can alway find away to have fun with family and friends. Someways are by sleeding, swimming, snowball fights, vacations, or many other options that I haven't mentioned. I'm sure you can think of many more great ideas that I haven't. Spend more time with your family and friends and get off the computer. Another thing I know, is that most kids don't get their homework done because they are alway playing games on the computer. Before you let your teen near the computer make sure their homework is done and done right. If your child doesn't have good grades that shows they need to make more time working and focusing on school and a little less time on computers. Do you see your kids outdoors at all? If you don't get them outside more and more each day. They will have more fun then they ever thought they would outdoors. Tell them they can have a friend over if they get off the computer and go outside. They can have a snowball fight, race, swim, or whatever else the weather alows. My mom tells me, herself, and everyone in the family tell everyone you know this and have a friend over. In conclusion don't spend your life on the computer. Spend time doing homework, hanging out with your family and friends, and go out side. All of this requires no electricity, save money and get off the computer!"	2043	
2044	1	"Dear Newspaper, The effect of computers on people is negative. Much of the community is spending too much time on the computer instead of tending to their other needs. People are becoming unhealthy from less exercise and less time in nature. In addition computers are causing people to spend less time with their families and friends. Due to the advance in computers, many people spend too much time on the computer. From the results of a survey, @PERCENT1 of our community spends over @NUM1 hours each day on the computer. Think of the neglect that their homes and pets must be getting. People are becoming so engrossed in their computers that they are forgetting to clean their homes and feed their pets. How can computers be becoming a good thing when people's other obligations are being neglected? Not to mention that people are spending less time exercising and enjoying nature. A little over @PERCENT2 of our community has become obese since the advance in computer technology. When asked about changes in her life since the advance in computers @PERSON3 black had this to say. ""@CAPS1's true there has been a change in my life, I used to run @NUM2 miles each day, but since I have became addicted to my computer I barely run at all."" @CAPS2 of our town are unhealthy the are spending less time enjoying the beautiful nature in our town and more sitting infront of the computer screen. Don't you see a problem here? People have been spending less and less time interacting with their family and friends. @NUM3 in every @NUM4 @CAPS2 admit that since the advance in computers they have not spoken with their friends and family in @NUM5 straight weeks, where they used to speak with them every couple days. @PERSON1 says of sister @PERSON2 that @PERSON2 has not answered or responded to her calls at all since the advance in computers. Computers are pulling family and friends apart. With the advance in computers, when will these victims realize that they are alone with only their computer neglecting their real friends and family? In conclusion, the advance in computers is having a negative effect on @CAPS2. @CAPS2 are spending way too much time on the computer causing them to neglect their obligations. Our community is slowly yet strongly becoming physically and mentally unhealthy. Friends and family have been pulled apart due to the advance in computers. We must stop this advance in technology for the sake of our fellow @CAPS2."	2044	
2045	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a days more and more people use Computers Some people belive computers benefit our society but I understand not everyone does. Personaly, I belive compoters do benefit our society. One reason why I belive computers benefit our society is because they give people the ability to learn about other countries and people in other countries. On time I had to do a report on @PERSON1 and how she spent time with gorillias in other countries. Also, I think Computers benefit our society because they allow people to talk to each other online. One advantage of talking to each other online is if one of your close friends move can still keep-in-touch with them without running up your phone bill. Did you @CAPS3 @PERCENT1 of kids talk to each other online. Another reason why I agree that computers benefit our society are because it teaches hand-eye coordination. I belive hand-eye coordination is very important to hace for me I need to have hand-eye coordination because I play soft-ball and basketball. I understand why you might think computers don't benefit our society but I hope your thoughts have changed."	2045	
2046	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 you know people who work on computers all day are more obise than people who don't? I think people spend to much time on the computer. I say this because my mother works on the computer all day, then when she gets home she goes on @CAPS2. She is starting to gain weight. She doesn't spend enough time with her family and she doesn't go outsid unless it's to the car. First of all she is starting to gain weight because she is at work all she obese is sit at her desk all day, then when she gets home all she obese is go downstairs on the computer, and when she eats that is where you can find her. this isn't just my mother that doese this. Accountants do the same thing and so do lawers. this is why people need to spend more time off the computer and with their families. Secondly, people who work on computers all day don't spend enough time with their families. For example my friend has a dad who is an accountant. He is always teling me how he wishes he could spend more time with his family. I feel the same with my mom. If she spent more time with us than mabey she would be able to get out of the house are. Lastly, I don't think these people get enough time outside. Most people who have worked on computers all their life love became diabetics because they don't get enough exercise to keep their bodys healthy. For example my mother when she gets have she takes everything insid but bother to pat it away she goes strait to the computer. If she realize she left something in the car she runs to go get it and is always out of breath when she cames back. Then she goes to the computer to cool off. This is why people don't enjoy nature, get enough exercise, and get to see alot of their family. Theirfore why don't us do something about these who sit on their buts all day?"	2046	
2047	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do benefit societies because people think computers are important to them. Here are a few reasons why, @CAPS3 reason is computers have a positive effect on people. They love to check out cool websites on line. They can go on websites that they've already been to or try something new. Also, if people are trying to get work done online, the computer can help them get the job done. That way people don't have to struggle without @CAPS3. Another reason is people can talk with @CAPS3 another online. They could talk by @CAPS4 or by @CAPS5 chat. So, say for example, if someone wanted talk to a cousin they haven't seen in a while, they could via @CAPS5 chat online or maybe just talk to a friend just because they're bored. An easier way would be to @CAPS6 a friend and talk about how your life or his/her life is going. It's a great way to connect with other people. My last reason is kids and teens can do fun things online. For example, they can play games and activities on random websites. They could also make crafts on @CAPS7 @CAPS8 like make a card for a special occasion or something. They could also make music or videos to post for friends and family. But most importantly, they could just express themselves in many ways. So, now that you've heard my top @NUM1 reasons, do you think that computers benefit society? People think that computers are the best pieces of technology. You need to understand the importance of this, so please write back @CAPS9 with your decision. Thank you for your time."	2047	
2048	1	"I think that computers have a great effect on people. Computers help people by giveing directions, getting answers and getting gifts. My first reason is that a computer can give you directions. @PERCENT1 of people get lost because they do know the direction. The computer will give you direction to anywhere. For example you need to get from your house to the hospital and you don't know the directions? A computer can help you get the directions. Do you realy want to get lost. Next a computer will help you get answers. The makers of google say ""you can find all your answers here on google"". For example say you need the question to how to change brakes on a car? Go on google and you can find out how to. but on least, a computer will help you get gifts for people. Did you know @PERCENT2 of people can't find what gift theyre looking for. The other people say you can find anything in stores. Don't listen to them not all stores have are looking for. American.com states we have all you no what it is we have . So is this a god idea or what. To conclude a compter will help you got and get do help society in what you just read."	2048	
2049	1	"Dear @CAPS1: I belive that computers are a benefit to society. Computers are a very important part of life. They make life a whole lot easier then having to do something off knowledge. A computer is able to let you talk with friends or family that live in different areas all over the world. It also allows use to do research and make new discoveries. The computer is one of the most helpful utensils in this world. In short, computers make life easier without a doubt. They allows us to do homework assignments, reports, make the newspaper, etc. without a computer having to do this all by hand would be a some homework assignments require you to do research in a topic. It is go to the library to pick out a book but on the computer you would be able to gather more information in a faster of time. Reports might also report research to if a source of information could be gathered in a shorter amount of time why not use the computer. Then theirs your newspaper. The computer allow you to make the newspaper faster than you would help when you only had type written. The evolution in technology helps make our life less @CAPS2, talking to friends and family all over the world is something a computer was made to do we like facebook, myspace, aim, etc. If your family lives in a country such as @LOCATION1 and you wont be able to if you live in a different part of the world you would still talk to friends and a good friend or another miles away from when you live, probably wouldn't them there. You would go the internet to talk to him/her and keep in touch. This doesn't mean that you would be to spend time with friends and family. Schedule your time so could fit talking to distant family and hanging out with friends or family after school. Lastly, the computer lets use new discoveries about places or find something and a location that we have never been to. If you wanter to ho on vacation to a tropical area you might which areas are tropical and the places that are freezing cold all year long. If you wanted to explore places with the computer could find that information in a matter or But some people and forget that they like exercise. To sum it all us, computers are a good thing to have because of more benefits in society. They make life easier. In no task, we are allowed to interact with family or friends that live in different areas make new or find out information about places you never knew about."	2049

Why try to save all the comptureys in the State that why i don't like the cant's of that because make me every mad of the agree with the people that why you are mad sackers the why no one likes you the agrees with the people what i don't you are make me bad today happen yasterday.

2051	1	"Computers have been around for not very long. Still, a few generations, including my own, have been raised on this technology. We @MONTH1 not be as social and outside as our parents and grandparents, but that doesn't mean anything. We can't go out as much as they could becaue of the many dangers outside our doors. Computers are also here to help with homework, look up local news, or just search for something to do like seeing a movie. Another factor is that they @MONTH1 not be perfect, but computers teach us an important lesson that we should all attempt to follow. When past generations were kids, they had so much freedom and time to have fun. They would return home from school, complete their homework and chores, and then they were out to see their friends. They were able to do this because all of the people in town knew each other so if theynoticed something suspicious, they reported it. Today most neighbors don't know each other so kids can't be looked after while out playing ball. The world is a cruel place with killers, rapists, addicts, and much more. To caps with this teens and children look for an alternative. It just so happens that we have computers which we can do anything on. For instance, i could play a game watch a video on youtube, listen to music, talk to friends, and search the""@CAPS1"". Yet adults want to take that away despite it being the only other thing we got. You msut look at what computers do for us that's good not just what's bad. Say i just hopped off the bus and am loaded with week to do. I pull out my math and it looks like another language to me. I then could just bring go the internet and look up how to do it. There's almost every possible""how to"" guide or the @CAPS1 so if you're having trouble starting up the lawn mower, then lok it up. Even if you're just bored or curious, any information can be obtained via the computer. Without @CAPS2.C.s or @PERSON1, our entire civilization would be last. Still, if ou ask most people, they'll tell you that the internet and computers are dark and evil places. That they're full of sick people and videos, but that's not necessarily true. Yes, there are many bad things on the internet, but there is in life too, right? In fact, i believe it is a great that there are very bad things online but you have to listen. Say you catch your child doing something bad like getting into fights. You'd sit him/her down and talk to them or punish them right? They'd learn from their mistake and probably wouldn't do anything like that again so why wouldn't that apply to computers too? Computers can teach us, through mistakes, how to be better people. In the end, i believe there @MONTH1 be a lot wrong with computers, but that they have a much better side too. Our world has changed, they're have to help, and they teach us an important life lesson. So why shouldn't they stay?"	2051	
2052	1	"Dear Newspaper, I disagree with those experts, who say that people are spending to much time on their computers. I am pretty sure that people aren't on their computer most of their day. I think computer made society a lot easier. I'll tell you why. One reason I think computers have good affects on people is because they help children on school work. The computer helps children in a lot of ways. For example if a child needed to know the defenition of a word and they didn't have a dictionary, they can just look it up on the internet. The computer makes it easier for kids to find things. Instead of looking through a whole bunch of books, they can just go on the computer and get the information there. Therefore, the computers have good affects on people. Another reason I think computers have good affects on people is because it helps people of their job. At a lot of jobs computers are necessary. For example, teachers need computer for grades and assignments, people who work at the bank need computer to know who took out money and etc... Many jobs include working on a computer. Computers make work easier at jobs. Therefore, computers have good affects on people. Another reason I think computers have good affects on people because you learn more. You learn how to do many things. For example, if you typing an essay the computer checks the grammar. The computer see mistakes that you might have missed and points it out to you. You can find information in a computer easier than taking a while looking, for the information in a book. It makes work a whole lot easier. Therefore, I think computers have good affects on people. Now I hope the people who read this letter see where I am coming from. So, therefore, in my opinion, computers have good affects on people. "	2052	
2053	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have positive effects on people everyday. They allow people to research far away places and people. People can also use them to talk to people online and learn hand-eye coordination at the same time. One benefit that people gain from using computers is learning and researching about far away places and people. For example, if someone wanted to learn more about @LOCATION1, they can log into their computer and search @LOCATION1. By learning about @LOCATION1 people can be more aware of the people that live there too. @CAPS1 is a chance to learn the differences and similarities between their lifestyle without having to go on a trip. Since the computer provides all of this information people are @PERCENT1 more aware of all the global issues and not only the ones where the person lives. Also learning about a different place or culture might interest or encourage the person to actually visit the place and learn even more about @CAPS1 even with the research. In addition to providing information about different places, computer also teach people hand-eye coordination. Using a keyboard without looking helps people develop skills such as hand-eye coordination, @CAPS1 is important to have excellent typing skills because @CAPS1 can help students with their schoolwork and adults with their careers. Teachers @MONTH1 assign essays or prompts that must be typed and @CAPS1 would be beneficial for students to have the ability to type their essay efficiently. If a person has hand-eye coordination then @CAPS1 can also improve the way they play a sport. Some jobs require adults to have typing skills such as a secretary. Someone could not get the job they want because they don't have enough knowledge of computers to be able to do @CAPS1. Another reason that computers have a positive effect on people is that @CAPS1 even allows people to talk online with other people. This is positive because sometimes someone's best friend moves far away and can't call them because its long distance. They can use the computer to stay in touch with the person by talking to them with email, facebook, or @CAPS2. Also they can plan to meet each other once a year by losing the computer to communicate to one another. Even if the person doesn't live far away people can still talk to their friends online. They can socialize and plan events that can happen on the weekends or after school the next day. Some experts say that computers are not allowing people to interact with family and friends. that is not true because they can talk online and plan to meet each other and interact with them. In conclusion, computers positively effect people. The computer teaches people hand-eye coordination, and far away play and people. @CAPS1 is also a way people can talk to each other and stay in touch. People should be encouraged to use their computers."	2053	
2054	1	"Thirty or so year ago, technology was not exactly advanced. People did not have the technological our society has today, yet they live just fire. Today, in the year @DATE1, it is nearly impossible to image life without texting, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1. All of these things are part of our modern society. Machines have really""taken over"" just like on those cheezy old-families. Without a doubt, society is @PERCENT1, dependent on their @CAPS5, and other technology. Is that healthy? Do you believe computers help or hurt our lives as @CAPS6, and humans? Many of us enjoy the wonders of @CAPS7's fine creation; unlimited texting! We text every we go, our cellphones are almost a part of us. Dont get me wrong, I love our generation's advancements on technology. In fact, I think computers make out lives much easier. If you want to do research on @PERSON1 for your @CAPS8 month project. The internet's got you covered. The old fashioned folks still prefer the library, but not us. If you want to talk to a friend, really quickly, just text them, their just a click away. A few uninlighted people, might think all of this technology just how lazy. What these few people who the virtual computers lives more convinient, @NUM1 out of @NUM1 teens say. In addition my fellow reader of the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, computers teach us tons of things! Typing is a must have skill in today to work. Obviously Computers also have a variety at endless topics available to. The internet is like a gigantic library that offers you anything, and everything with just a click of a button. So explore away, you'll be amazed at the things youll in the of the iternet. too much of is bad for you. This also goes for the remarkably fascinating cyber world. It is important to about life outside your. there is many great things outside of a computer, @CAPS12 seems essential to and they use, however, it is to about family, friends and that good stuff. Use computers's moderately, your wife and kids will appreciate it. Before you try using that line of advice on kids, save your breath. It will not work. What have we learned today my fellow readers? the world of computers offer us many great things, and we should take advantage. If that, we would be fools not too. Those of us who are smart enought to understand the importance of computers in our daily lives, have accepted the challenge and are now part of our generation's finest achievement. When I look at my @NUM3 something year old @CAPS13 ma playing on the computer. I know it is not an impossible task and all can be to this @CAPS9 technology. Even our @CAPS14 @PERSON2 knows the importantce to reaching younber audiences by logging onto @CAPS3. @PERSON2 says,""The internet is apart of our lives, and it's a positive thing. It's a great thing."" On that note, I age you all to join the computer side. on the internetn and tweet away."	2054	
2055	1	"Who would rather stare at a bright nausiating screen than share time with your friends? Why would you sit inside, lying around when you could be running around outside in the fresh air? Why not get up and get active? You should want to hangout with friends run around, and enjoy the outdoors. Here's the controversy: does technological advances hurt people more than they help? Technology makes children and adults less active. @PERSON1, a specialist from the @ORGANIZATION1 organization @CAPS1 that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2 spend more time watching @CAPS3 and on the computer that outside, getting exercise. This is a huge problem because that can lead to obesity. Obesity can cause high blood pressure and diabetes. Some people @MONTH1 say technology gives you better hand-eye coordination. This @MONTH1 be true however, wouldn't you rather be getting the same or even better hand-eye coordination by playing sports, which also benefit your health. Replace video games with baseball and get more things in return. Enjoying nature is fun and captivating. The beautiful, colorful flowers fill your nose with delighting scents. There are blushing roses and cheery sunflowers. Along with plants there are lots of different animals scampering around outside. Birds are perched up on a tree, chirping back and form as if conversing about their day. Not only is nature wonderful to look at, it gets you out of the house and away from time-wasting things like computer games. Before turning on that television, remember what living things were already given to this world, waiting for you to take in their beauty. Time with friends and family is something you want to hold on to and cherish. Why waste it ""surfing the net"" on gazing blankly at a box. People who care about their loved ones would rather spend their time with them instead if inanimate object. Family and friends are what are important in life. You should care most about them. Try to peel yourself of the @CAPS3 screen and talk to the ones who care most. Now is the time to see whether you support technology advances or think you could be doing better things. You could be running around, having fun while staying healthy. Bright flowers and giddy animals are right outside your door. Most importantly the people around you should get more time from you than your electronics so get off that couch, get outside and spend time with people you care about the most!"	2055	
2056	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers have become increasingly popular and advanced. So much so that I feel they are intefering with our lives andv having negative effects on the @CAPS4 people @CAPS5 example, many people spend hours on computer when they could be excercising and staying healthy. Another negative effect is how much computers cost, and the financial problems computers brings. Lastly, computers are a huge factor of how families have been spending less & less time together. One way computers effect us is exercise. Many people practically live on their computers and never leave the house. This is a problem, especially with the obesity issue how it is already in @LOCATION1. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS12 spend more time on their computers than exercising. It is not healthy to sit at a computer, ""frying your brain"", (as my mom would say) and not exercising at all. Why not go take a jog, or go to the gym with your friends, @CAPS6, I've chosen backyard football with neighborhood friends over computers many times, and I've been happy with that choice. I beleive that computers are effecting how much exercise we got and not in a positive way. If everyone ditched computers @CAPS5 a little while and exercised a little more, we'd be closer to erasing our countries tttle of the.""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 in the @CAPS9."" @CAPS10 the negative effect computers have on excercise is a major issue, it is not the only one. Another huge issue is their effect on money and financial problems. New technology is cool, but it comes with a price (literally), Technology, especially computers, is getting more experience almost by the day. Computers are ridiculously expensive, and it is starting to have an effect on the people wallets. Many people feel the need to have the bigger and better things, such as new computers. Some people buy a new computers model when it comes out just to say they have it. Who has hundreds of @MONEY1 to spend in the blink of an eye to buy a new computers which also supply you with even more bills. You need to pay @CAPS5 repair bills, @CAPS11 my computer broke and my dad had to spend close to @MONEY1 trying to fix it. And many people have computer in their house. This could let to financial problems and here are better things to spend money as such as healthy fresh foods that our body deserves. Computers have also started to limit the amount of family time that @CAPS12 are getting. Several families almost never speak to one another because they are to buried in their computers. One good example of this was on the @ORGANIZATION1 show. @ORGANIZATION1 had a family on @CAPS13 that was totally anti-social with one another. The mother would make dinner, and the other family members would just grab it and take it whenever to eat. The dad went to his office to do work on his laptop, the son went to his room to use the computers, and the daughter did the same. The mother was left alone, either to use a computer or to sit & eat by herself. This is a great example of how computer can and are effecting the amount of family time @CAPS4 families are having. With computers taking over their lives many families now spend little or no time with their family. There are so many other things to do, like to take a family bike ride, take a road trip, make a family craft, or even play a board game or learn to cook. The only way to get better families is to closer, and computers are restricting the amount of family time families are recieving. Now I hope you see the negative effects computers are having on @LOCATION1. lack of exercise, wasted money and minimal family time are only a few problems. If we didn't have computers, these problems would go away. @CAPS10 computers do have some benefits, it would be better in the long run @CAPS5 them to disapear. That is my opinion."	2056	
2057	1	"Dear local Newspaper, People seem to be using computers a lot more, well this is a great thing, computers are used to @CAPS3 anything, @CAPS1, surf the web, chats, buissness, typing letters, movies, news, research, hand-eye coordination. Those are only a few things computers are good for. I believe that computers @CAPS3 benefit society. The first good thing about computers is it teaches hand-eye coordination, Hand-eye coordination can come into good use such as, keyboarding, typing school paper, searching websites, searching research on google and typing buissness papers. All these things become something in sentence everyday life and hand-eye coordination helps and does a big part in typing. The next thing which helps everyone is using a computer for learning. And I mean learning about anything. You name it and a computer has information about it.Whether it be pictures or websites with pages of typed words. A few examples are, differenr cultures, foods, technology, schools,science,math,history,english,celebrities,music,supplies,stores,clothing,accesories, places, everything is on a computer. A computer can teach you different and A system that The last thing @CAPS1 @CAPS3 you I know I way of teensv and @CAPS4 with a computer have a facebook account. Facebook is made so you can chat with your friends and family who @MONTH1 live faraway. You can also post pictures and send videos to each other. Facebook is mostly for @CAPS4 and teens who wants to chat and reconnect with family and friends. But speaking of chatting with each other, another way chatting on a computer is used is webcams. Webcams are little cameras either installed into your laptop or its attached to your computer. You turn it on and you and your friend can talk and see each other over the computer! It's great, and family who live far away @CAPS3 it too! In conclusion, I beleive computers are not causing any problems and they are use then correctly and they benefit our society."	2057	
2058	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you have a @CAPS5? I also believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help in many ways. You can play games when you are stressed, they can be used for research, and allow you to talk to friends and family online. After a long day of work or school people can be pretty tired. Why not sit down in front of the @CAPS5 and play some games? Dr. @DR1 @PERSON1 says ""Computers are great way to take off the pressure of a stressful day of work. I would reccomend to anybody who is stressed to sit down and play some @CAPS5 games."" @CAPS5 games can also teach you about hand eye coordination. If you @CAPS4 a sport having hand eye coordination is important. For example; in compell cheerleading, through my expereinces, you are lifting people into the air and if they fall you need to be able to chach them. If you you don't have good hand eye coordination you wont be able to check the person you are lifting. Nobody knows everything. Computers are a good source for research. They can help you with finding the right vaction spot, if you need to @CAPS4 a project for school or work, and even if you just want to learn more. If everybody had computers @PERCENT1 of students grades will increase because the @CAPS5 will help them. And the information they need for their projects. @CAPS4 you like to go on vacation with your family? The @CAPS5 can help you find cheap vactions in minutes. All you have to @CAPS4 is a little research and in no time you will be flying off to a week of fun with your family. A lot of people don't have cellphone how are they support to keep in with friends and family? If they have @CAPS5 all they have to @CAPS4 is go online. @CAPS5 allow you to video chat, voice chat, and just type. With video chat it is just like having in the with you. Video chat lets you talk to another perosn and see them whos your talking to them. If you have family in another you can to them using video chat, voice chat is just like a phone call but it is over the @CAPS5. With voice chat you don't have to put a phone up to your ear you can hear people through speakers on your @CAPS5. For people who would rather just read you can type messages to other people. This way you can start a nice conversation while your doing other things like cooking. There for, a @CAPS5 can help you with many different thing like becoming unstressed, research and talking with people online. I believe the question now is when are you getting a @CAPS5? Thank you."	2058

Lets face it, the majority of people throughout the world have at least one computer in their house hold. But the amont of time that people go on the computer for is really the real world and cyber bullying are key factors as to why computers @CAPS9't benefit society. Let's take a deeper look into those issues. Running, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and waking are all forms of exercise right? I @CAPS9't think anywhere in @CAPS8's something about cliking a button or mouse. Truth is, as @CAPS5 grows, so does the amount of people who are overweight. But, @CAPS11 you stay on the computer for more than hour, and ddon't exercise, that is not gona to make the rise for overweight people in @LOCATION1. Some say clicking a button could be beneficial but I just @CAPS9't agree. I'm more than @PERCENT1 sure that @CAPS11 every single @CAPS5 was allowed to go on the computer for just anneccessary and up their exercise, that maybe the overweight number will decrease of course, that goes into eating healthy. Exercise benefits the society, not computers. ' @CAPS7, are you coming house?"" "" Not, I'm to my friends on !"" @CAPS8 is nothing to her mother. Computers seperate teens from the real world. Most teenageers most likely talk to their friends on the computer then for a test. That goes for adults to the computer and world chat then go to , @CAPS9't you think on the computer that I'm sure not happen in the real world. Computers the bring it together. @CAPS13. The one word most @CAPS10 deny doing. Yet, a lot of @CAPS10 @CAPS9't even notice their doing it. it comes to all different forms. It court be as little as calling someone a name or as threatening to kill someone. I'm taking a shot here but, a lot of these @CAPS10 who do it, know for a fact, that they wouldn't say it to the persons face. @CAPS8 are @CAPS10 who are scared to come to school because of @CAPS13. How does that benefit the society? @CAPS10 being scared is defiently not good it's the total opposite. @CAPS13 is hot the way to go. In the end, it's really up to the person themselves @CAPS11 they want risk their health by not exercising, or seperating themselves from their family, or maybe even bullying someone on the computer Exercising, @CAPS12 and @CAPS13 are all reasons for why computers @CAPS9't benefit the society. Stop the growth of Computers."	2059

2061	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 there have been many arguments about computers and their effects. I, personally, have mixed feelings. Computers can have a lot of pros and cons! For one, many people don’t get enough @CAPS7 when they own a computer, especially teengers. But also, we can gain alot of knowledge from computers. Finally computers can take you away from or even connect you to, your family. Computers could really benfit us, or do the exact opposite. In todays world of technology, hours can pass without being noticed. This could become a very bad thing, because then @CAPS7 would be pushed aside @PERCENT1 of teenagers aged @NUM1 stated that they spend at least three hours after school on the computer. That's three hours of son wasted when, instead of chatting to friends online, they could have gone outside and exercised. Also, dont forget the parents! With sites like @CAPS5, when lets them talk to friends and play games they could be sucked in too.""@CAPS6 wait does any of this have to do with @CAPS7?"" you might ask. Truthfully, everything. During the day, when just walking around outside be @CAPS7, people the computer. Do you think anyone wants to @CAPS7 in the dark? I sure don't @CAPS7 is greatly imported by computers. With the use of computer, we can learn so much. work, we constantly need to learn different countries. Their conditions, culture, economy, you it. What computers, we would be able to receive this easily, if at all. Second, we can even learn about our owe country. Computers help with our leaving eryday. The @CAPS8 of computer and is very mixed. For example computers can contact you and your family you have hour family tourch with each others. Also, computers can take you away from the family. If everyday your on the computer, soon if not carefol, you could start spending all your time on it, even eating at it. Finally, sending pictures and video through email is very common. From a childs frist steps to a graduation, if somebody unfortunatly coudn't be there, it could seem like they were. Through"	2061	
2062	1	"Dear Local Newspaper. I hear that many experts believe that people spend way to much time on the computer, well thats why im writing this. I disagree on your opinion because from what I hear the computer helps the human body with alot of things. Like it teach then hand-eye cordination. It also gives them the chance to communicate, lets them learn about where they are from and about other people and places. The reason why I disagree on the experts opinion is cause without the computer how else would people learn about where they live and other places, besides books. Like say book wasn't invented how else would we know about where we live and stuff. Computers all you have to do is find a computer and you would know. Like if you don't know how to reach the computer will teach you just go to the website and say wat you want to read and it pops-up. Another reason I disagree is because the computer helps you on your hand-eye cordinates too. Cause when you are typing or messaging some one you are using you hand cordination. And when you are reading something you are using you eye cordination, like there are many more way the computer help people. The computer also does other things. It lets you communicate with people you know or @MONTH1 not know. Like surpose that you have a family member that lives faraway and no only can talk of the computer you both can communicate if you can talk over the computer to. Now do you see why I disagree it so you would change your opinion. But if not you just don't get that the computer is alway needed."	2062	
2063	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am taking the time to write this letter, because I feel that computers are beneficial to everyday life. Not only do they improve hand-eye coordination, but there are many websites to find long-lost friends or that special someone. Computers also can be combined with software to create the ultimate learning experience. It's rather simple to see why computers are beneficiary. Right off the bat, hand eye coordination is improved. No pen intended, but I play baseball and I feel that my computer time has helped up my batting average to five hundred. Experts that spending all day on a computer will soften your brain and make you a slouch. This is true, but not if the computer is used in moderation, like everything in life. Those same ""expert"" providing us with false accounts are probably the ones who sit slouched at a computer all day. Who are t hey to lie to us? I strongly believe that many physical activities are positively by sports. Without further ado, it is so easy (a caveman could do it) to keep in touch with old friends and relatives, or possibly even find the love of your life. Modern day websites, such as @CAPS1, allow everyone with internet access, to reliably go online and chat with their friends. Sure, it @MONTH1 not be the same as talking wiht that friend in person, but what if they live halfway across the world? It's the next best thing in life. I, personally, don't have an account in this website, but approximately ninety percent of my friends do, and it largely impacts their everyday lives. Many modern day softwares, such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3, (a language program) help our nation, and even the world. Soldiers in the great @LOCATION1 need to know basic things in many languages, because they wouldn't be able to interact with @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 interpreter. Without translation efforts, and many other effects, we could be losing the war, horridly, we wouldn't be such a great nation if we were free, because freedom is our biggest right as an independent country. Coming to a conclusion, computers ar beneficiary to everyday life. They improve abilities, such as hand-eye coordination, and provide sample resources to find long-lost friends. Computers also have software compatibility, so that our nation can be free. Well, there's not much left to say, so go publish this and let the people hear the truth!"	2063	
2064	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am a supporter in technology and I belive comptures are an important part in use them for work, recreation, and to learn new and current things around the world. Computer with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about current events and far away places, also the opportunity in communicate with others several away in many different ways. I belive computers are a very useful tool that should be used to extent. Computers in schools all access @CAPS2 mue and continue to help children lean educate them with materials that possibly could not be taught in the classroom. They teach kids with special needs hand-eye coordination and moter skills. Without computers kids would be mostly taught which isn't bad but its not the same as having valuable a information a click away. Have you ever been to forigen country? Or are you doing a project in school on one and you need some quick facts. You turn to an encyclopida that was published in @DATE1. Maybe the leader has your country war @LOCATION1. Whats the population today? You wouldn't know. The book all you would have to do would be to go online and type in ""@LOCATION1."" @CAPS3! Easy as that. You have the population, feeds curent leader everything to know. With modern day you can learn about far away place out trip there. Do you have family that doesn't live near you but you wish you could jump on that computer and pop up @CAPS4! On that website, and others like it, you can chat with friends and family that are far away from you. Even if you just perfer to chat with someone online in a chat room, the computer many ways of having you communicate with others. Talk to them? Computers are a very resourcefull tool and when used properly it can benifit you in your school work, social life, keep you updated in current events, help you about, and even entertain you and you friends with a fun game or a watch. I am a strong beliver in modern day technology and computers alot to offer so I say use them to their full extent."	2064

2066	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people believe that computers are one of the best pieces of technology in this world today. However, computers can actually be much more of a nuisance than people realize. Computers do serve their purpose and they are very useful, but computers take the place of too @CAPS3 important things. Computers have such a negative effect on people, which is destroying our society. Computers have this bad effect on people because this technology takes time away from people exercising, people rely to much on computers, and it takes time away from interacting with family and friends. Have you ever wondered why @LOCATION1 is sometimes referred to as fat? Well, this is because citizens of this country don't spend enough time exercising, and spend too much time on the computer. The average persons is on the computer for at least an hour a day. According to health statiticians, a person should get at least an hour of exercise a day. The time that is spent on the computer could be used for exercise. Now @CAPS4 you're really ""glued"" to the computer, you can still use it while exercising. For example, while my dad is using the treadmill, he watches television series on the computer. So. being on the computer for a long time is not an excuse for not exercising. Unfortunately, way too @CAPS3 people don't believe this, which is part of the reason why computers have such a negative effect on people. @CAPS3 parents of children who go to school agree that students rely too much on computers. This is very true. When students get home, they go on the internet to find the answer to their home work. Instead of ""surfing"" the web, these children could easily walk to the library and get an encyclopedia or dictionary to find the answers. @NUM1 times out of @NUM2, you can find answers better in a book than online. In addition, kids always rely on things like e-mail to stayin touch with each other. Whatever happened to calling someone, or mailing a letter to them? It can be guareenteed that @CAPS4 the internet across the world was shutdown for even just a day, kids would go insane. This has a negative effect on the human mind because people don't know how to work hard anymore because everything is on a computer. now, why should our society be destroyed by just a little piece of technology? How @CAPS3 people get to interact with friends and family on a daily basis? The answer is: not too @CAPS3 @CAPS4 people would take some time a way from computer, they could interact with family and friends. Instead of contacting there people through a computer, it would be much better to actually see them in person. Furthermore, instead of playing game on the computer, you could invite some friends over your house to have a friendly game of cards. The kids have fun, and get to interact with each other @CAPS5, instead of e-mailing your family, family, you could have dinner with them somewhere. It gives everyone a chance to catch up on things. Plus, @CAPS3 people seem to have a better time when they can verbally interact with each other, rather than through a computer. @CAPS4 computers didn't take the place of family and friends interacting, maybe this technology wouldn't have a bad effect. In conclusion, it is clear that computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, computers take time away from people exercising. Secondly, people rely too heavily on computers. Last, computers take time a way from people interacting with family and friends. Think about it. Computers are having bad effects on people, and we don't even realize it. @CAPS4 we are supposedly such a strong country, how can we let the simple computer slowly destroy our society?"	2066	
2067	1	"Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 computers is a good thing but in most cases I disagree with @CAPS2 people use them. I know most people who have computers or don't, are debating about problems, the amount of time people spend on the computer and how these machines effect the environment. Lets take a glimpse at those ideas. Did you know that the amount people spend on the computer is @NUM1 hours average a day! In my opinion that means @CAPS3 and the rest of the people in the world use their time in the computer way too much. @PERSON3 a computer opperator told @ORGANIZATION1 that he is fixing more and more computers each year. To me this means laptops and such can't handle the way people are using them. This is a big bennefactoring problem to the usage of computers. More await for you to know. People next to the computer for hours but what they really don't know, is that could cause obesity, and maybe even eye problems ""In the time we are on the computers we been exersizing"" says @PERSON2 at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 school. @PERCENT1 of obisity in the world is from the computer and people not doing something else like enjoying nature. In addition to obisity, computers are changing the world dramaticly, by making people different. If people are different they treat the environmen differently, either for better of for worse. I think for worse. @PERSON1, Nature preserver noticed and reported less and less people out of the house to enjoy nature each @DATE1. Even very @CAPS5 populated states has reported less people outside in the environment. They say @PERCENT2 of their population is in their homes either on the computer or some other technology device. It's not good to use computers when we can enjoy our planet while we have it. If we keep using computers the environment will get ruined even more, we will have @CAPS5 populations of overweight citizens, and the time spent on the computer will be almost all the time, we need to do something fast about computers as well as other devices like cell phones. Therefore, I say maybe higher prices so @CAPS5 on computers, and make people pay even more for internet. We can figure something out to help with this situation."	2067	
2068	1	"A computer is considered a genius to people. It can provide information and chat with other people. Although these things great, you forget about yourself. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, but not on yourself. Books have been a great resource to everyone around the world. They provide information. Computers provide information, but they don't let you exercise, spend time with family, and enjoying nature. Anyone that has a computer knows you can do almost anything on it. Some people don't understand there are people that steel information from you with viruses. Those people can take your credit card number and many more important information from you. Did you know @LOCATION1 is the fattest country? Many people say it's from fast food. That is true, but it is also from sitting in a chair all day with your eyes glued to a screen. Why would you do that when your friends and family are, waiting to have fun with you? The computer has many websites that allow you to play games. Why would you do that when you can play games with family and friends? As you are doing that you are also enjoying nature and exercising at the same time. Only caring and friendly people would want to do this, but unpleasant and grampy people sit in a chair all day ingnoring everything but a computer. Ninety percent of @CAPS1 get married to a male or female. If you are the person that loves your computer, marry it. People who get married to a person are considered normal. Computer lovers are considered weird. Do you want to be a normal person that has a great time away from computers or not? Statistics say that a computer is the master of providing information. Why would you get information from a box when you can get it from a library? Why do you think libraries were built, to look pretty? All the intellegent people read books to find information. If someone has kids they need to learn to read. Eighty-five percent of all children that start reading at a young age are most likely to be very successful as an adult. At a library you can get information and meet new people at the same time. You cant do that with a computer. ""@CAPS2 am I loosing money; I didnt buy anything?"" That is what a person would say when someone found a way to get in your computer and take your credit card number. Yes, a computer can do many things, but they can also do some bad things. Smart and responsible people would know what a virus is once it is in your computer. There are some people that are very intellegent and bad. Those people send viruses to people on computers to steel data from you. If someone spends a long time on a computer then the virus will have enough time to get to your computer. If you just close down the computer nothing will happen. Computers have viruses, but the only virus someone can get is when it is winter and get the flu. Would you rather get sick for a short time or loose your information forever? Sixty-nine percent of people that spend their whole day on the computer get a virus in there computer and get stolen. It is alright to spend a short time on the computer."	2068	
2069	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 im going to start off saying I agree with you but then I disagree. I agree because yea computers are very helpful to kids it helps us do our homework, school projects, and helps us with more stuff but I also disagree because people do get excersise moving your fingers are helping you exersise so is breathing and it also helps with peoples typing the more you type @CAPS2 sit on the computer you learn how to type but you also learn informational site. I also agree because you might family you havent seen in forever and you can go online and talk to them. When you know you can make a routine like you say okday I getfrom school do my homework, go take snower go on the computer for about a hour and a half then go out side and play around or go explore or go for a walk or something. I understand people do stay on the computer fo a long time, but some people rather sit there and gain wait but that's them. They do what the please. And even when people are on the computer they can be looking up new ways to lose wait. You never know what they are doing. They teach you hand-eye coordination. Yeah I understand that and I can relate to it to I used to always look at the keyboard its just like a video game controller you have to memorize all of the buttons and where they are if you think about it like that then you'll end up typing faster and faster. @CAPS2 I get to get going."	2069	
2070	1	"Computers definitly benefit society. Computers are becoming the number one source of news and entertainment. Some experts believe computers are not good because it keeps them from doing things such as talking with friends and family, and keeps people from excersizing. They are wrong because computers have programs that let you talk to your family and friends, such as @CAPS1. It allows you to send text messages with each other. Also, new computers have equipment inside of it and you can video conferance with someone. You can talk to the computer and the person you want to talk to can see and hear you. The internet has all kinds of nature photos on it. You can search want you want to see, and before your eyes, it is there. Although it would be better to see the outside world up close, with a touch of a button, you can see things that are halfway across the globe. Take @LOCATION1, for example. It is a long flight to get there, and is probally expensive. If someone who likes excersize has a computer, they can buy equipment. Finaly, computers help your hand eye coordination. If you are on the web looking for information, and you find a link to what you are looking for you won't have to worry about moving the mouse in the wrong direction. To sum up, computer are an essential piece of technology. They let you communicate with your friends and family, allow you to see nature, and raises your hand-eye coordination"	2070	
2071	1	"Imagine living in a world without any computers; @CAPS1 things would be so much tougher, people would be wasting paper, and we wouldn't be able to communicate like we do now. The computer is a very helpful resource, a conserver, and a good way of communication amoung friends, family, business, and more. First of all, computers are very helpful to every single person in this world because it's full of knowledge. I can tell you everything about anything. A lot of people would disagree with having computers because the claim that it makes you dumb, but when you really think about it, it gives you so many more answers than a textbook would. Next, computers save trees by having people send emails instead of writing letters or taking tests online instead of giving everyone a paper. People also say that people need to get out and enjoy nature, well you can't really enjoy nature when there aren't any trees left. Also, just to make the paper causes for polution in the air because paper is made at factories, so with a computer you would be saving more than just trees, you would be going green and saving the earth. Last but not least, computers help people communicate all around the world at any time. It even allows you to see someone even if they are miles away or even in a different continent. Theres oovoo, facebook, myspace, etc., they all give you a way of communicateing without having to drive to that persons house. In conclusion, computers help people and the earth in a lot of ways, like helping researchers, saving nature, and helping people communicate to their loved ones. So when people say they disagree with computers, I remind them that its only here to help and make life easier for everyone."	2071	
2072	1	"What do I think about people spending too much time on the computers and not exercising often? Well, i'll tell you what think about it. I'm not saying it's bad you just need take a break from it. Excersise is good for you your active & playfut it's real fun. To begin, you should plan how long to stay on a computer. So for example @NUM1 - @NUM2 hrs. plan a schedule what websites you want to go on. Say you want check your email for @NUM3 or @NUM4 minute if you have a lot. The play computer games for @NUM5 mins. After your going to type a report that might take you an hour, your finished now! Next, you can play and excersise. The sports play are baseball, basketball, football, soccer, dodgeball, and many more. Or the games you can if you don't like sports frisbee, catch, footrace, hide and seek and more. These activties can give a break from the computer. Finally, there is one more way you can spend time off the computer you can go out with you family to the movies, waterpark, restaurant, road trip, and more. It gets your off of unimportant stuff. It's relax"	2072	
2073	1	"Local newspaper, I am concernd about the amount of kids that use the internet. With your help will decress this number. Imagin you are a @NUM1 year old kid that has problems in school, with many people. The intrenet is just another way. Those kids can bully you. This bullying is called cyber bullying. This kind of bullying can get you into serious trouble if the things you say are. The cyber bullying number has incressed rapidly through the past @NUM2 years. In @DATE1 the cyber bullying number was @PERCENT1 of kids school. Now in @DATE2 its gone up to @PERCENT2 of. You being newspaper care. For I will be talking about exercise. Exercise has been a big topic in the last few years because of obesely. Kids become obese because they play video games on the computer more than taking a jog outside, or kicking a soccer ball around. Im not saying kids shoud stop playing video games but video games should be a a week tops. I personaly love to be outside playing soccer but most kids dont. At @ORGANIZATION1 they took a test, this test shows that a weight kids average day is, go to school, go home, play on computer, secred activity for a hour then more computer me away. My last butt certinly not least is the safty of the internet. Many people go on chat rooms. These chat rooms are with total strangers that the computer choses. Some of these people say they are @NUM3 year old girl but you never no. These people @MONTH1 learn your information if you tell them and can track you down. Another thing about the internet is anything you put on the internet will never be erased. Those are my reasons why internet is bad. Thank you."	2073	
2074	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter for you to state my opinion or what computers do to @CAPS1 and yourself. Have people notice what computer are doing? Computers are taking away it alot of to things. There good for the news but when yo do able of other stuff like play video games it gets addicting. I know this first hand because I use to be addicted too. It takes away the fun stuff. You spend less time with family and friends. You don't excersise as much and you can't enjoy nature or a computer! Don't get me wrong, computers are handy but you should only spend little time on them. They have some advantiges like learning about faraway places with a click of the mouse. They're good for planning a vacation with family and friends. I mean looking at sites, finding hotels and more. BUT, like I said before its hard to pull youself off the computer once you've saw something you liked. Computers also take away social skills. I talking about online dating. You're not interacting with people in a face to face. Also same of these online websites have predators. They will seem trustworthy until the find out where you live then they'll kidnap you, then rape you, then most likely kill you. Do you want this to happen to you?! I'm no, would you want this to happen to you're children? Let me guess, same answer. So stay off the computer as much a possible."	2074	
2075	1	"I actually think that computers are good for people. I think this because cmputers give you a lot of information. Say that you are doing a social studies project on @LOCATION1 and you need alot of detail on it you need a flag what its goverment is like and much more stuff like that. The computer is an excellent way of gettig alot of accurate information about what you are researching. Also it is good for just relaxing and playing games when you have free time. Also I dont really follow about what theyre saying about people are spending too much time on their computer for example theyre not exercising, enjoying nature or interacting with family or friends for the family and friends because on the internet you could talk with your family, say they are on vacation in @LOCATION2 and they left you alone at your house, you could set up a video link or just write to them, asking them how theyre doing. And the same thing with your friends. And instead of spending youre whole day on a computer do what I do. First you should make a list of whatever you need to be done. Then set a time that you could manage to do all of this. For example during the @DATE1 before my seventh grade year I had a little list that said @NUM1 to @NUM2 eat breakfast @NUM3 to @NUM4 work eat @NUM4 to @NUM6 play my playstation three. For the whole @NUM7 to @NUM8 months of @DATE1 I folliwee this schedule. Then when my dad get home I would go ask him if I could go ride my bike with my friends. Then I would take a shower eat again then I would go on my computer so if everyone had theyre priorities finished before they went on a computer they would have any problems. But overall I think that computers are a very good way of getting research or school work done. Also for chatting with your friends or just relaxing or playing games. Also I really think that it does teach hand eye coordination so when youre typing yuo dont have to keep looking down at the keyboard then back up at the monitor. So this is why I think computers are good for you if you have a well running schedule."	2075	
2076	1	"People use computers for many things, some people use them for tickets and more. Some time's a computer can shut down or can catch a viruse. People can lose there importent file's. Kids spend more time on the computer because they don't want to go outside. Computers can help you sort out things and help kids with there homework or an aplaction for high school. People spend to much money on the internet bill for spending to much time on the computers. Computer's can break down and you have to buy a new one for a lot of money. More people buy computers because there starting to build t.v. in them."	2076	
2077	1	"Dear Local newspaper. I'm writing this letter to the Local newspaper to give my opinion on the affects computer have on people. I think people can learn in the computers more and more every day. I think is an opportunity for some people to meet other poeple in differents part of the world. People can learn differents cultures on the websites. Is you continue reading I will give you more details on my reason. I think people can learn on the computer because. We can learn about other peoples cultures. People can look for information on the @CAPS1 when they need it. And its good for school projects because you can look for information in the @CAPS1. Thats why people can learn with computers. I said you can learn different cultures because. We can meet people different then us and we can learn about there culture. We can look for websites on the @CAPS1 that has information for different cultures. And we can tock about our cultures on the website. And that is why you can learn different cultures. I said you can meet people because. There are a lot of website that you can meet people. You can chat with people on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1 ect. You see new people every day that wants to be you're friend. And those people can become something for you. You can meet people from around the world. Some times people spend a lot of time on the @CAPS1. but thats there problem because that means that they don't have nothing to do. And I think is good because on a website you can be you're self like if you have a myspace you c an put it whatever you like it. And people should be more responsible. Thanks for reading my letter."	2077	
2078	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are benefical to @CAPS1 society, and helped bring @CAPS1 society to where it is today. It has helped advance technology, communication, and information. Without the computers, @CAPS1 race would not be as fan as it is today. The computer was a great advance in technology, which led to new advances. After the computer was invented, people learned how to make touch screeens for the computers. This was something beyond anyones imagination! With theese computers, restaurants have become tons more efficiant with seating people. Another advance is learning games. Most people think that kids spending a lof of time on the computer was a bad thing. With theese learning games, this is not entirely true kids can learn new things at home and not just at school. Studies show that kids who play theese games at home do @PERCENT1 better in school than at home. Wouldn't you want your kids to do that well in school? This dosen't exactly mean kids should spend all their time on the computer. They should still spend a good amount of time playing outside. Before computers were invented, the only way to communicate with someone was to call them, or write a letter. If we didn't have computers, theese would still be the only way. Calling someone for every little thing you need to tell them could end up costing a lot money. Writing a letter takes time, and even more time for the person to get it. With computers has came email. Your email gets sent to your friend in less than a minute, and is free of cost. You can send documents to people that would normaly cost money to ship from fedex or @ORGANIZATION3. Furthermore, with inventions likes @ORGANIZATION2, all you need is a webcam and you can video chat with somebody for free. Now instead of visiting relatives every time you want to or have to see them, you can vidieo chat with them. One of the greatest inventions that came from the computer is the internet. This is one of the things that has made humans smarter. You can get accurate, up to date information on the internet. An encyclopedia isn't always up to date and cannot update information daily like the internet. Although people believe that you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer, the internet can help you to get outdoors. You can look online for vacation spots, and plan your vacation on the internet. @PERSON1, a mother of four says, ""@CAPS1 last few trips, we use the internet to plan @CAPS1 vacation, and they were the best trips we have had."" People will argue that kids spend, too much time on the computer and not enough time playing sports or exercising. With new awarness of this, there are computer adds everywhere advising kids to go outside. Computers are bennefical to @CAPS1 society and helped bring @CAPS1 race to where we ar today. Without computers, wheve would we be today? "	2078	
2079	1	"Some @MONTH1 think that computers are no good for your brain or what not, but I beg to differ. I believe that computers can actually emprove your brain function because it works on your hand-eye coordination and also enforms you on any subject you can posibly think of. It also allows you to communicate with family and friends. People say that sitting in front of that computer screen is just wearing you away, but what they might not know is that it can improve your hand eye coordiantion. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people use a computer tend to have better hand-eye coordination than someone that doesn'@CAPS1. There is also brain games you can play on the computers to not only be entertaining but also work out your brain function and educate you at the same time. You might think that you can'@CAPS1 get anything out of using a silly computer but the truth is you can learn anything imaginable on the computer. You find out things from centeries ago, say on any war or historical event, to your favorite book that just resently published. it can also enform you on the local news incase you missed the news on @CAPS1.V. You want to keep in contact with friends or family more often, well if you had a computer, you can do so. Theres all kinds of ways to keep in contact from aim, to myspace, to facebook. You can instant message or email anyone of you choose. So you can the excuse well I couldn'd get in contact because if you have a computer than you could at any time. To conclude my statement I feel that a computer can give a positive effect on people."	2079	
2080	1	"Dear local newspaper, More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I don't agree with the thinking that we are spending too much time on these computers and time enjoying nature and with family and friends. My first reason why i don't agree with in because you would not about far away places and people. My second reason is because the computer allowed you to talk to friends and family that don't live new you. Third is because without computer technology we wouldn't be able to learn at much. Computer technology is very important without it as you can see many of especially studies teachers wouldn't be able to learn much and teach as much about many places and people. It is very important to know about different places and cultures because when we grow up we wouldn't know many things about cultures. By using the computer and learning about places it @MONTH1 be one of the places we might want to visit when we grow up. This is the first reason why i don't agree with the experts. My second reason why i don't agree with the experts is because the computer to talk to friends and family. Its always important to keep in touch with family and friends that don't live near you that way you know how they are doing. By using the internet you @MONTH1 even new friends and get to know more people. There are many days when people are bored so they just go on the computer and chat. Although you wouldn't know who the real person you're with is it's good to have a good time talking to them. My last reason why i don't agree with the experts is because without computer technology we wouldn't even have computer classes. No matter if you are using the computer you are still exercising your fingers the keyboard and processing is for. In school we do many projects in computer that help us learn about people cultured or article life. This my last reason on why i don't agree with the experts. I have explained three reason why i don't agree with the exports thinking that we are spending too much time on our computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and entercating with family and friends. My three reasons were that by using the computers we got to learn about far away and people, we also get to talk to friends and family that don't live and we also get to learn more with them then without computer tech. I hope the experts change their minds."	2080	
2081	1	"Dear Newspaper, This is a very exciting prompt. Most people agree that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have position effect on people. They tech hand-eye coodinations it give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computers and less exercising, doing homework, enjoy nature and spending time after school or in a program. We need to resolve this issue because people give the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Withou no doubt, why do you think people like going online? For example, @PERCENT1 of people rather stay on myspace, facebook, and yahoo. What do you think people do on these computers? Furthermore, what do you think the computer effect half of these kids? Well its only one way we can solve the issue parents of your child you need to turn you computers of because they spending more time on a computer than school, exercising, homework. @PERCENT1 as these parents allow they kids to talk online to people. Well know you know that @PERCENT1 of your kids like being online talking there friends and family.

2082	1	Dear local newspaper my opinion are that it is good to have computer and it's also bad. Computers are a very advances technology. The reason why I think that computers are good is cause you could do a lot of sotf on them the reason why I think computers are also bad is cause there are bad people that could try to do something to you. My first reason is that computers are very good cause they are a very advances technology they also have a positive effect on people . They also have teach hand - eye and coordination. Another reason is ability to learn new things. You could also learn about faraway places and people. It even allows people to go online and talk to other people. The reasons why I don't think computers are good for people is cause they are spending too much time on their computers. and less time exercising enjoying nature. Another reason is interacting with family and friends. And cause there always be dad people that want to do hamre. Those are the things I think about computers.	2082	
2083	1	"Dear: Newspaper: Computers maybe addicting but they help people lear easyer, they even help people with some disabilities. They also help people socialize with friends they also help get homework done. Computers also help adults with billing and help kind jobs that pay lots of money, and computers are great for children of all ages. Some websites are edecaltional and some are built for fun!!! You cant do any of this without one. I know these things because I use one all the time at home my whole family uses one my cousins mu relitives even my friends it is not good to use it all the time though sometimes it to talked and exercise. Without computers in the world a tone of things would be really really hard to do. If you ever go to get one go for the cheepest price and be really full with it."	2083	
2084	1	"Computers are used all the time. Some people think that we spend way to much time on them, and others think that they have a possitive effect on people. I think they have a positive effect because on computers you can learn, find out about places you've never heard, have fun, and you can even talk to relatives. There are so many things to learn, and computers have so much information. It you are having trouble with any of your school subjects, the internet has answers and explanations. Many people go to college online. It is much easier, and you do the same things you would have to do in the class. Learning how to type is very important. Many jobs need people who can use a computer. The computer has information on all states, cities, and towns. You can go online and learn everything on a place. After learning about the place you might even want to visit. There are also many places online to meat new people. You can make a best friend, online who can become your best friend in the real world. If you don't know alot about a specific holiday, or culture, the internet can help you with that too. The computer has many games also. There are so many to choose from and their fun. It's easy to talk to frends online. You can talk to them about anything and you don't have to pay a phone bill. If you have fmaily members that live far away, or dose, you can talk to them online too. If they live far away then you don't have to pay for a long distance call. If you have a webcam you can even see the person you're talking too. As you can see, computers do alot. The help us learn, meat new people and places, and have computers have a possitive. effect on people, or a negative effect on people?"	2084

These addicts, yes the computer is a drag, maybe out of shape, obese, or even worse their life in peril! My dream is to make sure that the regular faimily home wont be sitting in a chair, but playing outside in the fresh air. As you might of geussed, I know that computers will weaken familys and their health. Computers are handcuffs keeping me inside wich sustains me from getting outside. Computers are the greates distractions from family and friends, leading to bad relationships. Finaly these usless boxes trap you at home not in the world where we can help the enviorment. This and the following I hope will help you understand that we should just throw the box in the trash and get on with our lives. More exersize is needed to sustain a healthy body. Experts from sports ihs strated say that @PERCENT1 of computer users don't get the @NUM1 hour of daily exersize they need. Good exersize is @CAPS4 to sustaing a healthy and risk free body. I know for myself that browsing the web kept me from browsing the streets to gain exersize. I was addicted to the computer and soon become sick. Recent studys shows that over @PERCENT2 of paintants in the hosipital have been caused by computer-related brain damage or exsersire obesely. This clearly shows that throwing out the computer would help all our lives. The computer sible @NUM2 freinds and my mother from me. How? I become addicted and they gave up on me. The computer will distract you more than the love of your life. It is a proven study that over @PERCENT3 of computer users have lost at least one relative of friend. Using the computer takes you away from social : @CAPS5 thing from partys, wedings, or even dinner at your home! The addiction will clearly take someone close to you, trust me. Not many help the enviorment, but shows that @PERCENT4 of the people who don't comit to help out world are addicted to these shaddy machines. Helping the enviorment is key to make us alive, but computers just speed up the process of the earths death. I know their are websites that promote the enviorment but most users, just look at the computer and don't do anything! This needs to stop if we want to save our world. As you can see these usless, or even perilos machines must be shut down. less exersize means more people in the hospital. Like computers do anything to help the family sitution."	2085	
2086	1	"Computers are fountain or knowledge in which the human race has drank from for many years. Some argue that computers are not food for society but they are wrong became they don’t look at the big picture. Computers help society in many ways, two main ways is that it promotes social life and it in as easy way to obtain knowledge about anything in the world. Computers promote social life through ""chat sites"" and other things of the sort. Some popular chat sites are @CAPS1, chatterbox, and chitchat. These sites allow you to talk to your friend without having to waste money and minutes on the phone. Chat sites also help you make more frienfs through friend finder applications. recent studies show that @PERCENT1 of people on chat sites make more than @NUM1 friends per month! There are also other kinds of chat sites such a @NUM2 where you can find the love of you life! When my mother was @NUM3 she met her husband through @NUM2 and now we live in a castle with a.

Through the computer at a click of a button you can know all about the catastrophee of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fun @CAPS4 @LOCATION1 even if you weren't alive at the time! When my brother had to do a project on the flying spaghetti monster he went to the computer and at the click of a button started reading up on the religion straight away. Recent tests show that @PERCENT2 of people that we a computer for research get it more efficiently and in a timely manner than those who don't. Through the computer one is able to find out the weather and other happenings is the world. It is clear that the computer is an easy way to obtain knowledge and help people with research. It is made from the mind that computers do help society through promoting social life and by giving all easy way to obtain knowledge."	2086	
2087	1	"@DATE1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, I remember when my cousins first moved to @LOCATION1. We were concerned that we would lose touch. The four of us were always close. So, when @CAPS5 happened. We no longer needed to worry about drifting apart. That is why computers have a positive effect to the public. Surely you've heard of online communities, such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. These websites allow you to connect with people you @MONTH1 not always see. Certainly that helps people who have moved away up to date with friends and family. When someone has that closeness they feel happier. This general happiness leads to a better society. Secondly, computers are educational. By using them you can develop a more advanced hand eye cordination skill. Another example is that computers help you do research. If you have a science fair project, a computer makes research easier. @ORGANIZATION2 helps millions of people everyday. Yet another reason is that computers can be very useful. Like stated earlier, they assist you in doing research. Also, using this technology can help organize your documents. Essays can be written on programs like @ORGANIZATION1. Certainly that would help in school. To conclude, computers are positive technology for society. Social networks unite families. Research is made easier for everyone. Lastly, they simply help you. This is why I say that modern technology is a wonderful gift to society."	2087	
2088	1	"I think that computers have a good effect on people for many reasons. First, they teach hand eye coordination. Next, they give people a easier way to learn about far away places. Lastly, they alow people to talk online to other people. First, computers teach hand eye cordination because using a mouse dose it. Also, as simple as it sounds, using hand eye coridnation is very important. Hand eye condnation is a skill that is nearly impossible to live without. @PERCENT1 of people say that computers help with hand eye cordination. Some computers also have special games just to improve hand eye coridnation. Plus hand eye coridination helps you with many things like; sports, school, and even basic everyday stuff like throwing something away. Another reason why computers are important is that it gives people opportunities to learn about far away places and people. Having computers is like having a world wide history, science, and math book at you finger tips. When I mforgot something at school. I know I always had my computers so that I could upload my assiment. In my school we are learning about @LOCATION1 and with computers we were able to look up everything from what kind of food they are to were they would hold secret meetings. Computers help us study and learn about other country's easily. Lastly, computers alow people to talk to other people online @PERCENT2 of teens they talk to all theyre friends online. Having the ability to talk to other people online is a very good luxuary. Other countries are still trying to develope the software to even make computers and since we have already done all that why take them away? Plus being able to talk to jeny so you can get the homework you missed will really help. So in conclusion, having computers is a privelege that we should take advantage of. They teach hand eye coridnation, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and people, and even alows people to talk to one in other. I demand that computer stay a positive use of line and are continued to be used the right way."	2088

2090	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I heard you guys are talking about how people spend to much time on the computer than excercising, enjoying nature, spending time with familys and friends, I think that is wrong to but let me tell you three reasons why it is good to spend time on the computer. The three reasons are why it is good to spend more time on the computer, what does the computer do to your study's and how the computer helps you in life. It is good to spend more time on the computer because a lot of people around the world even adults use computers to help search for websites on the computer for their needs and kids search for games or even history on the computer for their school work or to just spend time looking at the pictures. Thats why kids spend more time on the computer than spend time outside or with their parents. Parents got to understand that the computer is to study and raise for a living not to play games, if the kids spend so much time on the computer playing games than fine you can complain take then off the computer and tell them thats enough computer for one day but if there doing something interesting like geographics way on the internet or then you can let them go and enjoy helping them or just watch and see what they are doing on the computer, so if they need you can help them with stuff. The computer is for studys not for games the computer is a high technology system to help us with our needs. The computer is good for studys and if you are complaining about the time they are spending on the computer then let them go because you should if they are playing or just studying for a project or a quiz because the computer will help them in life and if you take that a way from them then they will struggle when they get to high school or even collage. I suppose so thats why you parents should let them study on the computer than you helping them you might say some answer wrong they check on the internet they don't know wich one to believe so let them by themselves it willbe easy work for you parents out there. The computer helps you in life by giving you the education for the real world when you go to work a computer then they might think he is a smart guy on the computer than the parents will be proud so thats why the computer is important. So I think the local @CAPS1 letter should take this saying underedvisment for you."	2090	
2092	1	"Dear, local newspaper, I am writing to you because I've recently heard that experts are concerd that people arent spending time outside enjoying nature. Also not interacting with family and friends. And they computers are no good but I disagree with this some kids like myself go on the computer to find fun group games to play outside. Some people who dont have computers still dont exercis or go out side. And my last reason I disagree is because some people dont live near any one in there family so they use the coumpter to keep in contact. My first reason why I disagree with the expers that say people with computers dont exercisi or go outside is, many kid like me and my sister get board easily. So we go on the computer and look up fun games we can play outside with the kids in the neighboorhood. I have a computer and I spend most of my time outside play fun games. Most people dont have computers and most likley they dont exercisi either, would you agree? My second reason why i disagree with experts is some people dont have a computer and they dont go outside. They would rather watch some show on tv. Then play outside in the sun running around playing with other kids. Its not just computers it tv, movies, dvds, cds all the games system they beep them inside. But many people need coumpters also. Local newspaper my third reason why i dont agree with experts when they say they don't interacts with friend or family is because some people dont live by family or some friends have moved away. Newspaper you @MONTH1 not know this but some people have cameras on the coumpter and you can talk to some while looking at them and you dont have to type and it better to see a friend/family member then just hear these voice. These are my three reasons why i disagree with the experts. Get game ideas, some people dont have one and still dont go outside, family easier to talks to an compter so please local newspaper agree with me on this computer subject."	2092	
2093	1	"Computers are one of the worlds most important peices of technology. They benefit our lives in many ways, but yet some people don't think that. I am not one of them. Computers are a great peice of technology because you can learn more easily, talk with your friends, and you can get things you want easier. Computers make learning much easier. Now most of our textbooks for school are online. Now students don't have to worry about forgetting books at home, or lugging around @NUM1 + pound backpacks. Also, for people who aren't in school, you can look information up online. This not only saves you a trip to a library or book store, but would also save money on gas or the cost of a book at a bookstore. That is how computers make learning easier. Computers are also useful because you can talk and socialize with your friends easier. You can show your friends pictures with the click of a button, that normally they would have to go to your house to see. You can also go into chat rooms with several of your friends. This saves the time of calling each friend individually when trying to make plans or sharing info. That is how computers make socializing with friends easier. Finally, because of computers, we can get things we want a lot easier. Suppose there is a item you need to replace in your home, but no stores have the one you want in stock. Instead of going through the hassel of going from store to store searching for it, you can just hop on your computer and select from thousands of choices. You can also save money, because often internet prices are cheaper than the store's price. You also don't have to worry about large items fitting in your. The item will be delivered to your home, and you can even get assistance to set it up. How convienient is that? Computers are a great convienience. Even though they @MONTH1 keep us away from nature, we have to make that choice ourselves computers are great because they make learning easier, make socializing easier, and make getting things you want easier. They basically make like a whole lot easier."	2093	
2094	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I beleive that people are on there computers to much and that they are not looking out the window so that they can get some sun light or fresh air. So if you know someone that does that all to much do your best to help them before its to late! Now a days I think that they are all just on those computers and are emailing, or I.M.ing, or playing some stuiped computer games. I also strongly beleive that they are doing less homework and there grades are going down little by little and now shcools might be strugling now because of that. I also think that the websites are bad like addikting games, all they have is curses and gun's. even more than @PERCENT1 of the school distrect plays the games. Computers have only brought are socity down little by little leaving some of us blank. To learn more stay on your computer and in no time you will go blank, and before you know you are never going to get off your computer and you will never see the world agein. But the world can stop that. How? Go outside and see the rest of the world and stay away from your computer as much as possible, and before you know it you @MONTH1 never use it as much as never."	2094	
2095	1	"Four out of five people in the world own a computer. Computers are becoming part of human civilization. Many experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People are becoming adicted to computers. Therefore, people are spending to much time on computers and not exercising. Almost @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obease. These people don't go out and excercise. Obeasity is a major problem affecting many people. When people spend time on computers they become addicted and don't want to go out to excersise. Excersising at least @NUM3 hours a day is essentional for a human body. Being on a computer for too long can damage the way people think. Studies show that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people that spend everyday on a computer are not able to concentrate. Computers can also damage the ability to see. Many people have told you not watch t.v. up close but whats the difference with looking at a computer up close. Light that comes froma computer goes directly to the humans eye. This can damage a persons carnia ( a layer over the eye) and make it harder for people to see. All though people have computers, computers shouldn't be used a lot. There are so many wonders in the world. For instance the worlds nature. People miss out on this because they are to bessy on doing work home on their computers. Now people can e-mail work from work to home. People get distracted and never take a vacation. With on week someone can visit another country and get to know it. Nature helps calm down a person from to much stress just like yoga does. Statistices show how people can calmthemselves from just getting to know a place that is natures. People that spend time on their computer look at pictures from other places instead of visiting the place. Not only are computers pulling people away from nature but also from their family and friends. Two out of three people live far away from their family. Computers are getting people distracted from getting together as a family. On computers people can chat but what if the other person doesn't know how to write or read. Visiting is a better way to get to see a family member. You get to see them personally and remember their faces. When you have a friend you usually get seperated during college. During college brake you can visit a friend to know what is happening and what charged. No matter how computers become it wilol never be better than a human. Life might be cheaper is you spend it on computers. Instead of paying a trip you can talk on the internet and instead of paper you can save it on a hard drive. Computers aren't everything in the world. Before computers were invented families were closer and had a better relationship also people knew the contrymone. I hope people react and spend less time on their computers. There are many beauties in the world that humans are ment to see so don't spend it on an electronic that can hurt you."	2095	
2096	1	"Dear, Newspaper company I believe people should spend less time using computers and more time with their family, when your on the computer all day you don't get enough exercise, and you can attract online predators. Spending time with your family is valuable because you can share how your day went, what was new in your life and how you are doing academicly. But when your on the computer all day you can't enjoy any of those things because you are to concerned whats on that monitor. You can miss out on whatching movies, going to exciting places, and even parties because you are to busy playing games on the computer. When your on the computer all day you can miss the thing that really make you happy. Exercise is very important in a healthy life style but do you get exercise when your eating chips and chating with a friend? I didn't think so. When you don't exercise you can become obese. Twenty percent of kids that spend more than an hour on the computer are obese and don't get enough exercise. When you spend hours on end using the computer it cant be healthy. Also when you use the computer to much you can end private chat rooms. You can meet people that are friends but you can met people who pretend to be your friend. The people are called online predators. They pretend to be your friends and if you believe them for too long they can ask you if you want to meet. This is a very bad mistake because if you go you can be abducted or kidnapped. So dont meet someone without telling a parent or gaurdian. Because you can be abducted. When your in a chat room you have no way of knowing of the person when you are talking to is really your friend or someone who wants to hurt you. And if you spend less time on the computer you can mind the chances of happening to you. So dont let your life pass gone by and spend time with your family, get exercise and stay away from chat rooms if you really know who you are talking to. These are the three of many reasons why you should spend more time with your family."	2096	
2097	1	"Dear @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 editor, @CAPS2 residents here in @LOCATION2, @STATE1 are split between whether or not advances in technology @CAPS2 have a positive or a negative affect on @DATE1's society. However, I strongly agree with those who have stated advances in @DATE1's technology are crucial for even survival. To test this, computers can allow for communication with others, further education, and even teaching hand eye coordination. To begin, in most cases, relatives and friends @MONTH1 live far away from same citizens. They can't constantly visit or call each other every - day. @CAPS8, what do they do? Easy solution: each person hops onto the couch, grabs their @CAPS3 computer, opens @CAPS4, and chats away. Similarly, I have relatives and friends who live in @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 I don't always see them. Without computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my best friend @PERSON2, or my cousins @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. Thanks to @CAPS5, an instant messager website, and @CAPS4, we wouldn't be able to keep up with what happens daily in each other's lives. Also, @PERCENT1 of most @CAPS7 use the computer to talk with their family and friends daily. Apparently, computer usage for talking with friends and family was become a necessity. In addition, computers are required even for education. @DATE1's students of @LOCATION3 are basically all using computers for online college courses, (like my brother @PERSON4 who goes to @ORGANIZATION1), help with homework, and even for researching places around the world, like @LOCATION4, for that history assignment are next week. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""In @DATE1's world @CAPS2 colleges are too far away and @CAPS2 students don't want to travel too far away. @CAPS8, they just go online to our website and type away at all of their essays and tests and quizzes.""@CAPS8, computers are the most turned to device for educational research and homework topics. Finally, there are educational games on websites such as, pbskids.org, for yourger children to teach them hand-eye coordination, and subjects to get them @CAPS9-@CAPS10 ready such as learning to count and singing their ""@CAPS11's"". Teaching these subjects is important because the younger the kid is that you hach, the more likely they are to grasp the subject and continue to learn more efficiently. to conclude, advances in @DATE1's technology (computers) is a necessity for all learning and future education. @CAPS8, what are you waiting for? Grab your @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION2 laptop or even your bell computer and let's get educated!"	2097	
2098	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are very beneficial to our society. They help us with Hand-eye coordination, Allow people to learn about for away places, and if a sibling or friend is away places, and it a sibling or friend is out of town. No problem you can talk online. Hand eye coordination is very helpful it makes it easier to type for those monster papers you hear all about from college students. It also makes it easier to play sports like baseball or football. Have you ever tried to catch a baseball without your eyes and hands coordinating? It's like trying to catch a scared grease pig, almost impossible. Sewing requires lots of Hand eye coordination so when your in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 you'll be glad you took those computer lessons. With @CAPS1 you can go anywhere with @ORGANIZATION2 you can visit steamy @CAPS4, @PERSON1 beaches, and the tallest peak of any mountain. You learn about everything and just at the click a mouse. When you have to get information for an essay paper where do you go? Thats right your computer you find out everything there. Can you imagine teachers used to look things up in books. Now all you need to do is type in you search term and click enter. Easy as pie. When your friend is out of town or your parent or sibling don't you wish you could talk to them. Well you can just go to you video laptop and get on there and talk away. Don't you hate it when you forget to write down a piece of @CAPS5 well now instead of missing that huge @CAPS5 assignment. Just get on your email and ask a friend. Don't you get tired of hearing your parents yell at you for their telephone bill. Well not anymore you can chat with a friend to meet up for sodas anytime now. So obviously @CAPS1 are very important you learn Hand eye c coordination, you learn about places every where and you can talk to familey and friends anytime, anywhere."	2098	
2099	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to inform you about the issue we are all having questions about on computers. I am a student, however, I do understand how much useful computers can be to future generations. The internet allows us to gain world @CAPS2, allows interaction with family and friends from different place, and it's a great source for education. I hope that after reading this letter, you will agree with me not only as a student but as adult as well. Computers are not only used for games and fun or even chatting with friends but it give future adults the world @CAPS2 they need to gets good jobs, maybe even form alliances with other countries. As a student, I often use the internet to provide me resource on whats is happening all over the world, not only about what is happening on the state or around @LOCATION2. Going to sites like @CAPS3.com, @CAPS4.com, etc gives everybody on edco or  of what different countries are having a crisis about or how they are building good with neigboring countries, even with @CAPS5.S.D the international headlines are a key source of @CAPS2 that does appear on some the internal vast varily of what is happening currently or live in the world with, headlines and even more without would @CAPS2, we can brights only for but, adults today can a different the world, whether it's sharing being of author ; it makes is huge is pool. The internet not only allows us to gain world @CAPS2 but entertain. My father always gets currently through the computer they get to email each other and have some good times; it's the only way my father with her friend. people all around the world want to know about how their mother, father, aunt, uncle, etc are on another country or province. Recently in the news, it @CAPS6, @LOCATION1 interacting with @CAPS7 with the the internet. We get to @CAPS8 they are doing okay and it satisfied the close family and friends knowing that @CAPS9 can be used always in there are must keep our relationship strong and ; we have to use the internet for emmile or computer compare to internet will lives around the world. The last reason, the internet is very useful us for purposes. Computers allows people and to and to school. For handle there are used for accounting, kerring chorts and graphs. It allows us to do things than the hard way things. more efficiently and with accurate information work and projects are also done finished. In conclusion, it can be sad that with the it makes work much. It allows us to gain world @CAPS2 information with family and friends and for education purposes. PS you have it will make your country and future a bright. I hope that after reading this letter you @MONTH1 hopefully agree with my opinion."	2099	
2100	1	Dear Newspaper I think about computers more people use the computers everyday but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Because those who support advances in technology believe that computres have a positive effect of people and I think that is true because some people use the computers all day they don't do nothing only in the computer some childrens use the computers but they talk with others people they don't know who is them the childrens have a problems with the eyes because they are only in the computers and that effect yours eyes. Another things is the childrens met with other people in the computer but they don't know who is them that person want too met each other then that children go to that they don't know who is them that person adapted that children they can use the violence with that children they can call to the parents and say if they give don't money your children can died and that is the more problems in the world with the childrens or in the family. I agree with other people they can use the computer @NUM1 minutes or less but not all day I think the parents can do to go out with childrens going to the park others thing but not in the house and all dau in the computers I think that all the problems we have with the computers with the family and I think you too think the so please think that think about happen to the childrens and other people and peolple thing taht too they think is most better the do that to the family think that what I say effects to others people to use the computers all day please only think what I say.	2100	
2101	1	"Almost every family has a computer in their house lots of kids spend a lot of time on the computer, and not outside. Adults are also on it trying to email each other. People are on computers to much. Mostly teens are on the computers. They are always checking facebook or are playing games online. Those kids are on the computer and are not trying to exercise. The parents should have a time limit for the kids on the computer. They should be alward to use it if they need to look something up for school. Other wise they need to be outside running or out with friends. Kids are not the only people spending hours on the computer. Adults are on it too. They are emailing each other and seeing if they want to go out for dinner. Adults are also on dating websites. The looking at pictures and people profiles. Not that is on these websites. Some people need time off of the computer go outside play a game of football with their friends or just go play a game of poker to get off the computer. Computers can make people forget about exercise. All they care about is taking to their friends on facebook or going on the online dating. Many people are not exercising and are sitting on the computer all day. If everyone. like the whole country would be obease. Computers need a time limit on them. Once you are on to cons then it will shut down and there is nothing you can do about it. Those are some ideias about why computers are not good. Rember do you what your country to go obease."	2101	
2102	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would you guys feel if your child was being cyber bullyed on the computer, or mabey someone you love such as a husband, wife or or a big brother or sister was now addicted to certain things on the computer because thats all they want to do? Well, I believe that many americans bday are even turning obese because of the computer, which is why I strongly believe the man made computers have negative effect on many people, for the reasons placed above. In todays life, the average american sits on the computer for about @NUM1 hours per week. This is not only bad for our health, it can lead to cyber bullying. Studies show that over @NUM2 americans are cyber bullied every month. This in turn can caused chain reaction that can lead to . For example, in @DATE1 a @NUM3 year old girl was @PERSON1 bullied on the computer it had and just couldn't take it any. Its easy to see why many with one on the fact computers effect but it is of things. The computer addiction. For example, many ader each the computer to example time passes it @CAPS2 thein to loose. Ther @CAPS3 and became @CAPS4. Their family they will be bery stressed out. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 americans will become obese do to the computer. While they are inside sitting their big buts on the computer the other @NUM6 are going for a walk or jog. Imagine what this will do to the @NUM4 americans in the long run. They will become obese and many internal problems will develop. Obese is one of the killers in america so if computers are contributing to this why do others still argue that we should have them around? It now or never this is the time for you to decide wheather or not computers are good for the human population, keep in mind that it causes addictions, obesity and cyber bulling."	2102	
2103	1	"These surely is a mixed view of the role that computers have on our society. A lot of people feel that they are something we can not live without. My personal view is that they are hazadous to society because of the lack of exercising, online predators, and lack of own family time. Hey, I say if america thrived without computers, there is no indispotable evidence that it can not happen again. Firstly, computers have given society @CAPS1 excuse to not exercise. I find it add that for the past @NUM1 years, when computers were first released, obesity has risen to such a high level to where it is a national concern. To say that the two are unrelated makes no sense. It's pretty much saying that hey computers have been out for @NUM1 years, land obesity has risen during that time to a very high extent, but obviously the two are not related. As you can tell, that statement make no apparent sense, and again proves that computers are doing more harm then good in today's society, @CAPS1 bad effect computer it has been giving to today's public is the easy access for online predators. Though this @MONTH1 seem a bit extreme, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. On social-networking sites like facebook, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, where everyone accepts friends requests and can list their hometown, age and gender, it leaves the option for online predators everywhere, and makes it that much easier to be abducted. Also, a new site called formspring allows for anyone to post anonymously on you ""wall"" saying whatever they want. Since you are never sure who is messaging you, it leaves the door open wide for an online predator. The increasing number of child abductions has increased since the creation of computers, again proving computer's dangers. A last reason why computer's are hazardous to society is because it has caused for lack of family interaction. You might be thinking, well i @CAPS4 my cousins everyday, so i'm actually talking more. What i mean is immediate family, mom, dad, siblings. Studies have shown that families are spending less time together. You have kids who play video games all day, eat dinner with their family, and go back to video games. Family ""talk"" time is no more, family game nights have pretty much been terminated, and even family movie night's are decreasing because you can watch whatever you want on your computer with the simple push of a button. The endless possibilites of computers cause for a lack of family time. In conclusion, computers have become hazardous to our society. Though i will admit they are in moderation. For the sake of health, safety and family, computer use needs to be reduced."	2103	
2104	1	"Dear Newspaper @NUM1 Computers are like a way of life, every person in the world uses them to chat with friends, write papers, and look something up. It was a great technological advancement. Computers make writing faster, the also make talking to friends easier, and they give people something to do. Without computers in our lives people wouldnt have vary much too. Taking away computers will lead to video games being taken away. Computers make our every day life styles a whole lot eaiser, which is why they should stay in our every day lifes. Computers make writing faster @PERCENT2 of people use the computer to write things like reports, or papers says a google survey and my teacher @PERSON1 even says ""without computers the grades would be chaos,"" computers are the answers to many things so therefor @CAPS1 should keep them in our schools, office buldings, and houses. In addition to making writing easier, computers make talking to friends eaiser. If you don't have a friends number you can email them or facebook them and get it from them, even if your a shy person and you want to ask someone got you can do it are the computer. You can also past pics of you an your friends, and do tons of cool stuff. In addition to making writhing faster, giving students the opportunity to chat with friends is great @PERCENT1 of students love the idea and so do my teachers,"" @CAPS1 love to talk to each other and make plans to go out."" @CAPS2 are last reason why computers were a great technological advancement is because what if it was raining and you had nothing to do you could go online chat with friends or even look up videos. When it's raining I usually go on facebook or on itunes as download music, without computers @PERCENT3 of people wouldn't like music as much as they do now say @CAPS3.com my friend lizey even says ""I tunes and facebook are great i don't know what would do without them."" I conclude that computes were a great technological advancement, because of many benefits it has to offer, it makes writing faster, it makes talking to friends easier, and it gives you something to do on a rainy day. I love computers and so do @PERCENT3 of americancs. They were a great advancement and i can't wait to c whats next in store for technology."	2104	
2105	1	"Dear local newspaper, more and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that they benefit society. The use of computers has greatly contributed to the weight issue in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 cannot find the time to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air, and they almost never see their family or friends. Computers have a negative effect on people and must be used less frequently. First off, computers are a minus for @CAPS1 because they can become addicting and @CAPS1 people do not receive their much needed exersize. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of computer users only get about three hours of exersize each week. Which is far below the minumum. in addition, @PERSON2, a children’s physician stated, “@CAPS1 people think that computers are harmless to their health, but actually, when children sit at the computer for hours, fat is building up on their bodies, which quickly leads to obeisity.” @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 displayed an article last week, listing the harmful effects of computer use. They are @CAPS2 on the top @NUM1 list of contributers to weight gain the country. A few minutes turn into hours, and then you are hooked. @CAPS1 never go outside, and don’t get the proper excersize. Although @CAPS1 feel that computers are helpful to society, they have negative effects on the body which can be hurtful. Moreover, computers are a minus because they take up @CAPS1 people’s time, which then does not allow them to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air. Dr @PERSON5, a health specialist has said, “@CAPS3 air and the outdoors are crucial for a growing child’s developement.” @CAPS4 @CAPS3 air, they @MONTH1 grow at a very slow pace, and sadly enough, miss a part of their childhood.” @CAPS5 says that computers are mainly to blame for this issue, and in order to fix it, must be used far less frequently. Additionally, @NUM2 out of @NUM1 adults and children are only outside on an average of two days because they are emailing or using the computer. @PERSON3, a youngman, never went outside except for walking to the mailbox each afternoon. His reason? @CAPS5 was on the computer, emailing , gaming not enjoying the great outdoors. As a result, @CAPS5 grew weak and regreted going outside. One @MONTH1 feel that computers allow the average person to learn of far away places, however, they @CAPS2 take away from their valuable time outdoors. Finally, computers are minus because they take away time to spend with family and friends. CNN.com reported that families in @LOCATION1 are rapidly growing apart due to lack of family dinners and family outings. Reporters point their fingers towards the computers, because this is where @CAPS1 families claim that they spend most of their time. @CAPS2, a recent survey showed that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are lost over the course of six months because they never see each other outside of school. @PERSON1, an @ORGANIZATION2 school student claimed that she and her friend @PERSON4, didn’t speak for over three months, and never noticed because they were always playing games on their computers after school. One @MONTH1 understand why someone else might think that computers teach hand eye coordination, but really they only destroy strong family bonds and potential @PERSON3 lasting friendships. To conclude, computers have a nasty effect on @CAPS1 across @LOCATION1. They have greatly contributed to the lack of exersize, eliminate time in the @CAPS3 air, and loose family and friend time for @CAPS1. Thse negative effects must be known to the public, as @CAPS1 of them use their computers far too much. Please let the facts be known!"	2105	
2106	1	"I think computer do not allways have a positive affect on people. I think this because some people stay on computers. It is very addicting to them. Using computers to much can also get you into alot of trouble. The final reason is because computers can reveal personal information. Do you think computers are bad? Read on and you will find out my opinion on this topic. I think computer can not have a possitve affect by it bring addicting. Some people actualy say it is there life. When something like this is so addicting it keep people on the computers. Sometime people even stay on the computer all day. The reason this is, is because there is so much you can do on the computer. One day I was watching a show and this women said thats all she does is stay on the computer. Then she had to get off the computer and she told her friend to go on and check her email. The women went on the show and the host of the show (@CAPS1) mad her stop for a while. Then she learned that, that is not the only thing. The second reason why I think computer does not always have a positive affect on people is because it gets people in trouble. There is alot of websites that you can go on to talk to friends that you know and dont know. So sometime people take advantage of the fact that they are allowed to do that. So they deside that talking about people is ""ok"". They can get into allot of trouble for this. Not only in trouble with your parents but legal trouble. If there is any bullying online this is know a ""siber bullying"". This is an affence that can probly go down on your record. This is all the reason that add up to why I think computers do not allways have a possitve affect on people. My reason are because they are addicting to people. The next reason is because it can get people into trouble. What do you think? Is it a possitve affect?"	2106	
2107	1	"Today, I write to the local newspaper in spite of an unresolved issue. Should people be spending as much time as they do on their computer? A computer is a great piece of technology, don't get me wrong. But people are spending too much time on them. Did you know that the overage teen spends @NUM1 minutes outside everyday? That's nothing! If we continue the computer obbsesiveness, then our children could grow up to be lazy, fat, and not willing to do work. Is that what we want? It's almost sad that people will look at places online that are within driving range. If you want to go check out that beauty, then get in your and drive there! Two benefits to going for a hike, or going skating is that you get to spend quality time with for family. Family time is one of the most recommended activities because experts say that it motivates your kids to do better in school and will make them feel good. What kind of parents wouldn't their kids to succeed? Another big issue is that is you have a webcam you don't know what you could be getting your teen or preteen into. They could be going on the internet and showing or finding innapropriate pictures of themselves or others. A good way to stop this is to use parental controls. Your kids could grow up to be just a who sits on his computer all day. It's your choice on this parents of cranby, how much computer time you or your family use. You can make yourselves have fun, going on nature likes or skiing. But if you prefer to look online and get as family time, be my guest. Computers shall be not used as much as before and we will have a better environment."	2107	
2108	1	"Not everyone will agree with me when I say, ""Computers benefit society."" @CAPS1 this letter everyone will. Computers help you stay in-touch with friends, allow you to use online textbooks, and play games that help your hand-eye coordination. Jump on board as I tell you about the wonderful affects of computers. Everyone knows it is important to have a well rounded social life, and with the computer that is possible. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 allow you to keep in touch with friends what if your brother or sister went off to college? Sure you could talk to them, but being able to video chat with the help of your computer allows interaction to be exciting. Computers have many benefits in and interaction is just one. The @CAPS3 is at a standstill with polution and all the trees that have been cut down to make textbooks. Computers allow the usage of online textbooks; therefore helping us keep trees alive. I would deffinetly use a computer to look through a textbook the kill twenty-three trees for every kid in my class to have a textbook, written on paper. Also many teachers put homework assignments on school websites, so if you forget to write down homework you could use your computer to look it up. Computers help save our environment and kids who might forgot to write down their homework. Nine out of ten people will agree that hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have in life. Computer games allow you this skill. The keyboard or mouse allows your hands to develope movement, and the movements on the screen allow you eyes to develope strength. By putting the two together while playing a game you allow your hands to move what your eyes are looking at. This helps for a great sense of hand-eye coordination. Games on the computer can be challenging and make you have to use your mind also. The computer lets for many skills with just a couple clicks of a mouse. The computer is a very useful piece of equipment in today's society and helps benefit us. It allows for a wide range of interaction between friends and family. The online textbooks help many people save the trees in our planet, and lastly the computer helps teach hand-eye coordination that allows people to use these skills in everyday life. The computer has benefited our society in more ways then one and many people are thankful for that."	2108	
2109	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this world today many people are either on their computers or outside having a good time. In my opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. They will take time out of your day when you could be doing something else. Instead of looking at computer games, you could be outside enjoying nature around you, interacting with people face to face or exercise. In my mind, we shouldn't even have computers. No matter where you live in the world, there is something @CAPS1 unique around you. It is nature. Nature is one thing in the world that never disappears. If you are spending your day on the computer checking emails or playing games you will never get to see everything that @ORGANIZATION2 has to offer. Another reason why you should enjoy nature is because of all the exotic animals and plants you might see. On a regular basis, you wouldn't see them! It would be great if you saw all the fenominal plants and animals. Especially if it is with your family! Although computers give us an e-mail account, I still think that computers are just ruining out time. You coud be talking with someone on your computer but it would be much better if you could meet them in person. You will be able to get to know the person better and later on get to be great friends with them. Another reason why computers affect your social life is because you won't be able to spend time with your family and friends. If you get really close to your family then they will stay at hotels for the holidays and the more they come and stay in @LOCATION1 the more money the town will get to pay for anything the town needs like a shopping center or repairs on the roads. Plus if everyone is on their computer, no one will be outside in the streets shopping and all the stores will be out of buisness and once you need a new pair of shoes, the shoe store will be long gone before you know it. @CAPS1 it is important to stay close to your family and friends. Everybody loves a great game of basketball or a heart-pounding match of tennis. Well how are you going to be a star of you aren't outside practicing. If you are on your computer all day, you won't be abe to exercise and get the things you need to be healthy. Scientists have tested the amount of people overweight and @PERCENT1 of them said that they played on their computers everyday. Do you want that to happen to you. No I didn't think @CAPS1. All of those people wished that they got outside with their friends when they were young. @CAPS1 overweight people won't be able to socially interest with people and that means no money for the town. @CAPS1 if you want to be a fat couch potato keep up playing on your computer but remember what they said. ""I regret this."" @CAPS1 now you have learned that enjoying nature, interacting with people and exercising is important to live a healthy life. If you are playing on your computer the the whole time, you won't make a living with yourself."	2109	
2110	1	"Take yours eyes of that computer screen and listen for a minute why waste you life @CAPS1 in front of computer screen. When was the last time you ate a healthy meal, went outside, or interacted with family and friends? I can tell by the looks of you that you haven't ate healthy in weeks. Expert nutriest @PERSON2 says ""@CAPS1 in a computer chair eatting junky foods can result in concicenqueces such as death."" @CAPS2 you even know what a threadmill is? My dad wouldn't eat in the morning and then eat pounds of food for dinner, @CAPS3 he got to be really big. Then he exercised and exercised and he lost @NUM1 pounds. That could be @CAPS5 you turn off your computer and @CAPS2 some push-ups. When was the last time you showered? @NUM2? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of the people who shower have a better life. They find parter and get more friends. @CAPS3 be healthy. When was the last time you went outside? All the cool, athletic people are doing some sort of exercise outside like hiking, swimming, and @CAPS4 climbing. Plus who does it hurt to get some fresh air. @PERCENT2 of people who get fresh air are the people who have positive attitudes and get promotions in work. And going out side and exercising can make you live longer. Retired @ORGANIZATION1 pitcher @PERSON1 says,"" @CAPS5 i wasn't a pitcher then i would of been having all kinds of organ failers."" I know that you talk to your family through e-mail and video, but that's not the same as seeing them in person. I can remember when my family from @CAPS6 came to see us. It was on of the best days of my life seeing there @NUM3 little babies and my aunt and uncle. @CAPS2 you spend holidays with your family? That's what makes it the happiest time of the year of course. @PERCENT3 of happy families spend christmas together and they stay out of jail, have wonderful jobs and love each other very much. Have you ever missed a family gathering like a picnic and felt ashame?"	2110	
2111	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is my belief that computers have less positive effect on people! Spending too much time on the computer encourages less exercizing? no one is outside, enjoying nature? Family and friends are being left out. These are the reasons why computers have a less positive effect on people. Spending too much time on the computer encourages less excerzing. This is why this country is high in obisity levels. People spend more time inside. People are becoming unfit. This is becoming very unhealthy! For the reasons above, computers have a less positive effect on people. No one is outside and enjoying the beautiful nature! A breath of fresh air be more every once in a while! People have animals to walk. Going out side brings less depression. @CAPS3 also bring happiness. For the reasons above these are the reasons why, computers have a less positive effect on people. Family and friends are being left out and forgotten. Spending time with family and friends builds socializing skills. @CAPS3 makes you more friendly. Spending quality time is what everyone needs, especially after a long day. A computer could @MONTH1 replace your family. Also, you could make up for lost times. For the reasons above, computers have a less positive effect on people? In conclusion, computers do bring a less than positive effects on people. Less exxerzing, is one negative effect. Staying inside all day and not being able to go nature is another negative effect. Friends and family are being left out and forgotten. These are the why computers bring a less postive effect on people."	2111	
2112	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think being able to use a computer is a good thing because you can talk to friends and family in diffrent contreys. You can also learn how to use technology. Also, with a computer, reasearching can help you learn about diffrent types of things.Have you ever wanderd how your family was and how they are doing when they are on the other side of the world? Well using a computer and going on msn, aim, or even facebook you can talk to your family and friends. This gives you an opertunity to find out how they are doing, and hows it like. Thats one reason I think computers are good. Using a computer helps people learn on how to use technology. Computers are part of technology. So if you learn to use one it will help you with anything else. Learning to use a computer is one of they easiest things. My last reason is that reaserach on a computer will help you learn a lot. For example you wanna know about @CAPS1. You go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in @CAPS1, click on a page and read. You will find lots of information. Computers will help you learn alot! I really think computers are helpful because of these reasons, talking to friends family that live in diffrent contreys, learning on how to use technology and reasearch helps learn alot."	2112	
2113	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I recently read that there is a large controversy over whether or not the use of computers benefits society. I very strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they save trees, allow people to talk online together, and @MONTH1 give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. First and foremost, the use of computers is very green because it saves trees. Many schools have textbooks that are hundreds of pages long and with computers you can access the books online and you wont have to print them anymore. Likewise, many workplaces print thousands of pages of reports everyday, but with computers they can electronically save them and make them accessible to everyone, without printing anything. If you were going to write a letter you would continually have to re-write everytime you made a mistake. However, with computers you can simply make changes without having to re-do the entire letter. Furthermore, with computers there are many different ways to communicate one of the more recent forms of communication over the computer is video-chatting. This is when you can see each other on your computers screen and talk to each other. Also, you can send emails or electronic letters that travel much more quickly than letters. Likewise,  you can ""@CAPS2"" or instant message, which is your similar to texting. Another advantage to using computers is that it is very easy to learn about faraway places and people. My brother had to do a report on a country in @LOCATION1, and he very simply went online and found over one million different websites he could use. You not only can find websites that teach you about the country but you can also find the people or that countries very own websites. Furthermore, you can even learn about places that have disappeared, such as the lost city of @CAPS3. In conclusion, the use of computers has a very positive effect on our society because of how they help us communicate, learn places people and how eco-friendly they are. @CAPS1, some people with an opposing view point @MONTH1 argue that people spend too much time on their computers instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and family. Those people are wrong because you can learn how to exercise on line computer and you can interact with others aswell. The use of computers also teaches hand-eye coordination, a very important skill in life."	2113	
2114	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have recently taken @CAPS1 by storm. The computer has transitioned, and has alserations done to closer its technological perfection. Computers are a quick way to gain knowledge and even purchase items. The computers also an easly accessable communication device. Finally, the computer has numerous programs that can schedule a time period in which you use the computer. Might I say this invention is simply impecable. To begin, the computer is a rapidly quick source to earning knowledge, and even purchasing items. Without a computer @CAPS3 people would have to drive the gasoline powered moter vehicles across country to purchase an important item. Therefor, polluting the planet greatly. Is that what you would like to do to our environment? Computers are a fast way to earning important knowledge. One way is through the very popular search engine ""@CAPS2."" @CAPS3 people search through the @CAPS3 links on the website and almost always find there answer. One the most knowledable can understand that the speed of a computer is a valid reason to believe that the computer is a benefit to society. In addition to being a fast source to knowledge and purchasing items, the computer is an easily accessible communication device. With a webcam attached to a computer a computer transfoms into a virtual telephone. You can physicly see the face of @CAPS3 of your closest friends and family. Yes you call them, but why call when you can see and speak to person you with. A poll was done on every family in @CAPS4 and @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4's own a working computer, and @PERCENT2 of them had a webcam. A mother of two in @LOCATION1 once said ""my children would never get see there father who is currently stationed in @LOCATION2. If it wasnt for our webcam, and computer."" To finalize, the computer comes with programs in which you can schedule time periods where the computers accessible. The programs can shutdown the computer at scheduled times. Therefor you are given an amount of time to participate in nessesary activities such as exercise. Thes programs will leave you with enough time to do what your body requires. Lazy and out of shape people don't use these programs. Yes it doesn't force you to exercise but at that point the choice of exercising or not is up to you. Its very important to use these programs, one reason being without them you will become addicted to your computer and your life will become corrupt. To conclude computers are very benefitial to society. The computer has a very positive effect on people for reasons such as being a fast resource to knowledge, to being a way of communication, and even having programs the shut down your computer at certain times leaving you with ample amount of time to take part in similar to exercising. I want all to do what is best for them and use a computer. Don't be one of the only not smart enough to use one the most inevative, elaborate, inventions to gracefully equipt our society."	2114	
2115	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, I read in TIME magazine that there is an arguement over the negative and positive effects of computers. I think computers are good for our society because it gives people news updates, teaches basic skills, and helps people to communicate. Interested about what's going on in the world, many people look towards computers for news updates. @PERSON5, a farm owner in @LOCATION1, live @NUM1 miles from the nearest town. She does, however own a computer without it she would be lost about what's going on. Millions of people would also be unwitting without a computer. @PERSON3, a scientist of @ORGANIZATION2, also feels this way. He conducted a study on dependency on computers and found that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION3 mostly get news from the computer. Would you like to be in a world where no one knows the news? I wouldn't. With unlimited applications, a computer can easily teach someone a new skill. @PERSON4, a sociology major of @ORGANIZATION1 took a survey around the school and found that people who read from their computer read more often. They also comprehend the information better. Other people also use their computer as a resource for learning. @PERSON6 @CAPS2, a businessman at @ORGANIZATION3 was told to learn how to write letter in cursive or he would lose his job. @PERSON6 immediately went home to his computer and downloaded a software that teaches different types of handwriting. With a new skill, @PERSON6 returned to work the next day and received a promotion. Computers are a fine addition to this world. Stayinhg connected with friends and family is important and using computers is an easy way to do that. @PERSON1, a current student at @LOCATION2, has a very busy schedule. His day consists of classes from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm, followed by dinner and @TIME1 study sessions. He is always busy when his parents are free talk. The only way for communication is by emailing. He can respond whenever he has time and his parents are happy to hear from him. When children go off and grow up, communicating through the computers is simple and easy. Furthermore, a recent study by @PERSON2, a specialist on family, showed that @PERCENT1 of people stay connected to their family with computers. These people are happy to hear from their relatives. As you can see, computers enhance many lives around the world by giving news updates, helping with basic skills, and help to communicate with friends and family. Technology is growing rapidly and other electronics @MONTH1 be bad, but computers are helpful."	2115	
2116	1	"Dear local newspaper I think computers are a good and reasonable resource to many sudjects. My opinion on the matter is that computers are a benefitial asset to urban living. The reasons for this are simple. They teach hand-eye coordination, gives access to learn about exotic faraway lands, are another recource to online comunication. One of my reasons is clearly, online comunication. Since most computers have an ulimited power supply. More power equils more time to chat. If you computer has a webcam, webchats are also an option. Have this give a visual of your chat buddy. E-mail messaging is a quick way to talk with friends. My second reason is one of intelligents. A computer isn't just a toy or entertainment, it's also quick learning experience. The internet is a door to many interesting, exotic, unreachable areas. An example would be if you had a project, the computer would have endless amounts of information. If your looking to book a hotal, visit the hotels website. My final reason is one of my most highly, recognized. Hand-eye coordination is a skill most commonly used. Archers need hand-eye coordination to nail targets the first time. It seems important to most jobs or activities. Basketball players use it to pass, dribble, and shoot. Hand-eye coordination is an assential, key point in the lives of millions. So hand-eye coordination, communication, and learning are only few of the many reasons computers are a benefit to the homes of our people. The time is now. Make the decision. Ask youselves ""@CAPS1 will this effect the future?"""	2116	
2117	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I Have heard that you are concerned that people use the computers too much when they could do other things. I disagree, because there are many things on the computer that could help you. First, find directions to a destination. Also, you are able to look up things that you need for a school project of life. Finally, you can interact with friends far away. as a result, I disagree that people should stop using computers and do other things. When you are lost and need directions, the computer can help. First, if you need to go somewhere and your lost go onto the computer. For example, if you are having trouble with reaching your destination, then go onto google maps and print out some directions to help you. Also, if you are going over to a friends house and don't know where it is, you would look it up on the computer. For instance, instead of using a map the computer prints step-by-step directions to your destination. Finally, if you are starting to drive and don't know your way around, go onto the computer. For example, on the computer, it has every destination in the @LOCATION1 which will help you get used to the city and roads. As you can see, using the computer is a faster/easier way to get directions and find your destinations. When reasearching, not everything is in books. First, you could look up videos, news, images, etc... For example, if you want to check a show or research things, the computer gives you a lot of results. Also, if comes in handy for school work. For example, you are able to type papers and research for projects. Finally, you can register for jobs and buy things on the internet. For example, for researching, you are able to buy tickets to a concert or and jobs. As you can see, using a computer can help you with research, buy things, and more. Interation with friends would be good, to stay in touch when they are far away. First, computer has facebook where you can talk to friends. For example, you can talk when your friend is even in another country far awa. Also, a computer has email too. For example, during work for parents, the can talk with other worker and get information without talking. Finally, it doesn't cost as much as talking on the phone. For instance, talking on the phone could be up to @MONEY1, when on the internet is doesn't cost anything. As a result, people are able to use the computer to stay-in-touch with friends far away. As you can see, there are many reasons why people should be able to use the computer. First, you are able to get directions. Also, research and look up thing for a job or school. Finally, to stay in touch with friends. People should be able to use computers more often."	2117	
2118	1	If think that people computers do not spend all there time on them. Some people work on there computers so those people spend all day on computers but they do go home and interact with there familys. What would we do with out computers? I know your thinking that we don't need computers but they do come in handy sometimes. There fore I think that most people do not spend all there time on comuters. Second I think that computers help a lot with bills finances and paper work. If you owen a bussinass and you don't have an computer theres going to be @NUM1 time's the paper work. My mom and step father owns and run's a truking compine and about @PERCENT1 of the paper work is on an computer. My step father get most his loads coming home on the computer that would be hard to do without it. I know your thinking that what if the computer crashed? That would be a problem then. I think that if you have a bussinas you should have an computer. Third people use computers in personl resons to talk to relitives in other states. I my self email my mom all the time becouse she lives in @LOCATION1 I only see her for @NUM1 month out of the year and the computer is one way we can see each other. I think that computers are good for people.	2118	
2119	1	"Dear Newspaper People, Computers are one if not the greatest invention ever. Computers help people with that work and schoolwork, allow you to talk to family members or friends, and you can even play computer games on a rainy day or if your not feeling to good. Computers are very helpful and very convienint for all ages. School students use computers for all kinds of things like typing up an essay or doing reasearch on the human body. Parents also use computers for work, parents usually if there a banker or a lawier always have a laptop on hand. Computers are also a very easy way to communicate with each other. Adults are always emailing each other about work or about breaking news. Teens and young adults are also constintly. Instant messaging each other about the latest gossip on facebook. Even younger children communicate to each other on club @LOCATION1, where they can chat with friends and play games with them. Computers are one of the best ways to communicate. Also computers can be used to play games like solitaire. On a rainyday when theres not much to do theres nothing better than a good old computer games. You can play with a friend or you can play alone, its just a great way to some time. When it gets boring you can just save that game and go and find a more fun different one. As you can see computers are incredible and could be the greatest creation of all. Because of all fantastic stuff. You can do like studying and working, communication with all of your friends and family, and for being able to play computer games or a rainy day. As you can see computers are incredible."	2119	
2120	1	"Dear newspaper, Computers benefit the high-tech society that we now live in. They provide hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about foreign places and people, also talking with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very useful skill to have. Having a computer can help develop hand-eye coordination. They allow people to look at the screen while typing. This is easier than having to look at the keyboard, then back at the screen. Also having your hand-eye coordination developed by using your computer at home can help with phyisical exercise. People will be better at the sport, for example basketball and they want to go outsidb and play the sport, making them healthy. Computers also help you learn by having the ability to learn about faraway people and places. This can help you with a school project. They libary @MONTH1 be closed, and you need information about a place solve this, you could just go online and look it up. This way you can learn new things much faster than just a book library. A couple weeks ago, there was a big @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 project on the @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 expedition. It was easy because all I had to do was go onto one website. The website had all the information I needed for the whole project. Lastly, computers have social-networking sites. Here you can chat with friends online! some sites, you don't even need. In pay, but you would to talk on the phone. Last night, I had forgotten to write down my was for algebra. I just logged onto my account and asked someone. They answered and it saved me from getting a. Computers are good for the society. Now that you have read this letter, I think you agree."	2120

Therefore, smash that off switch and go live healthy in the wilderness, with your relatives. A common issue the government has is addressing the community with health care reforms. The local scientist of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has been researching a problem over the past twenty years. They have just made it fact that our has gained an additional @NUM1 million people to the obesity list since the @DATE1's. This shows on graphs and data an extra @PERCENT1. A huge cause for this weight gain of citizens is technology. The main reason is in almost every modernized home, the computer. A survey took last week says that many people are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hours each day. We can solve this situation by turning off those brain washing machines. There are many potential diseases if using a computer. As a result, almost @PERCENT2 of strokes and seisures are happening from this terrifying device. You might as well open the door and let them walk right in because by this way of hobbies you are treating your body with no respect. If only people would stop this madness and shutdown these computers to aid in the event of cutting down on the amount of patients that are in the hospitals every day. The wonderful open road! Explore what ever comes in mind because with a soul you have no limit. Don't waste away a perfect and excellent life on videogames and the internet. Burst threw those walls like a bulldozer sinking its teeth into the beautiful light and onto the other side, let there be no more darkness and explore what god gave you. There is absolutley no explanation for sitting in that awful room with only the glow of the computer screen leading your life into nothing. No excuses that I need information for my job or school. All you need is your five senses and nature to give every piece of and you @MONTH1 require. So shut that system dowm and lead your way outside where you will wander the true way of living. Spending time with your friends and family is based on everything. Do you think a life of meeting people and having a blast compares to that rusting chair in the corner of the house playing a game that would get you anywhere in life. I know it doesn't take five hours to check your inbox. Do you know how much families"	2121	
2122	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with you and how people spend to much time on their computers. I think that people waste their lives on the computer. I know that it is good to look up info on the computer sometimes but people can do that and quickly get off instead of staying on. Most people play games and watch videos on the computer for hours, sometimes people can be on the computers for days when they are addicted to it. I think people forget the importance of working out or spending time with their family. One day one of your family members can be gone and you can regret not spending time with them. Also you could gain weight and not lose any calories from sitting at the computer for hours or days. Sometimes its good for you to get some fresh air instead of staying locked up in your house for hours or days. Working out or excersing is also good to do to. You can lose weight or gain muscle. Even taking a break from your computer and going on a quick walk is also good for you. Interacting with friend of enjoying nature help you also learn things instead of looking up nature on the computer. You could see animals, birds, and newplants from looking at nature. Maybe you can get a guide to show the plants and animals. You could walk through the woods or a forest. That way you exercise your legs and enjoy help your environment by picking up garbage or cans that people left in the woods or forest. You could walk lift up things an dhelp the environment, and animals. That way you gain leg strenght, and help out nature, and animals in it. Interacting with family and friends is also a good thing to do. Instead of talking to people on the computer on some internet you dont even know who these people can be. They can end up being really bad person or somebody who could bully you online. but if you interact with family and friend syou know that they are good people, you know that they arent bad people or that they wont bully you. Also interacting with your family and friends can help help with your social skills and that can help you in the future. In conclusion interacting with family and friends, working out is better then staying on the computer. You can lose weight and gain muscle. You can save nature and help your environment, or from interacting you can get better social skills and spend time with your family and friends."	2122	
2123	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that computers have a big effect on people. Computers prevent people from going outside, they becme lazy, and spend less time with their family and friends. No worries thought, I am here to explain the reasons more to you so have a better understanding on computers effecting people. First computers prevent people from going outside. I would think that people might actually want to get fresh air, but i guess not. By them having fresh air @CAPS2 makes their brains think better. also computers make them not able to play with friends. Instead they play games and activities online. All people should see their freinds in person, not just talk to them on the internet. Second, computers make people lazy. When they become lazy they dont excercise or which causes their body to become unhealthy. In fact, our country doesnt really need or can afford for people being unhealthy becasue we are known as the most obeast state. As I said about people, being lazy causes people not to eat right, well @CAPS2's true. People who are on their computers mostly just eat junk food. For example, they might be on a game or talking to a friend, and they want something to eat so they run to the kitchen and get a bag of chips because @CAPS2's quick and easy to get. When instead they could get something real to eat. Most importantly, computers make people spend less time with family and friends. They are on computers all day that @CAPS2 comes down to some not even talking or seeing their mothers, fathers, and even siblings. Now honestyly thats pretty sad to hear. People arent going to be able to bond with friends and family when their upstairs or wherever the computer is. All their be able to do is bond with them online which really isn't the same as in real life. So @CAPS3 again computers have big effects on people because they prevent people from going outside, make people lazy, and makes them spend less time with family and friends. Hopefully I explained the reasons well enough so that they will say something about @CAPS2 in the newspaper. Thanks for listening."	2123	
2124	1	"Dear @CAPS1: I have recently heard that you want to know what kind of effects to people think computers have on them. In the past a survey like this was never taken. I believe a survey needs to be taken. In my opnion, computers have agreat effect on people. First, they teach hand-eye coordination. Now days you need good hand-eye coordiantion for a lot of jobs. You also need it to drive a car. What teaches better hand-eye coordination than a computer? In my past expierences, I have found that computers, for me, are the best things to teach hand-eye coordination. Where would people be today without hand-eye coordiantion or even computers? In a recent survey taken in my town over @PERCENT1 of the people in the town say they don't know where they would be right now if they never got good hand-eye coordiantion from using computers. Even @PERSON1, a human function reaches says that if you want to have a good job then you need hand-eye coordiantion. Second, they give people the ability to learn about far away places without to travel far. This is extremly helpful because if someone is doing a report they don'tt need to travel to @LOCATION1 to learn more about the tiger. Instead they just stay home and use the computer do get all the information they need. Not only is it convient but it also saves you thousands of dollars. It you so much because you don't need to go far to find information about far away places. In fact, according to a survey taken over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of people in ym town sya sthe computer saves them the money and of travelling far away. If you do want to travel, it can help money. @PERSON2, animal reacher says she always is using the computer to time and money. Last, you can talk to people from around the world online. Talking to people online can seen you thousands or more depending on what your job is. If you're a big @CAPS2.E.O. of a company and need to travel around a lot to meet people, you can save lots of money by using a internet chat room. Or if you're a mom and you have to stay home with sick kids you can still be at work online. Using online chat rooms you can still ""go to work"" and take care of the kids. It can even help if you got a flat tire on the way to a meeting. Just go to a internet-cafe and oyu can still use the intenet to be at the meeting. In fact, I use the internet to talk with my friends so the phone bill doesn't go through the roof. In conclusion, I believe computers have a greta effect on people. y reasons are: They teach you good hand-eye coordiantion, you can learn about faraway places without traveling and you can talk to people online. I you to see computers as a good effect. The future of computers is in your hands."	2124	
2125	1	"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people. I belive this because computers are a way of communicating, traveling and people use them if they have a disability. First, computers are a way of communicating. You can get in touch with people near or far. Most of my family lives in @LOCATION1 and no communicate with them I go on video chats. It's just a good way to keep in touch with close ones, and be up to date with them. Second, people use computers for traveling. You can research on places to go, sites to see and transportation such has planes and cars. You can book hotels too. lastly people through a computer or if they are deaf they can. only type this helps doctors their work with disabled people to communicate with them In conclusion, I believe computers have a positive on people because they are used for communicate traveling and for people with disabilities "	2125	
2126	1	"Computors are a is to our society. They are absolutly unimportant, and quiet irrelbuent to the common persons use. Yes, I admit computors are easy for everyday work and is something to keep busy, but all this is preventing young children and adults to do what they have to do to be fit, have a social life and there are plenty more efficient ways to entertain ones self. Exercise is important! It keeps our bodies in shape and keeps us healthy. Computors is a new way of entertainment. This new source of entertainment is making children and adults lazy. Books when the common person didnt have computors they would go out and do something with or make fun outdoor plans. And the younger kids would go outside and play fun active games or play mental enhancing bord games. Due to the common use of computors people aren't getting exercise they need, and thats a problem. People of all ages need friends and a social life to keep happy or to have any encouragement or fun to be to do good things. All people need some sort of social engagement everyonce in a while. Even kids from @NUM1 need to have fun with friends and go out. Computors is stopping kids from and making actuall friends. Computors are a menis to kids who need companionship. Besides computer life there are a ton of ways to entertain ones self. No one deserves to sit and do nothing all day on a computer. It does not teach hand eye coordination. It only dumbs those real down to just clicking a mouse. And what if the electricity stops working? What if all we on was electronics? There would be nothing and people would go into a panic computors are just a and miss oportunity to children. In conclution, computors the healthy growth us physicall activity, computors keep kids and adults from actually doing somthing productive, and finnally, computers. Is not the only way of entertainment. We all need to step away from the computer monitor and yet a life worth liveing and remembring. Stop the dangerous cycle!"	2126	
2127	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 first of all computers are great tecnoligy for the @CAPS2 industry because they give you something to do if your bored. Computers can let any person do what ever they want weather its talking to freinds typing a story or even playing games for fun. But its not a good idea to be on it all day long, every one still needs to go outside and play or go to the park with freinds. Now most of the time people sit on the computer all day and try to droid freinds. Computers are also like a mall online on sites like e-@CAPS3 or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. There is so much stuff on e-@CAPS3, but don't forget going to the town mall is fun to because you can go with friends. One thing a computer can do is if your waiting for something go on the computer most of the time you loose track of time another thing is there are some people that stay on them for hours and hours and not do much with there lifes and there are the people that use it in a good way by doing something for work or buying a stock or some money makeing reason. Computers also have places to find things if your stuck about something like google wikipedia or even dictionary.com to get info on things you don't know. If computers werent invended life would go alot slower. Do I use computers alot yes. Do other people yes and yes I think computers are good because if you band them that would make alot of people very unhappy."	2127	
2128	1	"Dear local news @CAPS1, I think that computers benifit people by hand I coordination, talk to people from a round the @CAPS4, and also learn things like @LOCATION1 having almost the biggest eartquake. Just thing you want to learn. One way people can benifit from the computer is hand - eye coordination so if some one tryes to punch you real fast you can black it. The gym dosent teach you hand - eye coordination. So the computer is the only way to get cat like reflexs. (Hand-eye coordination). And what better way to learn it than on the computer. Another way that the computer benifits you is that you can talk to people. It is actually a great feature. You can talk to people from all over the @CAPS4. So if you knew a person from school and then that person moved some where far away you can still be really close to that freind. You can be in a chat room with as many freind as you want so you can talk and it wont put any money on the cell phone bill or home phone. One of the greatest benifits from the computer is you can learn stuff that you've never heard of. Alot of people didn't know about the @LOCATION1 earthquake untill they went online and found out. Because if they didn't know how would they know what there are far charaties for @CAPS2. So what if they wanted to know how to adobt a @LOCATION1 kid. Well for starters they could go online to find out. And we can go online to find a great gym to @CAPS3 at. Wheather it is ""@CAPS3 out @CAPS4"" or planer fitness you can see all the recomendations so you dont mak a mistake at picking the wrong gym. And those are my reason why I think the computer is good to have around."	2128	
2129	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I just want to let you @CAPS2 that having computers around has a big effect on society. Such as, having citizens all around the world that have stopped exercising. They've also stopped enjoying the little things like nature and listening to the wonderful chirping birds that wake them up in the morning with their melodies. @CAPS7 all we @CAPS2, having computers around could keep the user from interacting with their friends or family. First of all, I want to @CAPS2 what happened to all of the kids who used to be hanging outside with their friends, or walking to the store to get some eggs and cheese @CAPS7 their mom. Oh, that's right! Now I @CAPS2 what happened! They got a computer @CAPS7 their birthday! Not to mention that the percentage @CAPS7 kids being outside with their friends dropped down from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2! Aha! Now, the percentage @CAPS7 kids staying inside on the computer went from @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT4! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Because I'm thinking that that's why we're seeing the @CAPS4 population going up in the world. Secondly, how many families do you see going on hikes and enjoying the nice weather? If I'm lucky I'll probaly see one of @CAPS1 neighbors go camping during the @DATE1 ! Worst of all, @CAPS1 family doesn't even go out @CAPS7 hikes or camping trips ! Every year @CAPS1 parents keep saying that we'll go camping, but when the time comes to go, they postpone to the next year, and the next, and the next. Since that's been going on @CAPS7 three years, I'm not even going to ask if we're camping this year. The worst thing though, is never going out with families anymore. @CAPS7 instance, every-stinking - day when @CAPS1 mom comes home from work guess whre she's going? The computer! But, ever guess what she's going on? Facebook, to update her dumb page! Even better, that's what @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 do in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, that's exactly why I fancy myself with reading, and during the @DATE1 I go outside, take a blanket by down, and read or take a nap. You should even try it one day, and get your glued butt off that nice, soft computer chair. @CAPS6, here's the question. Are you a computer person, or are you not? Because if you are you probaly won't read it, and you'll go back to the computer. However, if you aren't one of those people, maybe just maybe you'll read this and tell your friends and family to get off the computer and take a hike. @CAPS6, please do and while you're at it, lock the door and keep them outside @CAPS7 the day and let them soak in nature. Ok?"	2129

And will have all the information you will need via internet daily life was was once very complicated. The computer makes all of these hassles a thing of the past having a computer is like having resource in world at the palm of your hand. Communication has been very ground breaking in the computer buissness. Rember back in the day were you would have in wait days or weeks just to arrive a letter. You can do it by email via yahoo, aim, or hotmail. This makes things so much easier. You can now send and revice inmportant information or picture eat in a matter or sounds! Not only can you email but you im (instent messae) people with also makes talking to business clents, pamilly or friends ect from across the globe like from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 no hassel no more expe long distance phone calls when you can get all of these awsome facts for free! With just basic coast not only can you comunicate to people around the world in seconds. But also the internet is very entertaining from online games to bloging on facebook, or watching videos on youtube. You dont even have to rent movies anymore because you can get them instently via com the games computer combind with internet will give to all ages inclouding g- @DATE1. witch will give you hours of fun. I have given my facts and intalled information on wht I think the computer is posotive. It makes daily life in general easier. It also makes communication very easy, and the computer offers lots of entertaing things to do/ use like face book, chat rooms, and youtube. All at the click of your fingers. The computer is probly one of the best inventions since cars. The computer is a great tool that should be taken advange of."	2130	
2131	1	"Dear NewsPaper, I am writing this letter to you because the effects computers have on people are lots of people like to go on computers to talk to friends, play games online with other people, and to do online research for school, work, or other companys these are my opinions. My first reason is to talk to friends people talk to friends online because if they don't see them anymore thats their way to communicate with them because they moved away or if they want to do something over the @DATE1 and they need to get a hold of them because they might not have a phone or they just want to have a nice long conversation with a friend because some people like to tell their closs friends about whats happening in their lives if they are getting bullied is having trouble at home the always have someone to to talk with so thats why we have computers to talk to friends. My second reason is to play games with others a lot of people like to play games with people they don't know at all or sometimes people that they don't know because they want to meet new people or try something new and people play games games just for fun and im not talking about games on the internet. Im talking about accual games like for example world of warcraft, counter strike source is a first person game this is another reason why people to play games online. My last reason is to do research for school or work sometimes you go for school and you need to do research on lets say @ORGANIZATION1 or you need to turn in an assignment for your job or your fired this is all I could think for now. I can't think of anything for this reason. I hope you could come to an agreement that computers are really usefull to talk to friends, play games, and do research for school or work."	2131	
2132	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of all the things you can learn on a computer, billions of webpages, filled with information. Computers are very useful, and helpful in our day in age; people use them for fun, school, work, and interest. People rely on computers mostly for safety, connecting with other people, and educaiton/work. Humans coudn't be as intelligent without computers. Computers have a very big effect on people. Of, all the things computers can @CAPS2, protecting our safety is one of the most important. Computers can @CAPS2 many things with weather. Ther can help measure air-pressure, wind speed,and predict tornadoes, hurricanes and many more. And, not only @CAPS2 computers help predict the weather, they help show computer viewers the weather. Any viewer who has a computer, can go on to a weather website, to check what the weather forecast is in their area. Well @CAPS2 you know when you meet someone new? You're a little suspicious? and you want to see if they once where or are a criminal. Computers keep history of criminals, so you can simply type in their name, and a backround check of the person will come up. Lee @CAPS3 says, ""I met this new man in town, he looked nice, but I had to be sure, I backround checked him, and found out he was in jail for burglary, I made sure never to reveal where I lived to him."" Not only @CAPS2 computers help secure your safety, they can help you connect with people all over the world. Billions of people are one computers every day. So, everytime you are on a computer you could meet up with someone who studies something you're interested in.Next many children and adults have family whom they live far away from, They can use the computer to find the relatives number or meet up with them on twitter or facebook. Kids can also find friends whom they had lost touch with. Computers obviously aren't a bad influence on the human race. Did you know students (@PERCENT1) use computers to help with homework? Many useful websites are there for students to help them through a tough homework assignment. Say, if @PERSON1 was having trouble with the word ""el sacapuntas"" in @CAPS4 class. She could go to a @CAPS4 to @CAPS6 dictionary online, and find out it means pencil sharpener. Studies show, kids who use computers to help with their homework get better grades then kids who didn't in a result of @NUM1. Many teachers also use computers to help them teach. They can find extra information about the section they are studying, or find games for their students to play: that connects to their subject of course. Mrs. K says, I am a seventh grade science teacher, I could not live without my computer. I use it for grades and for getting in touch with student's parents and much more."" Computers are necessary for learning. In conclusion, computers are heavily relied on in today's day in age. They keep humans safe, they help people connect with others and help learning. People aren't over using computers, because we need them to survive."	2132	
2133	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am @NUM1-year old student in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Me being a teenager and all you'd probably assume that I love all of the new technology coming out recently. I am however, against it. Once someone gets on the computer, they wont' be offer hours. They are truly missing out on life. Computers users should have limits so that we as a country can improve our health standards, reconnect with friends and family, and protect ourselves from the vicious world of the computer. First of all, our health standards have fallen quite a bit. The obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT1 in the past @NUM2 years. Admit it, our country grows lazier and lazier by the minute when we have new technology to do simple tasks for us. Such as cracking eggs for us! It is unnecessary! I've also noticed that not many kids go outside and play anymore. What happend to going to your neighbor's house and asking them to play kickball? Our lives have been sucked into a black hole that is controlled by a cyber filled world. Gym class @MONTH1 be the only time that some students ever indulge in physical activities. It is time to make our country healthy again just one step at a time. Our second step could relate to reconnecting with family and friends. Secondly, our lives are no longer personal. We share everything with everyone. Take my mom for example. If she wanted to reconnect with high school friends, she could easily go on facebook and type them a message. Sure that's easy but wouldn't it be so much greater if my mom wrote a letter. It adds a more personal touch to whatever my mom wants to say. I'm also positive that the receiver would much rather get a letter than a facebook message. The internet lets you reconect, but the experience of meeting up with the person @MONTH1 lead you to much greater rewards. Not to mention that the internet can be very dangerous. The world of computers can be very dangerous to the unexperienced eye. First of all, there are many cases of cyber bullying. Not only has cyber bullying hurt people's feelings some kids have taken their life because of it. It happens everywhere and it needs to be stopped. Secondly, people put up provocative pictures themselves, which can lead to stalkers or ridicule. Girls and boys can get kidnapped by other people because of this. In some cases, because of the pictures, two people will meet one will ask if they can meet somewhere and then they can get taken, @CAPS3, there are many many hackers. If you input a credit card number on a site, someone could use it to put even more many on the cord. Finally, viruses come around all the time, In order to clean them off or if you have to buy a new computer, it costs a decent amount of money, which you would not want to waste. In conclusion, I believe that people need to limit themselves with how long they spend on the computer, and what they do an it as well. I'm not saying that computers should be banned; people just need to be aware of what they do. Instead of spending three hours on facebook, why not spend half-an-hour on facebook and then go outside, play with their friends, and embrace the sweet scents of nature. Computers can be useful, when used the right way. Until then, we should try to put out a good message of staying fit, getting outside and learning how to do things for ourselves."	2133	
2134	1	"How often do you use a computer? How does computers affect your life? Without a doubt I would say that computers benefit society more than you can imagine for a few reasons. Computers help us connect to the world, learn about many different places, events and cultures and help to spread the word about events or buisness etc. To start computers help us connect to the world. This means that computers allow people to talk online with other people through websites like facebook, twitter, @CAPS1. etc. Even with people around the world, or to your neighbor across the street. This helps people and encourages kids to socialize with other people. Through many people can find or reconnect with people from their. In addition, computers also hold tons of information for children and adults like to find and learn about. The amount of knowledge you can obtain through computers is endless. Even teachers use the internet and computers to reaseach topics that will teach in school. The students also use computers to research topics they learn about in school. When a teacher tells a class to research something approximitly @PERCENT1 use computers and the internet alone. You can learn so much through computers. Furthermore computers can be used to ""spread the word"" about events, business and products. Many buisness use websites to advertise and sell their products. This helps to jumpstart and business which is important in our current schools can also have a website, to tell when scholl events are and what the homework is it you are absent. It is very helpful to the student, and teachers. On the whole I believe that computers benefit society for the reasons stated above."	2134	
2135	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, This letter is in regard to your article on how computers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not help society. I am I firm believer that computers greatly benefit society. Computers allow us to learn about places far away, assist us in learning about nature, and allow us to communicate with people all over the world. Almost every country in the world has access to the @CAPS2. Their governments also have sites which we can learn about. Did you know that in a great study, a set of students were told to find the history of three random countries using the @CAPS2, every student was able to write entire essays using the information recieves. In fact, <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students have access to the @CAPS2. Your article stated that computers do not help us in understanding natures using supercomputers, we have technology capable of performing calculations that would take humans much too long to complete. This way, we can learn about physics, quantum mechanics, electricity and more. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all synthetic elements were discovered using computers? In fact, without a computers ability nto perform advanced calculations in a matter of milliseconds, we would never know how these elements would react in the outside world. Now do you agree with me on the benefits of computing? The @CAPS2 is a great way to communicate with people online. It can talk to practically anyone in the world who has access to the @CAPS2. In fact, <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of users chat with other people online. In a @DATE1 study, @NUM3 adults were told to talk to someone from every country. <@PERCENT1@NUM4> of them were able to complete this task. By now you must realize that computers are a benefit to society and is a tool in discovering secrets of nature allows us to communicate with people and learn."	2135	
2136	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever thought @DATE1 how many children or young women get raped or hurt physically for chating with strangers online? or have you ever thought @DATE1 how many young children @DATE1 adults commit crime by meeting up with someone they don't know on enternet? Have you ever even wondered why your child scores so low on states test or does poorly in their academic class? Many children and adults spend to much time on the computer rather than getting their education and enjoying the short wonderful life we have. I believe that people should spend less time on computers. @CAPS2 will decrease the chances @DATE1 others getting raped or hurt physically, @CAPS2 will increase your childs grades in their academic classes and test scores, and lastly, people will be spending much more time with their family and friends. During @DATE1 a youg man named @PERSON1 was walking home from school in @LOCATION1. As he was walking home a fight had broken at @PERSON1 try to exit the large fight then suddenly a group @DATE1 young men who took part in the fight begin to attack him with a wooden stick. They each litterally beat with the stick, punched him with their fist, and stamped him with their foot. Each @DATE1 the boys begin to run as @CAPS3 friends came after him. @CAPS3 friends begin to pull @PERSON1 into the school building. As they entered @PERSON1 into the building, he sad was gone forever. @PERSON1 was only @NUM1 years old and was an honor student. A few weeks after @CAPS3 brutal death someone who was a bystander at the fight had video recorded the beating @DATE1 @PERSON1. They had past @CAPS2 up on youtube for the world to see. A few years ago a @NUM2 @DATE1 old girl and a @NUM3 @DATE1 old man met on myspace.com. The young girl had lied and claimed to the young man that she was @NUM4 years @DATE1 age and divorce. She and the young man had sex. The young man was sent to court and claims he didn't know she was @NUM2. Now the young man is frighten and nervous that he will be in a jailbait. During the mont @DATE1 @DATE2, a young african american girl named @PERSON2 went to harlem right after speaking to her best friend. She was sent into a building with a group @DATE1 guys her friend had known. These young men tryed to rape her but suddenly she had suffered from an ashma attack and heart attack from being frighten. @PERSON2 was my older cousin by @NUM6 years, her body was left in the building until late @DATE3 @DATE1 @NUM7. Dead at the age @DATE1 @NUM1, her young soul will rest on. Many children in the @LOCATION2. A scare very law on their states test. Many parents wonder are they get enough sleep? Are they studing enough? or should e support them more? Whats making children not want to study is the computer. Many children spend all day and all night on different websites instead @DATE1 doing algebra questions for only @NUM9 mins. The computer keeps people from doing what they are supposed to be doing. Some people are so addicted to the computer they don't even spend time with their families. If people don't spend so much time on computer they be more focus in."	2136	
2137	1	"I think people use the computer for many reasons. Frist of all because you get to meet People online and you get to chat whit them. My second reason is that you could find infromation faster. My last reason is that you can do a lot of things. I think many People use the computers. specially because they get to meet people. But mostly young People use the computers because they get to chat whit there freinds. you get to @CAPS3 them better. Theres a'lot of websites that people use to find freind. For example @CAPS1, yahoo, facebok and many more. So theres a lot of people send you freind @CAPS2 and they get to @CAPS3 you and you get to @CAPS3 them. My second reason. Is one of the most and reason I's because they use the about . So you go to use the internet to find that imformation. So thas one of the ways that People use the computers. My last reason of why computers are so important. Is because you dont only use the computers to meet new People. Or find imformation about what ever you looking for. But you could also do many thing. for example play games, @CAPS4 stoff online. But you could also look for anything you want to look even if you want to find a resepy. You see whit computer you can do many things. So those are my reasons why I think computers are so important. You get to meet new People make lot of freinds. You get to find a lot of imformation on the assigment they give you. And last because in the computer you could do many things you want to do."	2137	
2138	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think its bad for people to keep going on the computers because people wont get enough exercise, hang out with friends and family. It will also break the bond between you and you'r family, and friendships with friends, it will only happen if you'r glued to the seat and stare at the screen all day. It can be good to, for little kids, well not even little kids, adults to sometimes need help with keyboarding for at least one hour ady, so they all can pay with friends and chill with the family for a little. Whenever the kids and adults have time to practise, they, you don't have to do every single day, or not right when you get get home from work or school. It is also bad cause your missing out on a lot of things, for example.......... Sports, softball/baseball, soccer, basketball, you will miss all of that. Now about when a friend calls and asks you if you want to come over, because she's having a sleep over with a lot of other friends, and it's going to be school much fun! But your going to be sooooo much fun! But your going to say no because the computer is sure much better. Everyone is going to start ignoring you, no ones going to sit next to you at lunch. Soon your parents are going to benn you from the computer and say ""you can go on the computer no more, you can only go on it for @NUM1 mins, to only check your e-mail,...... you are going to spend time with the family and your friends, and going back to playing sports. The story is about, if kids and adults need help with key boarding then they can at teast go on for only an hour, if they have time. Finally, staying on the computer @NUM2 everyday can affect your friendship and your bond with your family."	2138	
2139	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing to have in a household, so I agree with the people who support this decision. I think they are great to have in households or anyhwere, where the public can use them because they can help us in many ways. The ways computers help us are if we need to contact other people, you can do all your finances and things on computors and you can also play many educational games. Contacting other people on a computor is very easy and helpful. You could contact other people from e-mail, calling, text messaging, video chats, etc. But e-mail is probably the most common way. You would think texting or calling was but scientists took a survey and every @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people use e-mail for contacting people more often. Also on the computor you can do video chats video chatting is another way of talking to someone but also being able to see his or her face at the same time. Another reason as to why people refere to computers for contacting other people is because not everyone has a cell phone. So the only way they can reach them is by e-emailing. Now the list of contacting people could go on for days since theres so many ways you can do that but i'm going to move and the ability they have for educational purposes. Computers have so many different websites for educational purposes. They have worksheets, quizes, games, etc. Also they have all thoughs types of examples for different kinds of languages. you could learn how to write and/or read in different languages on computers. Sometimes my school teachers will asign us websites to do for homework(educational websites). Scientists figured out more students learn better or understand better by playing / doing online work for homework instead of doing worksheets all the time. So computers also make it easy for teachers when teaching a lesson in class and they have games and websites for it. If we miss days of school the teacher could also just assign homework for us to do so use could just check her webpage for that stuff, if we don't have computers then their'd be no way the teachers could do that. My family, maybe even your families too, we normally book vacations from the internet. We look for the place we would like to travel to then we find a hotel and book it straight from the web. The website already has pictures and everything you won't even need a telephone! Statistics show that every @NUM3 out of @NUM1 families/people use the internet to book vacations and things. If you book a hotel and need to get on a plane to get there you also have the ability to do that from the computers, too. Computers can be a very fast and efficant way to get things done which could be very useful and helpful. Computers also help reduce driving, it can save you money on gas. Computers can help you in ways you wouldn't imagine."	2139	
2140	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am weiting to you to tell you. My opinion on the effects computers have on people. First I would like to start off ny saying computers are a good resourse. Some adults use the computer to do taxes and advance check books. Another way the computer is used as a resource as teenagers who are seniors in and out of high school have to apply for colleges online. Others apply for campus jobs as well to help pay twoition. Secondly some people say if you stay on the computer long you'll lose contact with family and friends. Well what if you have a relative in lets say florida and you live in @LOCATION1 you'll want to stay in touch. Plus you wont be able to drive down there with gas prices what the are. Flying is an option, but its also expensive. Other times people mail letters but wait a long time for one back. Lastly people who have jobs want promotion. But cant take it simply because they need a high school diploma or they didnt the third grade. Well they could look online to find the best highschool in the state for a shot at that promotion. Alsp if people need a job they could find a nice paying one in another or in area. Thank you for your time."	2140	
2141	1	"Do you think that computers are a benifactor? Some people say they teach hand-eye coordiation, and talk online with other people. I dont think so, I think computers are a waste of time. You can hang out with friends, stay in the house all day and missing good times. Now reasearch shows that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 uses the comupter. Now who has a facebook, myspace, or any social network? We all do. Now how many hours are you on it, two or mabey four? I think I made one point lets go on how computers are bad. When's the last time you went with your friends? A day, three days? Get off the computer you're friends are probly mad at you. It's time to log off facebook, myspace..ect and you need to go outside with your friends to play tag football, manhunt... ect. If you stay on that computer to long and avoid you're friend it's bad and you don't want to learn the hard way because you wont have friends. How about your faimly. The last time you're faimly was down you will ask you're self ""I'll go when I'm done with this level. ""You wont trust me you will get sucked into the game like a vacume cleaner clean your floor. That are that cant come out of the carpet thats you because the vacume cleaner is still sucking you in untill its all gone. Stop getting caught up in you're games online or facebook stop relax and hang out with you're friends treat them to diner and samthing. You jus have to get off the computer and go before someone is gone. Next step is you're missing. Did you miss a party latley because you were online playing a addictive game what about that high school reunion? You miss a lot of things when you are in a trance by the computer. Outside you see your friends playing football and you say ""I'll join them after I finish the game"" by the time you finished it is eight o'clock and everyone is in bed sleeping. You probably missed a fun game and you didn't get any exercise. Have you thought about it? Is the computer good or is it just getting in our way. Next time you're friends, faimly come knock on the door for you even if it's just to play football or hang out shut the laptop hop of the chair and be with friends and faimly always keep that in the back of youre head. I hope you got a good idea of what is happing to kids and mabey you so lets never log back on the computer again."	2141	
2142	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 my gosh that was so funny, and did you see what she was wearing. That was an example at how meaningless time is being wasted away on the computers as far as doing silly thing such as social networking, instint messaging, emailing and such more! Now dont get me rong if you do this for a liveing to support a family by working with computers. I agree with that @PERCENT1. For other indeviduals this is a differant case; when these indeiduals get no important over all benifit. I think every one can benifit by spending more on your time exersising one setting active. Also becuse when you spend less time on the computer then I think the counts of syber bullying would decrease dramaticaly. Finaly I think that over all it would increase family's to come together and spend quality time. First I think that spending less time on computers would be a good thing becuse we have to face the fact over a half of the @ORGANIZATION1 is obease. So instead of being on the computer its very smart to go outside and get some exercise, play some sports, and even if you have a dog take him/her for a nice walk. People dont realize doing such can benifit more than just you. Some of the people who support advances in technology. Say that the computer teaches hand eye coordination well you know what else going to the park and play catch with a base ball or foot ball (ex). Next I think that with less time being spent on the computer I expect there to be a dramatic change in bullying which can help also prevent the of sexual preditors becase this change would not just benifit children but every one to feel more safe. Finaly, And I think this argument is best of all. This will give familys a push to spend more time together. I know for a fact that the most important thing in a childs life is family even though one @MONTH1 not think so it is and if every family has a chance to do so than I think this will result in a better futer for every one. As you can see, over all I think by stoping time spent on computers. This will result. In family spending more time together. Less syber bullying. And going out and exersizing/getting fresh air. Thank you!"	2142	
2143	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I agree that computers sould be used because of the cool things that it could do like you can get on myspace, facebook, youtube, and other cool sites but let get to the deal people used computer because it help them learn better and see everyting and you get to talk to people all over the world but for me. I like to get on the computer to check myspace on other thing but i think that people love to get on the computer because it dont matter if they do they exercising or not cause with out computers people will have to do a hole lot of writing but with computers. You could do everything i feel like people love to use computers in this life time"	2143	
2144	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. i am @NUM1 years old and a student at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 I am writing this letter because I think computers benefit society. In @CAPS2 opinion I think they have a positive affect. in this letter I will tell you all the reasons why, so keep reading and I hope you fell the same way when you finish. @CAPS2 first reason is that computers allow you to talk online with other people. For example, when I go on the computer I meet new people that I would never met without a computer. Last week on facebook I found @CAPS2 friend that ive lost contact with and havn't spoken to for years. I have recently read on the internet that about every @NUM2 relationship started out by meeting each other online. @CAPS2 second reason is that it gives you ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am assigned to do a project about any country, place, or people I can use the internet for help. This would make me know more about something and understand it better. A couple months ago I had a social studies project due on the thirteen colonies, without a computer I wouldn't have a clue what to write about. Having the internet makes everything easier. @CAPS2 third reason is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I use the computer I dont need to look down to type. This helped @CAPS2 brain memorize the key board. With this kind of skill you would have more job opportunities. @DATE1, I was watching the news and have heard that over @PERCENT1 of the jobs now a days involve computers. Someone might say that they are concerned about people spending too much time on computers and less time exercising. However, I dont agree with this at all smart and healthy,people find a way to do both. For example, alot of @CAPS2 friend spend most of their time online chatting or browsing the internet, but they find sometime to go out for a walk or play same sports. In conclusion, I think computers benefit the society because they are able to talk to others online, learn about places and people, and teach them hand-eye coordination. I hope you agree with me reading this and change your mind if you thought differently."	2144	
2145	1	"Although computers can be very helpful, there are many negative effects that they can have on people. Chatting online can be dangerous, people spend too much time using them, and they cost money. There are many more reasons why computers can cause problems, but these are some of the main concerns. If you're not careful, chatting online can become very dangerous. Especially younger children that don't know better, using a website where you can chat to people can become an issue fast. Sometimes people pretend they are someone they aren't, and if you give out too much personal information, then something serious can happen. You can never know for sure who you're talking to, or what you might be getting yourself into. Many people spend too much of their time on the computer, which @MONTH1 cause many problems. If your on the computer in all of your spare time, then how can you get anything else done. Exercising is one problem. If you don't exercise enough, then you could gain weight fast which would bring additional issues. Also, being on the computer too much can cause problems for you in school. Since you're on the computer from the time you get home, until you have to go to bed when do you do homework? This can cause many problems. For example, your slip. If this happens then you might class. If you fail you might have to go to summer school, or even worse. Stay. When that happens you're parents will most likely get mad at you, and you your priviledges for the, even if you do. A computers cause many problems because of the cost. Computers cost a lot but then you have the paper and ink. Plus, if you have any teenagers in the house, they will probably want to have their in computer or a . If you get the to use it you @MONTH1 not even it. Some of my friends have a webcam and use it on a website they thought was free, but it actually costs extra money after a certain amount of days. With the way the economy is now, people don't have money to buy computers and all the accesseries that are wanted with them because it is not a necessity. And if you already have a computer then you know how much everything costs, and it can get very expensive very quickly. These are the many reasons why I think that computers have many negative effects. Chatting is very dangerous because you can never know who the person is really like. It can take up too much time and not allow you to do what is important like exercising or even doing homework, and finally, it costs way too much money and with the way the economy is. People losing jobs and not having any money, its no longer a neccessity. You could live without one, so why go through the trouble of getting one, and creating all those risks for yourself."	2145	
2146	1	"Computers have advanced a lot over time. They've gone from being the size of a room to practically hand held. But are computers always a good thing? Computers can be very bad and addicting. Books are @CAPS1 as good as computers are to find information. Think about all the computers hackers taht could claw their way into your personal information on the computer. Have computers really made a big positive impact on our world at all? Your mom calls you down for dinner, but you say, ""@CAPS1 a minute! I'm on the computer!"". Computers can be very addictive. There are games and websites on a computer that can suck you in, and you wouldn't even realize it. Spending so much time on the computer takes away from doing other activities, like exercise. Did you know that more than fifty percent of frequent computer-users are overweight or obese? This is because they like their computer's so much, they don't find any time to exercise. Is this a good impact to our society? When you walk into a library lately, you see more people researching on the computer rather than at a table with an encyclopedia or a book. Books hold the same (and sometimes more) amount of information as the internet does. People choose the internet over books because they like the high-tech feelig of the internet, or now they can flip to a new page with the click of a mouse. Books are more practically and you can't copy and paste words right from the back onto your article, so there's a smaller chance of copyright. Books are the better choice over the internet. You have @CAPS1 recieved a call from your banker telling you that all you money has been taking from your account. As you listen in shock, your banker explains that since you use the internet to pay your bills, someone hacked into your account and made a withdrawl. All the money you've been saving for years and years is suddenly gone. All because the internet is an easier and faster way to pay your bill. But the technique of ""hacking"" into a computer grew @CAPS1 as fast as the computer itself did. Ten percent of people who put personal information (such as social security numbers, bank account passwords, etc.) into their computer end up having their money taken away by a hacker. That puts a bad effect on people's lives, society, and computers. Computers do not a big positive impact on society. People become easily addicted, causing many problems for themselves. Using a computer as a research - tool can sometimes be more complicated than @CAPS1 using a book. Paying bills or using a computer to file any personal information can eventually make many financial problems for people later on in life. Computers are not good for our society, or the world."	2146	
2147	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention of more and more people use computers, and less time exercising, enjoying nature, with family and friends. I personally disagree about about this opinion. In addition, not only @CAPS1 will affect of how people are attracted to computers, but @CAPS1 will also affect of how people have to work on there computers. If this opinion was agreed for the people, this will hurt our lives of doing variety things on the computers. My first main reason of why many people use computers but less time doing other things which is because of how people have to work on there computers for there job. There are almost about @PERCENT1 people that I've seen before that there doing different variety things on the computer, in the library and I've seen my father always working on the computer to print & send out fliers & checks his messages (e-mail) on the internet. @CAPS1 always happens to people because there jobs are slow, losing there employers, or etc. The final main reason of why people are using computers but less time doing other things to, is because of how people are attracted to use the computers. For example, there many people especially children and teens like to use the computers is because they can play games on the internet, listen to music, watch videos, write documents, or play games on the @CAPS2-@CAPS3 discs. This has accured for a long time because people or kids don't know what is wrong and what is the right thing to do. If you choose to use the computers for your entire life, ask yourself one or two questions, what would happen if you choose not to use the to help with something? or what will you do in your life?"	2147	
2148	1	"@DATE1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I don't think that there is a single thing wrong with computers. They allow teenagers like me, to talk to family & friends out of state, without bringing up the phone bill. There's nothing you can't find on the computer now-a-days, and not to mention, all the cool stuff you can do with them. Just think about it, not being able to see or talk to you family and your friends. That would be terrible for me, mainly because I have a tight bond with both. Computers allowed me to see and talk to my aunt in @LOCATION1, for seven years with a webcam, how awesome is that?! It's the same exact thing with my friends too! When they leave the state I always talk to them via computer. Technology has and thats definatly @PERCENT1 for the best! Instead of bringing up the phone bill, & talking on the phone, just buy a webcam & instead of just talking to them, you'll be able to see them too! Just try it, look up anything & everything, I'd bet you'll find it. When I have to do projects, I can do them in a flash! All I need is google by my side! Since they made internet available on cell phones & iPods, I have that internet with me everywhere I go. I just find it amazing how much the world changed since my parents were kids! If I wanted to name all the cool stuff on the computers, then I wouldn't be able to fit it on the page, so I wont. But, you could buy your favorite things online, you can play games, and interact with people. Interacting with people is great, because you learn to make a new friend, while your in the process of doing just that! In conclusion, computers do benefit everybody. Theres so much more stuff they can do, I can't even name them all! So, @PERSON1, next time you want to talk to someone out of state on the phone, think about what you could do to save some money in this low economy. I know I said this before, but technology has gone so far, & is improving every step of the way."	2148	
2149	1	"Advances in technology would have a positive affect on people. Think about it, computers could help hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and allow people to talk to other people online. Computers would most definetly be a positive affect on people. As mentioned, computers would help hand eye coordination. This is very important when playing a sport. Baseball for instince players need to catch a ball that is trying at them they need to be able to catch it. same when hitting. Computers would teach people to have hand eye coordination and they would want to go outside and play, which also is good exercise. Think about this with computers kids would instead of being home doing nothing be outside playing a sport just because they were on a computer. Dont you think computers are a good idea? Also a computer would help kids get better at typeing. This is not only good now but when they grow up and get used if that job is being a consultant for a company they will have to do alot of typing. If the person is not good at typing then they probably will get tired. If the person had a computer then when they grow up they will be a better typer and not get tired. Do you really want to see someone not get u job just because there were no computers? Computers help people succed in the life and its is all do to computers. Besides, hand eye coordination, computers give people the ability to learn about farway paces and people. The computer gives people the ability to serf the web to find out cool and interesting details about places that they would be able to unless they had a computer, The computer would give the person a whole sheet or more of details about the place or even a person. I remember last year I was wondering what does my country I was born in look like? I looked on the web and sure enough it gave me a whole buntch of pictures and details about my country. I would have never been able to find that with a book. Also the computer helps with school. The teacher might assigned a paper and has have to use a computer to find the information. If has don't have a computer then you just that assignment. The computer helps students get work done in there house and not in a library. Computer help in many ways but if helps learn which is one of the most things. Finally, the computer gives you an opportunity to chat to people online. Some people have friends that they dont know number and so when they go online and chat with them they get the number. Without to computer they would have never gotten the number. Also maybe you havent talked to someone in a longtime and now with online chat you can. In maybe you cant talk about something but you can write in type in the computer can let you with one of your best friends and then you can tell them and feel much better about yourself then it all in, computer is one cool machine and not only will it let you surf the web but it. Will give a chance to chat online with one of your best friends. To sum up, computers are a sofisticated machine but would have a positive affect people. They help people with hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk to each other online. The computer at first might seem like a bad idea but if young think positive it will turnout positive. The computer would most defitely affect the people in a good way. In any case like this is there? Really a bad side to having a computer?"	2149	
2150	1	"Now a days everyone has their own computer weather you share it with the family or not. People are spending more time on the computer then they are exercizing or getting outside. Most people dont realize it but they actually take away from family bonding time. I have to say they are helpful when it comes to homework. Since computers keep getting more and more advanced over the years, the games that you can play on them are incredible! But do you really want to stock inside all day on the computers? Instead, on the weekends or even in spare time, get outside and start exercizing. It is so much healthier to atleast go outside and kick the soccer ball around then to be inside with your eyes glued to the computer, playing some shooting game once you have been sitting on a chair all day and only moving your fingers around will only make someone lazier. Therefore they will have no desire or energy to get ou and be active. Do you like spending time with your family? Well, I know I love it once in a while. When people are up in their rooms playing games on their computer, they could be spending quality time wich their familys. Some people I know would rather stay in their rooms/houses or stay to be on their computers, but I know that I would much rather be outside with my family. Doesnt it get so boring to hear your family say how much fun they had and you werent there? I sure would get bored of ir. Next time someone says 'no' to some family bonding time, they should think about how much more fun it would be with them, then in your room. I have to say one thing, computers come in verry handy when it comes to homework. Say someone forgets there @CAPS1 text book at home, you can just log in to a website and there, your looking right at your text book but on the computer. If someone doesnt understand s homework assignment, you can just go right online and ask a friend how to do it, and instead of getting half credit, you will get full credit. I have done this alot of times, when you have to research something to understand it better, you use the computer for that too! There are plenty of ups and downs about computers, but I think that as long as you use your time wisely with computers, they come in verry handy."	2150	
2151	1	"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, I feel that computers are a good thing for our society, they help us answer everyday questions and research faster, they help us communicate with distant people and they make school work easier. These are just a few reasons on why I like computers and you should to. See, computers help us answer anything due tomorro on @PERSON1 but I left my text book at home. All I have to do is log on to google and search his name, More than @NUM1 websites pop up giving me enough information to do my assignment. @PERCENT1 of people agree with me that computers are very helpfull. however, reasearch is not the only thing computers can do for you @CAPS2 you are a member, of a social networking site like myspace or facebook or have a program like oovoo, then you can live message chat with anyone else using the site as well. some even offer video chat so you can have a conversation face to face while your in texas and your friend your video chatting with is in china. Computers bring the world together in an @CAPS1 way. Surprsingly,there is still more these amazing machines can do, @CAPS2 you have programs such as microsoft word than you can easily create essays and add fun pictures edited on your photoshop software and use screening effects and animations to make your project come to life. You can get your school work done faster, and then when you're done just e-mail it to your teacher then you dont have to worry about misplacing your assignment. I hope my information was a help to you, computers are an important part of oue lives the certanly shouldnt control them and constantly keep us away from family and friends, but they help us so much and can make working easier and more fun! thank you."	2151	
2152	1	"Can you imagine a world without computers? People would have a hard time contacting one another, for business or pleasure. We would lose acess to music videos, and even games that entertain us. Most importantly, we would not be able to gain the knowledge and information a computer can provide. This is why I believe computers benefit society. As you know, computers allow communication. From email, to instant messaging, and even web cam chats. The computer is one of our key sources of communication. @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 own a computer. @PERCENT2 use their computer to communicate for their job. They send memos, questions documents, and general information using email. Without computers we would have to send these things by mail which is much slower, and costs more. However, computer, can also be used to communicate with friends for fun. Computers provide great ways to connect with others. Computers also provide us with entertainment. With computers we have acess to music, videos, and games. Before computers radio was the easiest way to listen to music. The only problem was you would have to wait for the radio station to play the sing you wanted to hear. But with a computer all you need to do is buy it off of itunes for @MONEY1, and you can listen to it forever. You could even type the song name in on @ORGANIZATION2 and listen to it free from a safe trusted site. If you prefer radio you can listen to live streaming radio from your computer for free! Computers also provide videos for free. You could get on @CAPS1 and watch someone pull of a crazy stunt or watch a new hit music video. Or you could head over to a sports network site and watch the highlights from the big game you missed yesterday. You can even watch episodes of your favorite television shows for free. Computers even allow acess to free online games. One of the best ways computers are used is to find information. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts say the internet provides some of the best information available. This includes recipes, facts, maps, stories, and much more. For example, if you wanted to know ""how to change a tire"" all you need to do is search for it on @ORGANIZATION2, and plenty results will appear. Maybe you want to know about the customs of the @ORGANIZATION1. Again, all you need to do is search for it to instantly be provided with more information than you need. Why waste time searching through a book when you could have it instantly. Hopefully the reasons I have provided you have convinced you that computers benefit society. They allow communication, provide entertainment, and give acess to information."	2152	
2153	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers benefit society and have great effects on people for a few reasons. It is easier to type than to write, it increanses typing skills, and strengthens and helps hand and eye coordination in people. First of all, while some people find it easy to write by hand others might find it easier to type. It is more efficient to type on a computer than with a @CAPS1. Also if you use the computer it is faster if typing is a good skill that you might have. Some people don't know where they make a mistakes and @MONTH1 have to go back and. However on a computer, grammar and spelling errors are underlined and there is no erasing. You have to do just a button and your errors are fixed easily. The second reason why typing on a computer is better than writing by hand is it increases typing skills. People that have not used the computer can increase their skills.For example, where their fingers go and how @CAPS2 they can type. being used to writing with a @CAPS1 all the time it could be different using a computers especially if computers were not invented back in the day. It could be a change for People who writing with a than setting on the command using a keyboard to type. The final reason why computer is more efficient than by @CAPS1 is hand and eye coordination. People who have trouble using the computer. It helps your eyes follow the screen and your more across this keyboard. The wrap it up, I personally think that an increase in typing, being easier than writing and hand and eye coordination nuse you have to write something to think your and try using the it really helps."	2153	
2154	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. Primarily, @CAPS3 teaches hand-eye coordination. This skill is very useful to every one throughout their life. Also, @CAPS3 allows people to learn about far away places and see what they look like with out paying for the trip. Moreover, @CAPS3 allows everyone to connect with family who live far away. As you can see, computers play a huge role in society today. To begin, computers teach hand-eye coordination. Not only will this skill be needed to use computers but allso durring every day life. Personally, I think that @CAPS3 is great kids start learning how to type at a young age. ""I am only @NUM1 years old and I allready have @CAPS1 typing skills mastered,"" said @CAPS2. That is very impressive because mostly elderly people don't have that ability. The reason for that is they did not have that type of technology. What I find interesting is about @PERCENT1 of people from that generation are just starting to catch on to computers. Actually, @CAPS1 opinion is just begining to understand. For christmas @CAPS1 parents bought her a laptop. Some times when we are visiting her I help to teach her. Pretty soon she will be sending out emails just as fast as kids @CAPS4 now. @CAPS3 is like she missed the train and is trying to. To continue, computers allow acess to the world. part of the day is spent talking and dealing with face to face. By using the computer you can see and talk to relatives and friends that live far away. The ""webcam"" is a great invention because @CAPS3 enables you to actually see the person on the other end. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS3 is so cool to be able to see @CAPS1 grandparents. We used to only visit once or twice a year because they live in @LOCATION1, but now we see them atleast once a week!"" @CAPS4 you see the benifits to using computers on a daily basis? I agree that the amount of time spent on them should be kept to a mininum, but in @NUM2 minutes a day really going to effect peoples life styles that much? To summarize, computers are an exellent idea. They introduce new skills to children that can be used every day. They can put these skills to use when they are one get jobs. Physically you are preparing palm fox entering the work force. Also, they help us learn new information on just about anything. Research has became a ""snap"" in other words @CAPS3 is quite simple. Finally, they enable us to keep in touch with relatives who live far away. These amazing machines are our future, so why not embrace @CAPS3? Thank you for listening."	2154	
2155	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have recently heard that you are searching for solid oppinions on the effects @MONEY1 computers. Mainly, oppinions on whether they are good or bad. I know for a fact that the help computers provide has become an essential for most @MONEY1 the people in @LOCATION1. Computers provide entertainment in all catagories, including games, videos and so much more. ""@ORGANIZATION1"" is a search-engine on the internet that has @MONEY1 @MONEY1 links and addresses that bring you where you need to go. The website is like thousands @MONEY1 newspapers, phone books, encyclopedias, and dictionaries combined. Not to mention how much the modern computer helps at even the simplest @MONEY1 jobs. The computer is a neccesary tool for assistance in life. Most people think that computers are making children these days overweight. The computer does just a few more things than the television. The television has videos and movies. It also has the internet and games when a video game console is wired to it. If any case, televisions are doing just as much damage, if not more! I can guess that more than ninety percent @MONEY1 homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer or laptop with internet. A computer with internet is a gateway to various kinds @MONEY1 wonderful things. You can talk to friends through social messaging networks or by looking at them via video conference. There are hundreds @MONEY1 popular video game website. Shopping online has become very popular. ""@CAPS1 and @CAPS2"" even allows you to buy grocceries from home on their website. You @CAPS3 is a website where anybody can post videoes about anything! All these different helpful and entertaining tools have been said, but I haven't even talked about the number one! @ORGANIZATION1 is a website where you type in something, for instance, ""video game"", and thousands @MONEY1 results will pop up with websites, advertisements, maps, definitions, videos and other things. You name it and @ORGANIZATION1 has it. @ORGANIZATION1 is the number one most famous website in the world. It make @MONEY1 a year from around the world. @ORGANIZATION1 buys, sells, has videos, pictures, maps, links, advertisments, e-mails, recipies, phone numbers, measurements, translations, definitions, and so much more that if I continued I would have gone about three more lines down. @ORGANIZATION1 is amazing. After reading about my point @MONEY1 view on computer, I hope that you can now see through my eyes. Computers are efficient, helpful, entertaining, and just plain awesome."	2155	
2156	1	"Dear ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,"" Some experts believe that computers persuade people to stay indoors, and not go outside to play. I do not agree with this. First of all using computers is the number one way to communicate. Secondly, reading or watching @CAPS3 on line could be more helpful then reading a newspaper. Lastly, games people play on a computer are fun, but they can @CAPS4 help with a persons hand-eye coordination and reflexes. These are three ways that computers have a positive effect on people. When @NUM1 people were surveyed @PERCENT1 of them said they used the computer to communicate with friends, family, and coworizers. One way to communicate online is e-mail. E-mail is used everywhere for sports teams, jobs, school, etc. My mother can't go a day with out checking her e-mail. On her email is @CAPS3 about me and my brothers sports, our school, my family, and my mom's job. Email is mainly used by aduldts. Kids, such as myself, use social networking sights. For example: facebook, twitter, and myspace. I have a facebook and it is so helpful. I'm able to communicate with friends with out having to call them. Some of my friends don't have phones, so facebook is where I get to talk to them. Computers are useful for communication, but @CAPS4 for learning about local, national, and world @CAPS3. Going out to buy newspaper can be a. The cost of them can start to add up, and it @MONTH1 not always give people the information they want. Reading @CAPS3 online is so much simplier. It is extremly easy to go to a website that has @CAPS3 and find a topic you want to read about, @CAPS4, there are vidios and color pictures on a computer that there aren't in a newspaper. Looking at pictures is a great way to get more out of an article. If somebody is reading an article, but can't picture what happened in their heads, photos are helpfull. Vidios are a fun and easyway to learn @CAPS3. There is often more information in a vidio than there is in an article. Reading @CAPS3 on the computer is only one way computers benifit society. The games on computers can be fun and helpful. Experts say that a person who played a game on a computer once a day for a month increased their hand-eye coordination by @PERCENT2. Just imagine if somebody did that for an entire year! I admit, some games don't help people as much as others but the ones that do can be so helpfull. One game that helps a person think is called mind-sweeper. In this game people of all ages are challanged to find the mines hidden in an area. This helps people pay attention and think carefully about what they are clcking. Playing games on a computers can aid someone if they would like to have better hand eye coordination or reflexes. Computers benifit society because they are the number one way people communicate, they are convinient when it comes to reading @CAPS3, and games on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people."	2156	
2157	1	"My opinion about computers is that they help society stay up to date with their surroundings, Computers also allow us to stay in touch with family and friends and stay update with the local and global news. Its not the computers fault people wont go outside. Researchers claim ""computers are one of the main reasons for obesity and other health deffects."" I would like to know how is it the computers fault. It does not breath, I does not sleep, it doesn't eat. I has no organs. So how does the computer control the use? It doesn't. The people who sit at there computer all day cause there own problems by not getting up out of the chair and going outside or going to the gym. A computer is an in animate object therefor it cannot control the user. Even with a computer you can still interact with family and friends. Most people nowadays use emails to stay in touch. Emailing is now alot faster than regular mail. People also use only chats such as @CAPS1 or windows live. My favorite way to chat with friends and family is via skype. Skype is a video chat service that allows you to talk to anyone in the word at any given time or place. Computers do still allow you to interact with others. A some computer programs allow us do work easier. Programs like rosseta stone help learn languages. Search engines such as google, yahoo, or @CAPS2 helps us to find articles or pictures on certain subjects. They also allows us to find maps and get directions to places. Microsoft word, powerpoint, and excel helps us type up projects, create slide shows, and make spread sheets. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my class use these programs almost everyday to help with school and just for fun. Do you think we should use computers? Are they bad for us? Do you think they are benificial? In conclusion computers are very benificial to our everyday life. The allow us access to almost whatever we want to learn. Computers keep us in touch with family and friends in many different ways. I say leave the computers alone they are fine."	2157	
2158	1	"Nowadays, every generation is becoming more and more obese. I think that a major contributor to this is computers. When you use the computer a lot, you spend less time enjoying nature, lose exersising time, and isolate yourself from your family and friends. Do you want society to progress like this? While you use the computer, you isolate yourself completely from the outside world. A study from the phycology department of @CAPS1 says that people who are addicted to the internet or other computer games are often estranged from the ones they love. It is a fact that visiting with your family can greatly improve your relationship with them. You @MONTH1 think well, I can talk and visit with my friends virtually, but what about when your family goes out to the movies or your friends are at the park. Do you want to isolate yourself in cyberspace? As almost everybody knows our weight situation. In the @ORGANIZATION1 is rapidly detirorating. Every new generation become fatter and fatter, like a farm of pigs. I think this is because of advances in technology, like computers. Now, on the computer you can play baseball, @CAPS2, tennis lacross, soccer, and any variety of sports. Instead of getting outside and playing. Kids are sustituting play on the computer for actual exersise. Sometimes, a kid's exersises cutshort because of the based computer games running their schedule. The more time spent on a computer, the less time spent exersising, playing sports, or doing other various activities in the real world not the virtual one. Another common problem that most everybody knows about is our failng eco-system. The more time spent on a computer, the less outside enjoying nature. If you have your face studs to the moniter, you won't see all of the endangered species trying to survive and soon youll become different to the world. If we are going to save our world, we must get outside and work a lot the type of work you can do on a computer. I personally spend much more time outside, enjoying nature than my friends with their own computers. If a person can't see the cloud of a mog that hangs over and around cities, than how can they do anything to stop it? Now, I know that people in cities don't have much wildlife to enjoy, but we have not progressed to the where every tree every where a high-rise. Even from big cities like new york, it is only a short drive to nature, a short drive to truly living. Now think back. Do you want to be estranged? Do you want your children to be having heart attack age of ? Do you want to suffer directly from the ecosystem that will no longer  earst? If you do, then you should keep your face on the monitor, but I know that we can change starting with computers."	2158	
2159	1	"Dear local Newspaper, the effects that computers have on people are crazy. Everyone around the world uses a computer to find something to research. Some of the websites you can actually talk to your friends! When people found out that you were able to communicate with your frends they talked for hours. The computer can also help you buy things off of the internet. But most of all, the computer has a huge effect on peoples jobs. If you are a real a toy you need to find out information on the house so you will be able to sell it to the customer. Jobs are really important. You need information about things to help you with your job. It can really effect your life if you lose your job by not getting information off the computer. Communicating online is also very helpful. If you get really bored one day you can go online and talk to your friends to see if they want to hang out. I have a connection to when I was in my house on the @DATE1 and I was really bored. So I went online and invited a friend over my house. Weather is another main issue. If you were to get stuck inside your house on a very rainy day and you have nothing to do, you can play games online. When it snows you play outside then come in and get warmed up then go on the computer. I think that on my opinion overall that playing on the computer is really popular for people around the world. Some games you can translate words so you can learn new languages! So even at home on the computer you can get a lot smarter by learning new languages from other people."	2159	
2160	1	"Dear readers of the local newspaper, I agree that everyone is using computer nowadays, I think we should do something about it. One reason why I think computers are bad people is because you can't really trust the people in the computer. Another reason is computers are bad for your health, and lastly you don't spend time with your family if you're using the computer too much. First, you can't really trust people in the computer you meet them online and they can lie about everything and you won't even know this is bad if you're only @NUM1 and you're chatting with people you don't know. Yes, you want to make new friends over computer but who can you really trust these days? They can put up fake pictures and you won't want to fall into their trap. Second, I think computer are bad for yor health. They can burn your eyesight and can leave you blind @PERCENT1 of teenagerswho have used the computer for over @NUM2 hours now and need to get glasses because they can't see it. However, you can use the computer for an hour, it'll be fine, but if you use it more than @NUM3 to @NUM4 hours you @MONTH1 need to go to the doctors to check your eyesight. The brightness of the computer can also burn your. Lastly, you don't want the computer to affect you and your lifestyle. These are the three reasons why I think computers are bad for people. You can't trust anyone in the computer, it's bad for your health and thirdly it can affect your life. I hope that with this letter you might do something to help at those in need."	2160	
2161	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that they have a positive effect on people. The reasons why computers have a positive effect on people is because people learn new things, they can interact with their family and friends on a computer, and lastly because using moving the mouse on a computer is containing lots of muscles. One reason why computers have positive effects on people is because some people learn new facts everytime they go on the computer. It is very possible to learn new things on a computer everytime you go on a computer because computers contain lots of information. Learning new facts everytime you go on a computer is a good thing people always, say ""you learn something new everyday"". Everytime someone learns something new they are adding more information into their brain. When you add more ideas in your brain the more you know, and the more you know the smarter you are. Those are @CAPS1 reasons and details of why computers have positive effects on people. The second reason why computers have positive effects on people is because people can interact with their family and friends on a computer. Their are video cameras on laptops where you can view your family from out of the state and you can interact with them instead of traveling. When you use a video camera on a laptop you don't have to call. You do not have to go through so much with buying passports to see family and friends that are out of state when you can get in contact with them over a computer. That is another reason why computers have good effects on people. And lastly another reason why computers have good effects on people is because it takes lots of muscles to move the mouse all over the screen. When it contains muscles to do things it is considered exercizing to me because anything that a person does contains muscles. That is a good thing because exercising is good for you. So movements to a computer does contain exersize. That was the last reason of why computers have good effects on people. @CAPS1 position was stated wich was computers do have good effects on people. I also listed @NUM1 reasons why."	2161	
2162	1	"Computers are an object that have different opinions from different people. Some people think that @CAPS3 is a perfect use of time to go on the computer all day long, while some parents have time limits for their kids telling them how long they can go on the computer (and the x-box, or play station, @CAPS1, etc.) @CAPS2 that way, they won't have to sit there on a bright, sunny afternoon when they could go for a walk in the park. Companies use computers to make their time more useful to store what people bought, sold, with a click of a mouse and when they would need the information for a refund, click!, and there @CAPS3 pops up. The topic is @CAPS2 debateable that people could protest about @CAPS3. Here are some of the benefits from computers: @CAPS3 can have people save time by ordering online and delivering the item to their house, webcams can let people see others in the convience of their own homes, social networking sites and virtual worlds are another way for people to see each other, and more can be done in less time. Some people think that if you sit on the chair and use the computer all of the time, you might be tired, need a break, or just to go outside to get some fresh air. @CAPS3 can also make people obese and can cause them to die. My opinion is that computers are convient, but they should be used sparingly because they can cause problems in your social life, educational life, etc. I also think that people should use the computer for a purpose, and not spread viruses, worms, trojan horses, or anything like that. Computers have benefits like having time savers on @CAPS3 or can be a defect to your normal life. But, I think that computers are good. This concludes my essay."	2162	
2163	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that people should be able to spend as much time on a computer as they went. While they're on the computer they can tak with friends or do school assinments. People can also learn a lot of important facts as well. Being on the computer can keep kids out of trouble. And the computer can be very helpful to all. In this paragraph I'll tell you how being on the computer can be good for people. One way the computer can help is by printing out an important photo like of a family member or freind. Another way the computer can help is by having younger kids play educational games that help with spelling, math, or reading, A third way the computer can help is by letting us chat with friends that live far far away. Next, I'll tell you about how kids might need the computer for doing class asingments. It can print out an essay at last minutes notice. The computer can send the essay to a teachers email. Or maybe the'll need to quickly type something up for something else. The computer can also allow people to email their lapher! and tell them why they coudn't complete an asignment. Finally, I'll tell you about how the computer can keep kids out of troble and how it helps adults as well. Being on the computer can kids out of bad situations like peer presure, smoking, or doing something bad kids can ba safley at home instead. If kids are always at side playing and running around they could get hurt or break a bone, maybe even hurt someone else, The computer can help out adults as well because people can purchase items that they need. Another it can help is because business owners can check stocks or the. Some can compare the price of different stores. This concludes my letter on how computers can be helpful. Rember the the @LOCATION1 can help a bit. The kids out of trouble. Teach a lot of educational things. And do school assinments."	2163	
2164	1	"Evrey year inventors come up with new desings of computers. They always improve and atract customers from @NUM1 years old to a grown adults. Computers can be used for alot of needed things, but after the years people have taken advantage of them. Kids all over spend hours siting on the computer. These computers can be very dangerous to these young kids. Also @CAPS1 people just sit around for hours and dont exercise your body it can become very unhealthy. Also it takes peopel away for the more important things in life. For my first reason, I am stateing that it is very dangours for kids to have a opening to evreything there is in the world. Kids are talking to strangers whitch can result to a bad ending. There are so many syber avenders that just wait for a young kid to come around and talk to them. They end up coming them to do things that they shouldn't be doing. There have been so many crimes that have to do with kids and the internet. Kids spend way to much time on the open internet. Kids and adults spend hours on computers. Its ussaly for pointless things. They sit there when they could be outside excirsising or go to a gym. They could be doing somthing as thats good. For their health. Many kids and adults have been oveweight due to the lack of exercis. One of the main reasons why is because of them siting around on a computer for so many hours doing nothing. They get so focused on what they are doing on the computer they never have time to get up and exercis their bodys. My last reason that I think computers have been taken advantage of is because it takes time away for more imporant things. It takes away from things like Family, Friends, @CAPS2 work, and alot more. @CAPS1 people spend all this time on computers they will grow apart from family and friends. Also kids will not have time to do homwork and their grades will drop. Geting into colledges to start a life is way more important then doing pointless activities on the computer. Now you know all my reasons why I think computers have been taken advantage of adults and kids are taken away from the more important things in life. Also for kids very dangourus. Lastley people are beoming overweight due to spending time on computers. Thats why I think computers have been taken advantage"	2164

2166	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I know computers might seem helpful but in the hands of a teen, preteen or child they are not in thoose hands children become mindless zombies. They stay away from family don't sleep and you never know what there doing. First off, even though we have all this technology minors abuse @CAPS4. They could do realy nastey things ok. You never know, for all they know they probably talking to some @NUM1 year old pervert! Would you know? No! you would never find out until the end. @ORGANIZATION1 griffen stated ""@PERCENT1 of all child abductions start over the internet."" @CAPS2 listen alway check on your child or else he could be @NUM2 feet under dead and raped. (note never let cildren got'n @LOCATION1 they will be abducted) @CAPS3 reason is children become adicted to the computer they will never come to you. Listen I know a friend the only comes outside once a year because he stays at home playing a computer game! He was @CAPS2 adicted hand to tie him up to go outside @CAPS4 was truly awful how pale and barely he was I puked. @CAPS2 at least try grounding them from @CAPS4 or locking them away from @CAPS4. My third final reason is kids will just truly get hooked and will fall school. They will just cease living normaly they some how feed of of technology. @CAPS4's really glue some never let this happen everthis is your last warning. @CAPS2 nows the time to act don't let this happen curb your children now unless you wait a future of nothingness. Its time to act unless you wanting have your child get taken into that anarchy!"	2166	
2167	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly support advances in technology. I feel that computers have placed a positive effect on us. Imagine a mother sitting at home chatting with distant friends. Suddenly, her daily calendar pops up, reminding her to go to the gym for one hour today. If she didn't have this gentle reminder, she would probably forget to get her daily excersize in printout directions to the gym would be helpful as well how could she get this done?

2168	1	"Dear lacal newspaper, I wrote this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think it gives people the ability to talk to their family and friends from far away places. They get a chance to meet new people and hae fun with it. One reason is because you night have your family far away from you and you never get a chance to see them; so your best choice is the computer. I know that some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enjoying nature. But just think about it some people just like to be in the house and just have time for themselves @CAPS1 reason is because it helps your kids learn more about life and nature, it also helps them learn about faraway places, places they have never sint in life. Enjoying nature can be dangerous. more than @PERCENT1 of the people in this world get hurt exploring new things and places. You can't force somebody to leave the computer benine. If thats what they like being in their house and not trying new things well its up to them it's their life not yours. The third reasone is because there are social skills, leassons and activities kids can try out on a computer. Things they can't do in the real world. Adults have a chance to find friends from their high school years in facebook and get a chane to talk about how are they doing in life today. Remember that you @MONTH1 be concerned about the people spending more time in the computer but some bad things @MONTH1 be good things and good things @MONTH1 come out to be bad things."	2168	
2169	1	"Dear @CAPS1 I think computers do keep people from going outside and exercising. People have to much fun playing online, checking their email and listening to music on the web. When they should be out side having fun. Parents should spend time keeping their child outside they can sign them up to a sport, take them to the beach or to the park. As long as their child is not on the computer. Parents im sure you you want you children healthy so get them out side to exercise. Also keep your kid @CAPS2 if they are bored you can buy them a toy to play with outside, keeping them away from the computer. You can also take them on a bike or camping.

About @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 uses computers a day to do what they need to get done. What my point is that the people of @LOCATION1 can't live without computers. Major boltom as well agree with me. He even said,""that hewould be lost without his computer."" Computers just making things easier to do know a days. Today computers are used to do your homework online, buy things without leave your house, and help map quest places you want to go. In fact, studys show that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 says that computers make work a whole faster to do.

The @CAPS1 reason why I agree with this position is not interacting with family and friends I say this because, some of the people that use the computer get more adicted everyday they wont talk with people. Another issue is that the computers can get more enjoyable for the user's. For example, new games, web sites and even job applications. As you can see these sorts of things get very addicting to kids to adults. The second reason why I agreed to this position is exercising I think this because in ways the human body needs an amount of exercising each and everyday. In other words if a user sits on a chair all day and he or she always getsclose to the computers screen that can hurt your body without you even noticing. Another way use'rs should exercise is to motivates them selves to have some strenghth in their life. For example - if user's dond't get much exercise it can cause problems to their body like asthma, dihabites, or cancer and there are more. The third reason why I agree to this position is eating because user's get to concentrated on the computer they sametimes dono't get to eat as offen as they did before."	2173	
2174	1	"Dear newspaper, I believe that people spend too much time on the computer. Most people nowadays ""talk"" through e-mail, but instead, they should be face-to-face talking with each other. Also, being outside is much better for you, because your body needs things like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from the sun. Lastly, there could be bad things on the @CAPS3, like websites that could send viruses to your computer. As you can see, these are all the reasons why I believe that the computer can be dangerous. ""@CAPS4"" with people through the @CAPS3 is not healthy. First of all, it decreases people's ability to make conversations. Statistics clearly show that about @PERCENT1 of people who talk with other people over e-mail have trouble talking and making good conversations with other people in the real world. Second of all, when people talk through e-mail, they're basically having a conversation with their computer rather than with an actual person, and this is not healthy. Lastly, talking with people over email can be addictive, and you might lose track of time and end up staying on the computer for hours. During this time, you should be outside getting fresh air or running around! Being outside is very important. The sun gives your body @CAPS1 @CAPS2, which is a @CAPS1 needed in the process of digesting proteins. Also, being outside gives you fresh air. This is essential because your body needs natural, fresh air to stay healthy. Staying inside all day isn't good for you, because then you're just breathing in stuffy air. Finally, being outside gives you exercise. I know whenever I go out for a run, I feel great because getting vitamins, fresh air, and fantastic exercise. Lastly, people shouldn't go on the computer as much because there could be bad things on the @CAPS3. For example, in certain websites, there could be viruses that the website sends to your computer. I remember one time, our computer was completely locked up, so we couldn't go to the @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION1 word or any of our icons, so we had to get a professional to come to our house and fix our computer for us. Also, there could be inappropriate things on the @CAPS3 that young children shouldn't see. Lastly, there could be some websites that cause your computer to respond very slowly or freeze. This is why people shouldn't waste all their time on the computer! So I believe that people should go on the computer less frequently because ""@CAPS4"" with people through e-mail is not the healthy, being outside is much better for you, and the computer could have bad things.

2175	1	"Dear local Newspaper, Computers are becoming a problem with kids these days and how they are constantly on them kids abuse their privelouses of using their computers. They also usually have too much freedom with their computers using it whenever they want. Seven out of ten kids between the ages ten through sixteen spend at @TIME1 day on their computer. This is a problem that needs to stop so kids can exercise more and be active. sometimes the reason kids are on the computer so much is their parents don't care how long their kids are using electronics instead of getting freshair and enjoying the outdoors. One of my friends is on the computer as soon as he gets off the buss so he can look at things he wants to buy. These kids need to start being outside more. Kids are constantly abusing their privelauges on their computers. An example of this all too common problems when the childs @CAPS1 is at work they go on the computer when they are suppose to be doing something like homework orchores. The kids in this time are too attached to their electronics and the ""can't"" live without them. Most adults let their children use their computer or the family computer whenever they want to without being supervised. now I'm not saying that the child is going to be irresponsible with their freedom but don't you think that that is way too much freedom? with all the time the kids aren't doing homework or something that actually needed to be done on the computer the kids could be spending time with friends, playing sports, or some other fun outdoor activity. As you can see, kids in this day and age abuse their technology way too much. Whether it's how much time they spend on the computer, their privelauges on the computer, or even the freedom the kids have on the computer. The kids need to learn to be more active and healthy, this is why I am against the time kids are using their technology for leisure instead of something they need."	2175	
2176	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers don't hurt people, they help them. They have many benefits. People don't even spend all day on the computer, they help us learn new things, and they help doctors and scientists cure diseases. As you can see computers help the world. People do not spend all day on the computer. Lots of people spend most of the day outside swimming, playing games, and walking in the @DATE1 and @DATE2. Whenever I go to the beach, it's always packed! However, some people do spend all day on the computer but thats a small part of the population. Computers do benefit the world! If we didn't have computers, now would we talk with family members who live far away? Some people have family and friends who live in different places then they do. They use computers to talk with them. For example, my family and I would not be able to see my @CAPS1 as often as we would like to if we couldn't talk with her on the computer. In other words, I wouldn't be able to see my @CAPS1 if computers wern't around. Another reason computers benefit society is it teaches you things that you otherwise woudn't know! Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 it""? If we didn't have computers we woudn't be able to look up things or do projects at home. Computers have made people smarter! Computers help save lives. If doctors didn't have computers they might not be able to help cure people. What would happen if police didn't have computers? They woudn't be as organized and they might not be able to catch criminals. Police and doctors might nor be able to test @CAPS5 or fingerprints as accuratly. If scientists didn't have computers they might not be able to cure some diseases. What if someone got a disease that with computers scientists coud cure, but they coudn't because there wasnt any computers? In conclusion, computers help save lives, cure disease, and catch criminals. Computers help the world! First people don't even spend that much time on computers. Second, computers help teach people, and keep family and friends connected. Lastly, computers help doctors, police, and scientists. As you can see, the world is a much better place with computers."	2176	
2177	1	"I believe that computer have good effect on people. I think that because the computer has many different learning websites and game websites but the last but not least they have icons that you could click on an go to different pages one is word microsoft and other pages. I like all of the learning websites that help kid are ago in at home instead of only learning in school one of the learning website that. I live is @LOCATION1 because it has work for every grade and it has learning games. The games on computers are interesting they have a different society of game they have ball, shooting, snowbourding, football and mind games all of their games they have fun, cool, and enjoyable to play. One thing about the prompt is that if you a project of that needs to be type just click icons and write that you need to write you pictures and different types of designs to help it interesting. Now you heard my percision how do you the great qualities in computers like learning websites, game website and prompt websites."	2177	
2178	1	"Dear @CAPS1: @CAPS2't you use computers to edit your newspapers? Computers are used all the time all over the world. Computers are one of the most greatest invetions ever made. With computers, we are able to talk with far away friends and family, research and about things fast, and we can even buy plane tickets and book vacations. Just think about it; without computers, where would we be today? If you have friends or family far away, you probably know what a hassle it is to house phone cards in order to talk to them. They cost money and you have to enter lots of different numbers. With computers, you can talk to them free, online, and you @CAPS2't even have to call them. If something happens to a family member of yours, the fastest way for everyone to find out is to just send an e-mail to them and you @CAPS2't have to each person seporatly. Online, you can even re-connect with old friends, and catch up with each other. Not only can you talk to people, but you can also research on things and find out what is happening all around the world, almost instantly. On computers, you can research on all different topics, and even find out things for a school project. You can also find out the news, weather, and what is happening all over the world. If there is a school project and you need to research the topic, the most efficiant way is to use the computer. It has the most information and it is the fastest way to learn about that topic. Not only that, but you can even look up the weather reports for all over the world, news and what is happening allover. the computer is great for this, but you can also look vacations on it! Do you want to go on vacation, but @CAPS2't know how to learn about the different places you can go to first? On computers, you can book vacations, and even buy plane tickets. You can look on line for resorsts and hotels, and book a room in advance. You can even see all your different options for places you can stay. Not only that, but you can buy plane tickets. Without having to go through too much troubles, you can buy plane tickets; online! You can even just look at prices and times if you want too. And it's the fastest way! So, now that you have been informed about all the great things you can do on computers, like connect with far away friends, research things and buy plane tickets, @CAPS2't you think computers are the best?"	2178	
2179	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 all over the world use computers, but not everyone agress that this benefits the society. In my opinion, ever since computers came out, @CAPS2 need to spend quality time with there family. Computers have made a huge effect on people. Grown people have depended on there computer to find everything and the websites have come to there attention so they get attached to the computers. As for students, they also get attached to these websites such as myspace, youtube, facebook, etc. i think its good to use your computer once in a while instead of all the time. Some students end up getting jumped over online talking. Some grown ups just sit around all day interacting with people on the computer and don't interact with there kids. In my opinion, people should go outside more and hang out or go out with there kids. Why sit around all day on the computer and have online coversations with ramdom people when you can go outside and hang out with your friends. it has came to my attention that some paretnts avoid these kids and don't want to listen to what they have to say because there so into the computer. Children also like to start trounble with people online and then kids get hurt over something that was said. I would .like to see more people going out then staying home on a computer. People get fat and don't care. Some people are addicted to there computer and can't let it go. I hope that you agree with me and make change."	2179	
2180	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of doctors think that it is better to go outside then to sit inside and go on the computer? It's definatly better for you. I think that people are spending to much time on the computer and not enough time doing other things. They should be hanging out with family and friends, getting out of the house and not forgetting about important things. I hope you will listen to my reasons for this. My first reason is that when your on the computer, it's taking away time to spend with your friends or your family. When your on the computer and your so sucked in your not spending enough time with your friends or family. Instead of comming home from school and going onto the computer, make plans with your friends and go do something. Instead of going on the computer, make plans to do something with your family, like go out for ice-cream or something. Just don't go on the computer. You do nothing when your on the computer, which @MONTH1 have a result of falling asleep or getting yelled at to get off. Another reason I have is that when your on the computer, time flys by so fast, you don't even realize it. Then, you loose track of time. Sometimes, people get so sucked in, that they forget that they have homework or need to study for a test. It @MONTH1 be important to do your homework before you get sucked in, then you want have to about doing it after you loose track of time. Some parents @MONTH1 even get sucked info, and that might be bad to because who's going to make you dinner? My last and final reason is that you need to get out! If you sit, in a chair, in a stuffy room, stairing at a screen, that's just not good. Just picture it, it dosn't look very good. Getting out is a really good thing to do in your life. It's a big part of it. It's one thing that keeps you nice and healthy. When you get out you are doing things that make you happy. Like, hanging out with friends or doing fun things with your family. Sitting inside on a beautiful day, dosn't that make you sad? Wouldn't you want to go outside instead of sitting and playing around on the computer? These were some of the reason why I think that people are spending to much time on the computer. Doing this can cause some seriuos problems like not spending time with family and friends, forgetting about major things, and not getting out enough. These are major issues. I definately think that people are spending way to much time on the computer. Thanks for listening."	2180	
2181	1	"Dont you think computers are not a waste of time? Well I mean if you think about it, computers have a very large effect on people. For example, kids and teenagers spend more time on the @CAPS1 thatn doing their homework. Also teens stay uplate at night and chat with their friends or people don't even know! Lasly, computers are not healthy because teens would rather sit in front of a computer than exercising. Well, as we all and most on their thime on the @CAPS1 doing their. For example, kids would go on the computer and tell there parents they don't, do. and kids also on the @CAPS1 watching think what could be spending more time doing their homework. Lastly, most teens and big test that they need to study for. But, what they would rather do is on the @CAPS1. Teenagers just love to their don't on school days we all know teenagers and watch televison and the. If you think about it, late wake up and early the next day. Also, most teens chat with thier friends online. For example, because planty not tot the where their time. Lastly, I must that computers are for teens at all! Many should agree! This is because teenagers used to sit in front of a computer. Rather than ! We also know that a lot of teens @CAPS2. You @CAPS2 sports you hsould spend times on the computer and practice on getting ! Computers are their taking time out from the fresh air and being with your friends at the or even time mall! Yup ! S you I think all agrees. Next computers in a have on teens and. Thier are many "	2181	
2182	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I agree that spend more time on a computer than work outor do other things like cleaning his/her home or room. Anther reson is if you are on a computer talk to someone you mite not know who they are or how old they mite be be. @CAPS2 last reson why is more people needs to excercis then its on a computer all day @CAPS2 first reson was he or she how to clean there room or house because if you stay on a computer you will never time to clean you meat someone online and if they come over they mite not want to stay with you because your to clean and @CAPS2 last reson is if you dont have a clean house you can find games or for the computer. @CAPS2 reson was you mite know what are they are who they are because if you ask these because you are talking to online to come over they mite be a killer or a rapist. Plus if you talk to that person everyday you or they mite be come with each other. If you mite be driven crazy for that person and crazy stuff. @CAPS2 last reson for this message is to excercis because if you are on a computer all day you will never have to exercis. Or if you yoo can't be active like playing baseball. So when you do get off ther computer and go play baseball you will be slow or not even want to play at all. Iam in conclusion computers are good to have but not the last thing to do all day because you will not be able to clean your house, you mite talk to all killer or not be to work out and be fit @CAPS3 you for reading."	2182	
2183	1	"Dear newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They have a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 gives them important information. Also that they can talk to family members or friends. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is really fun and @CAPS1 is a good exercise for their fingers. First of all, the computer gives them important information, @CAPS1 helps them learn about the history of different places that they didn't know about. Also that if kids needed help on their homework they could use the computer to help them. Another thing is that @CAPS1 help people learn about the news and what is happining. Second of all, the computer allows them to talk to family members and friends. They could send pictures to there friends or family members. Another thing that they can do is see each other online. Also @CAPS1 is good way to keep in touch with there family members. Last but not least, the computer is really fun and at the same time a helpful exercise. They could play lots of games such as racing, baseball and many others online. Also that they could put there pictures online. @CAPS1 is also a good exercise because when they type they use the fingers which is a good exercise. In conclusion, computers are a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 gives them important information, they can talk to family members and friends, and its fun and great exercise at the same time. Please think about my opinion before you make the decision."	2183	
2184	1	"Dear @CAPS1 - @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think the internet is useful and beneficial to the community? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that @LOCATION1 civilians disagree. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that their thoughts are ludacris. The internet allows people to interact with distant friends and family members. The world wide web also helps people relax and is convenient. First of all, the internet allows people to interact with distant friends and family members. Not to long ago, my mother and i joined www.@CAPS4.com. Since our friends and family never pick up the phone, we thought chatting on the internet might be a good idea. When we both signed up, we found out that our entire family is on @CAPS4 and they are glued to it almost all day! Now, instead of having voicemail messages and not talking, we can talk to (or type to) them anytime & place! Secondly, the internet helps people relax. You could hop on the computer and play a game that pulls you into another demension and forget about the stress you endured that day. In recent studies, @PERCENT1 of participants agreed that their body and mind felt renewed and replenished. My mother and father even agree! Combined, my parents work almost twenty hours a day and the computer helps them their troubles. Thirdly, the computer is very convenient. Before people by stop and shop was invented, my family would hate shopping. Now, supermarkets are taking this idea and its become enjoyable to shop. Also, some older folk and handicapped people @MONTH1 not be able to go shopping or out at all. Thanks to the internet and their amazing ideas, life is much easier for them! Computers and the internet are two fabulous inventions. They make it easier to communicate with friends and family, relax, and make things more convenient. If not for the internet, life would be rough harder than it is. Please take my opinion seriously and agree with portion of the population that is for computer usage!"	2184	
2185	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers are a waste because nobody likes to go out & exercise anymore for example instead of going outside & playing baseball they stay inside, turn on the computer & play baseball on the internet instead of going out & getting some fresh air. Another example why computers are bad is when you chat online you sometimes dont know who you are talking too. That is how people are getting kidnapped now because they're trusting these online. When people their pictures online they dont know who is looking at them. The internet is a great thing but everything good always comes to a end. The internet is a part of our society but every now & then we have to cut it off cause one know People today think that computers are ways to meet new people & learn new things so dont you read a book or go outside & explore but that is just my opinion I hope you agree to."	2185	
2186	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Time I strongly beleave that computers can only help us and can do no wrong. As we all know by now the world around us is changing and changing for the better I think computer are basically the key to the online world with it anything can be done. The computer can help you comunicate with family and freinds from all over the world, it is a faster and easier way to learn and it computers are helping business get to consumers. Family is one of the most important thing to me and I think it is for most people to. Families offen dont live in the same town state or even country as each other. For example my family is from @LOCATION3 and @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 but one of my uncles live in @LOCATION2 a @NUM1 hour drive from were I live. So as yo can imagine we dont see each other often @MONTH1 be twice a year. So for siblings who have grown of with each other that is no ebough so many of my uncles communicat through @CAPS3. Computers are also a key to education, so why not unlock the door. When soemone has acsese to computers at tjeir home it is live a cortable library. Also it makes things much easiers to do such as going to dictionary, con instead of looking up a word. Their will also be a end to that question I didind understand the homework the internet can provide you with the answers you need. Consider computers and education a advancement in our system of learning. Computers also help buisnesses. Buissnesses have always been triang to get to his consumer. Throug comercials, sighns even walking up to your door and telling you what to buy now computers have a new world of consumers. What well known buisness do you know of that dont have there own website @CAPS1 publick schools even have thers own site, so everyone is steping up. So in conclusion you see that compers are a key to the world after reading this I hope you share my point of view. Computers are help learn communicate and share your ideas."	2186

In @DATE2 The average @CAPS10 was not @CAPS9. But today however More than @PERCENT3 of @CAPS10 are overweight or @CAPS9, @CAPS11 no, schools do not have a positive effect on @CAPS8 because they cause a @CAPS15 of exercise less time enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. The average @CAPS10 between the ages of @NUM1 get less than @CAPS12 hour of exersise a day.

2188	1	"Dear Newspaper, I belive that computers have a positive, effect on people. The are a great way to save time as technology continues advancing. Also, they make people happier. they can even help you to expand your knowledge on any given subject. Clearly, computers have a positive effect on people, and help people every day. The first reason why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is because using them is a great way to save time. Paying taxes used to be a very time consuming thing that people have to do every year. But, now that computers exist to help people pay taxes easily, it takes a lot less time to do so. In fact, it has been proven that people, who use computers to pay their taxes spend only @PERCENT1 of the time that people who don't have computers spend on doing their taxes. Also, computers can help you save time when you type. Whenover you write a document for school or for a job, typing is a much. It has been proven that people who type their papers instend of than finish must. As you effect on people computers have positive effect on people use them make people happier. Computers are very advanced technology and include fun games to play and endless amounts of websites. With computers, you have to many opportunities. You can create your own website by just the click of a button or became an alien in space in your favorite online game. You can even catch up on a television show you might have missed the night before and watch it with no commercials. It is also a know fact that @PERCENT2 of people who own computers are generally more happy than people who do not own computers. Therefore, computers have a positive, effect on people is because they can help you to expand your knowledge. Any fact that you @MONTH1 want to know about anything from ancient @CAPS1 to which athletes are cometing in the next @DATE1 olympics can be found on computer. If you wanted to, you could learn an entire language just from your computer. In fact, @PERSON1, the owner of a very popular computer campany called @ORGANIZATION1 once said:""Computers are a gatewawy to knowledge."" I believe that this statement is true. Also studies show that @PERCENT3 of the average person's knowledge comes from things they learned from a computer. So, computers have a positive effect on people. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because they are a great way to save time, they make people happier, and they can help to expand your knowledge on any given subject. Clearly, computers are a huge advantage in life and would be hard to live without. I hope that the editor of your newspaper appriciates my ideas and hopefully agrees with them as well. Thank You!"	2188	
2189	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They have a lot of information give @CAPS2 quicker and increase peoples social ability. Although most people I know are always on the computer I do not believe it's a waste of time. Having a computer is good when you need to do research or write a paper because it allows you to type your ideas if you have messy handwriting. It also provides a lot of information that's right at home instead of having to go to the library and check out multiple books. computers are a good information sources that help you learn about all different kinds of topics. Computers can do all sorts of things like telling you about up-coming events and the latest @CAPS2. At home I know I can never find the right @CAPS2 channel so i just look it yp on the internet. Its also really easy, you just type in what you want to look for in a search engine like @CAPS1 and it will bring you to a group of websites on your topic. Computers quickly change the information as soon as it comes out, making t fresh @CAPS2. I also think that computers benefit the younger age because it allows them to meet new people and stay in touch with family and friends. Websites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 are good I think in moderation. The internet can be a very dangerous place but can also allow silent communication between friends. All my friends are on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all the time we can talk to each other all at once, while sharing pictures and videos. It really keeps us occupied and allows us to spend time with people even if they're not really there. In conclusion, I think the computer is a great benefit to everyone by giving us information quick @CAPS2, and by allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family. The computer has modernized so much and will continue to help people out. even if that means spending some time inside or even an hour or so. Over all I think computers are great to have."	2189	
2190	1	"Dear local Newspaper, The other day I was reading one of your newspaper and I saw the area were you wrote about people not like to use the computer. Well I agree a little because people have to learn how to tip like me I use the computer and I tip really fast, my mom, dad and two brothers use the computer as well. People use the computer for a lot of things like doing homework or playing game or if they have free time just to look up stuff to learn about. Most people use it to make a liveing. They use it to make there on bissness at home. An yes I agree about what people think about computers like its not a bad thing if you dont like computers, I think its a good ideas for people not to use computers cause it can save a lot of money you can have over @NUM1 by not using computers. People get off your computer go out side play soccer, football do somthing. An dont just stay on the computer if your @NUM2 get a job make money. Hang out withe friends some of you are computer geeks and play some dragon games when you can be out side find new friends, you should only have @NUM3 hours to play on the computer like really do somthing with your life.

2191	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I think that the computers are bad. @CAPS8 one reason you get not a lot of exersise, two now they have vurtal planting of flowers and other plantes and tree's when you should be planting a real garden. My thrid a final idea is when you are online you are being lazy. Not a lot of exersise because you can play solitar on the computer when it is so you can go swimming or ride a bike or even go play tag with your friends and or your family. @CAPS8 example lets say you have the choice of a new computer and use it @CAPS8 the day or go to the park and run. chase your little brother or sister and or your cusions even, wich one would you chose? @CAPS1 is this virtual planting? I was talking to my aunt and she was watching this five year old and she asked ""@CAPS1 are you doing?"" The five year old was on @CAPS2 on @CAPS3 on her mothers accont. Now when I heard that I said to myself ""This new technology is taking everything to virutral."" I think that if you want to go plant virtural flowers you should go outside and plant some roses, or even a apple tree. When I look outside I do not see as much flowers as when I was younger. Now are you going to plant virtural flowers or reel flowers? When you are online and looking to see @CAPS1 @CAPS5 has, you are bring a lazy person. You want get us take your family or even your friends and say ""@CAPS4 do you want to go to @CAPS5 with me?"" @CAPS6 @CAPS1 you do is sit on your butox and go online. To tell you the truth I do it but when I am done I go to the store to see the clothes and to try them on.I hate it when people say ""@CAPS7 I cant I am online shopping."" @CAPS8 one you are taking someones job away by the virtual register that could be someone lossing their job. In this ecomincy that could be very hard on a person @CAPS6 job @CAPS6 money if they own a house they have to pay the bills and morage so if they do not have the money they just lost these house. Just because you want to go online shopping maybe because it is easier, but still think next time @CAPS1 if you were that person? How would you feel? So now you know my side of this story. @CAPS1 is your side the lazy, virtural planting and online person or the one who will get up and go outside and just go do it?"	2191	
2192	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers help people in many ways such as: helping scientist to gain information that will help mankind live a long life by finding cures for illnesses, allowing people to interact with other people all around the world and help ordinary people like you and I learn new things everyday. Do computers have a positive effect on people? I think they do because they help ordinary everyday people like you and I learn new things every day. If we didn't have computers getting information to every one across the world take a long time, if you mailed it it would take about one to two days if they are in the same country as you, and there is no possible way you could call everyone in the world to tell them you be on the phone for weeks maybe months at a time. Further more computers help scientists find cures and other ways to help mankind live long and prosper. If scientists didn't have computers people would be dying left and right because they didn't have the proper medication or medical attention, we wouldn't have half things we have @DATE1 if we didn't have computers. In conclusion computers make life much easier and getting information people around the the world quicker and more efficient. Without computers in todays society our lives would be much harder than what they already are."	2192	
2193	1	"Dear local newspaper, I understand that there is an important debate between the people who support computers and people who believe that too much time is being spent on the internet. I can insure you that the internet is affecting peoples physical health, distracting students from their schoolwork, and causing less time to be spent with family and friends. People are spending too much time on computers and it is affecting their physical health. Studies have shown that the average child spends three to four hours on the computer. This is causing people to lack exercise. For example, my friend @PERSON1 is always on @CAPS1 and playing his computer games. He started this trend last year. Since then, he has gained fourty pounds. He now weights @NUM1 lbs and is @NUM2 lbs overweight. It doesn't surprise me because a recent has shown that the leading cause of childhood obesity is children spending too much time on the computer. Do you want america to stay obeise? Computers are distracting students from completing their schoolwork. My friend @PERSON2, a freshman at @ORGANIZATION1, is a victim of distraction by computer. He enjoys @CAPS1 very much, but is on it all the time. This has distracted him from completing and turning in his science homework. Soon, his @NUM3 or @CAPS3+ average dropped drastically to a @NUM4 or @CAPS4-. Soon after, he decided he'@CAPS6 rather go on @CAPS1 then study for tests and quizes. His final grade for the trimester was soon a @NUM5 or a @CAPS6. Do you want to end up like @PERSON2 and receive a horifically low grade in a class that you are very capable of passing? Well studies has became more technologically advanced, our students average grades have been slowly decreasing. Unless we want this trend to continue, we must limit the time our students spend on the computer. Computers are causing children to lose quality time to spend with family and friends. Children need to spend time with their families. They are the people who support children through hard times and comfort them when they are sad. I have a very close relationship with my parents. They are always there for me whenever I reed them. This allows me to maintain my mental health. For example, when I was six, there was a child named @PERSON3 who would always bully me. Whenever I took mental abuse from him, my parents were always there to comfort me. What I am getting at is that children need a healthy relationship with their parents to maintain peace of mind. Although, if children are always on computers, they are not able to build a healthy relationship with their family. The same goes for friends. They are people you can always talk to, but if you are always on the computing then they cannot be there for you. If children do not stop using computers so frequently they will be risking there mental health. Do you want america to remain the most obeise country in the world? Do you want our children's academic performance to plumet? Do you want students to miss out on quality time with their friends and family? Then we must limit the amount of time people spend on computers before its effects on america are too drastic."	2193	
2194	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 have been many discussions floating around about the new technology of out society. Most of them, about computors. Some people say it is making our society more connected. Sure, I agree with that statement, but @CAPS1 are serious negative effects on; humanbeings with these computrrs. Addiction is found to be rising everywhere, along with danger with the internet brings. Many people have even lost their health to it! The list goes on and on. So do you think computors are really worth it? First of all, youth andeven adults become addicted to it. The new things such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3 twitter. Once people start up with these things, they can'r stop! Imagine; your mom finally let's you get a @CAPS2. You're so excited, you stated let's say @NUM1.m. you're so into it you ook up at the clock and it says one o'clock in the morning! You've been on for six hours! How did the time fly? Your getting addicted. You realize you're starting to do that every day. Your grades are failing, you haven't done any homework for the past month, and flunked all your tests. You see what computors can do to people? Time to dig a little bit deeper. Then, more trouble comes. Many teens and even some adults have died because of their computor! They go on to a communication website and meet unknown people. They can lie about their age, life and everything. sooner or later they willingly give their mystery person their name and address. Not a terrific idea. Before they know it, a killer could be knocking at their door. I would say @PERCENT1 of people who give strangers their address get into alot of deep trouble. People have died, been assaulted or have been mentally injured. It's not fun being cornered like that. Too many people have gone through this. No more pain should go around. Last but not least, people suffer from loss of health because of it. People never get to go outside or exsersize. All they do is sit infront of their computors and play games and send emails. People can also suffer from obecety. They never do anything but eat and play with their computor. Is that really a life to live? Doing nothing your whole life? Maybe losing all you energy over time, so all you can do is sleep? You could probably die young because of that. Get active and get exersize. I'm no saying ""@CAPS5 ever get on your computor again!"" I'm saying, don't sit like a cuch potatoe! Do you see all the problems computors can cause people to have? They're terrible! loss of health, addiction and even pain and death. Get people to stop spending time on their computor so much. Even just writing about it in the paper can really encourage people! Help stop the addiction; stop the pain!"	2194	
2195	1	"@CAPS2 I think of a computer I think of a piece of high tech technology with trillions of websites on every subject. But, just because these are made for a good reason doesn't mean the effort they have on people is go. Most people who have computers are "helpful" and @CAPS1 example of "@NUM1" century technology" but are they right? My main question here is are them computer and are these computers for good as the look? Being a teenager I know and a computers can do chatting online, listening to music, watching t.v. shows are all great examples of what sucks you into the internet universe. I spoke to local citizen @PERSON1, @NUM2, and asked her point of view on computers. She says,"@CAPS2 I was a child we never had any technology just sticks and stone. We never had to worry about not getting enough exercise because all we would do is pay outside,"kids today just sit in front of the computer, staring into a screen and moving mouse. That is not my idea of exercise. With computers comes higher obsesity rates. Getting off the computer and playing outside for just @CAPS1 house a day will change your life. Picture this a nice hot @DATE1 day you look outside and see the sun is shining in the sky and theres not a cloud in sight. The sound of birds chirping and bers roaming through your head. And what are you doing? Instead of being out these and enjoying your loosing up pictures of it. Why would you watch a frozen picture @CAPS2 you could watch mother nature in action right before you eyes? Instead of looking at pictures people why dont you take you take some yourself? It's beautiful out there so why don't you experience ot for youself and not have someone else do it for you. Being with my family and friends the most important thing in my life. Some @MONTH1 argue and you can talk to your friend and family on the computer you. Isn't the computer depriving you of something though? For example if a family member is sick with cancer wouldn't you rather be with them every moment you can instead of spending sometime instant messaging them on the computer. Theres one thing the computer can't let you do and thats how much you core someone. As you can see computer hour the pro's and there con's but initially I think the con's win. There so much a computer can do but one thing it cant do is make your desicions. So, are computers as good as they look? that is for you to decide. "	2195	
2196	1	"Do you really to take away all the help the compoter is it helps the elderly by being able to go to stop and show well watching @CAPS1, or let teens go to school well having breakfast, or even let a man plan his honeymoon well playing poker with his ""boys"". With the computer people who are boise dont always have time to do that stuff and with a click of a mouse they have it. just think about old or cripted people. It @MONTH1 be very hard to go shopping for their own asentionals like food or close. But with the computer they could in last minutes. Without having to leave the room. And in past years I, myself have bought food from stop and shop online it's quite and efective. All from the comfort of your home. Well if you like being comfertable and work to go to school there's another reason you need a computer are being off do online so you could be in you feety pajamas and go to class, because you dont have to leave your room. Or you could use your computer your a lucky man and are gotting marribe you can easily buy your tickets for the plan online and get reservation in @LOCATION1 with just a few clicks and some looking around."	2196	
2197	1	"Dear reader, @CAPS1 you know that the obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 has grown @PERCENT1 since technology became more advanced? Some say that computers are harmless and have a positive effect on people, where as others say that they have a negative effect on us I for one believe that computers do not benefit anyone. They prevent family time, distract people from other activities, and cause people to get less exercise. To begin, with computers around, families just don't have the same connection they used to. Computers have a large role in most peoples lives, and if there are people in your way of one, such as family members, then a fight breaks out, useally between sbilings. Computers always leave marks on families because not only do they cause fights, but they are unreliable. Information and important papers can get lost easily on a computer and cause you to miss out on the fun things trying to find it. One time I typed an essay on my computer, I saved it, I closed it, and went on my day. The next day I go to print it not its gone I had to type the whole thing again! As you can tell, computers just cause problems and prevent families from having fun. In addition, a computer just prevents people from doing other activities. I have been on the computer inumerable times. When I was supposed to be feeding the animals, cleaning my room paracticing my flute, and each time I end up regreting it. Also, I know many kids that would rather play on the computer thatn go outside and play be cause it is ""too hot"". If kids find any little flow, they will make it an excuse to just play on the computer. Computers are just preventing people from enjoying other activities. To conclude my reasons, computers are just plain unhealthy. If you think about it, computers are like cigarettes, unhealthy and addicting. The prevent people from exercising and staying healthy. @CAPS1 you know that almost @PERCENT2 of the growing obesity in @LOCATION2 is due to playing on the computer? Most people sit home all day, on their computers, only lifting a finger to type or click the mouse. This can be dangerous to people it can cause blood dots and heart attacks. @PERCENT3 of deaths per day are due to obesity. If you can't tell, computers can be hazerdous to people's health. To sum things up, computers are no good to the human race. The cause fights within families, less participation in activities, and contribut to the most dangerous thing, obesity. Computers just make life worse for you and me in the long run. Think, would you rather become overweight and play on the computer liek the people who think it is good for you, or would you rather join me and the others who are healthy?"	2197	
2198	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because I play on computers all day. One reason is because i now have awesome hand-eye cordination. For example on my computer if im about to die in a game, I just grab the keyboard and dont look. If that that doesnt make sense than me and my friends playgames with food where you put a cheese - it on the table and whoever grabs it. And i always get it. Another reason is that I can talk to my frinds online. This is good because then i don't have to make the phone bill more expensive. Also, I can help them with their homework online without having to be next to them. And the last reason I have to share is you can get maps online so you know how to get to places you dont know. That can help everyone because its a lot easier to get a map with directions then trying to decode an atlas or a map of the state. I know that you can also get pictures of school projects too. That is helpful because it will help you grade go up. These are the reasons that I think you should consider looking at before you say that computers are a waste of time and people spend too much time on them."	2198	
2199	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are in many ways a positive affect on people. They help people stay connected with friends and family, they allow people to see the news and weather at any point of the day, and they give people easy access to information need to be reasearched. This is why I think computers are positive. Phones help people stay connected through voice, but computers help people actually see and hear each other. @PERCENT1 of people use a progarm called skype which allows them to video chat with friends and family. Sometimes familys don'@CAPS1 own a webcam so instead the can use email to stay connected. You can send pictures through email and chat or just send someone a message to tell them your doing fine and ask how they are doing. Seven out of ten homes have parents leaving earlier than @NUM1. This means that they either dont have enough time to watch the news and weather or they dont want to disturb the other sleeping family members with the @CAPS1.V on. So instead of watching the @ORGANIZATION1 they can go on the computer and see the weather forecast and news. They can also see if there were any car crashes or other problems on the route they would take to work. This also helps when familys are going on trips. They can look at the weather forecast and decide what they need to bring with them. Almost @PERCENT2 of students use the @CAPS2 to do reasearch. They find information needed to do homework and projects. Most of the time school books do not have enough of the information. Needed to do assignments. Therefore, the computer is an excellent source to get more. Also, using @CAPS2 information helps kids be creative using different information than a text book offers also shows diversity in assignments. When students have different information not only does that one student learn but if they present it to the class the whole class learns something new. That is why I think computers are positively effective. They help familys and friends stay connected, they show people news and weather forecasts and they also help students get reasearch for homework assignments. I hope you greatly consider why I think they are a positive affect on people."	2199	
2200	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION3 has possesion of a computer, says @ORGANIZATION1. Intelligent people know that you need a computer. How could someone run a buisness without a computer, for example when they need to type or create an important logo online. Some people news are all from the interent, I'm sure of people wouldn't of heard about @ORGANIZATION4's earthquake without it. Another example is a lot of people can only communicate through email, or facebook, aim, etc. Maybe when someones out in @LOCATION4, they can't call so they email. Computers should not be banned! It's absolutley rediculous that someone would come up with such a horific idea. I mean a journalist like you should know this is a horrible ideal. How would you be able to finalize your papers to the news paper without a machine to type on? Are you going to hand write it on to the paper? Or how is someone's job to be a book keeper and hand write people's money, how's there job going to turn out? @PERSON1 a @NUM1 year old mom that has one child and a housband in @LOCATION4 hardly have a chance to communicate. Though when they do it's through email. That's it if she didn't have his email she'd never be able to know how he's doing if he's alright, and same with him. How could you possibly ban this. By banning computers you can make these people's lives more depressing and horrible then it already is know @CAPS1 away the internet from people can do extrem damage to buisnesses. Some buisnesses get all these ads from the internet. Sites like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3. What do you think will happen to the owners of those sights. Just we find after all the work they put into those sites. About @PERCENT2 of people buy almost half of there item that they give for gifts or clothes right from the inetrrent. So how could you take this away from them? This no computer ban is a bunch of bolonga! So what are you waiting for @CAPS2? Say no to this ban immidiatly. We most certainly should have computers! Intelligent people know that this idea is whacko. I hope you understand what I'm saying from this piece and make the right decision."	2200	
2201	1	"Dear, @LOCATION1 hour I am writing to you @DATE1 because I heard that people are writing to you about what they think aboute the effects computers have on people. I understand that computer can have positive and negative effects on people. I think computers have a negative effect on people. I think this because our generation spends way to much time in front of screens. Sure it @MONTH1 in prove hand eye coordination but it also give people an excuse to be lazy, and not get enough excersise which everyone needs. My secong reason is danger because there are all sorts of websites were kids can talk to strangers, they will never know who the person really is. For all they know it could be someone who wants to kidnap you because you believe they are someone they say they are. Sure they seem like a good person no one is really who they say they are and parents can't control what there kids do on there computers. My last reason is some kids might put inapropriete pictures on the internet, they think they can always delete them. But once some think is on the internet it never goes away. So you @MONTH1 think the computers help people, I beg to differ it's an excuse for people to be lazy and get no excersize. So in conclusion please take the time to think about what I have said and agree with me."	2201	
2202	1	"Dear The @CAPS1, Technology is the most advance thing in these days such as computers. People who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, which I think its true. They give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with other poeple, and teachs hand-eye coordination. In my opinion, I believe that computers have an good effect on people. Many people would agree and think the same. How would people learn information about people and other places? The computer would help you out alot because it teaches you alot of information about places and people. Thats one reason why computer have on effect on people because they find out a whole lot of information, rather than going to a library and reading books. Also, too find out info. its not going to be that hard. For example the website that will help is @CAPS2.com. Its shows a lot of info about a person a places. Another reason why the computer has a positive effect on people is because it could allow people to talk online with other people. of course people would like to communicate with others online, cause it is better. Its better because you could do great things online such as, make an avatar, if you have myspace create a page and more. People chatting online would intrest other people to go online and start chatting. Computers teach hand-eye coordination which is very helpful in the world. It causes an positive effect on people who works with them and people who works like in offices and other places. Having Hand-eye coordination would help you with your typing and also will give the effects companys have on . Everyone who computer has a little hand-eye coordination. Well wouldn't you think computers has an positive effect on people. It does because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with, other people, and teachs hand-eye coordination. I truly believe that computers benefits society in many ways. Also it has an affect on people. So wouldn't you agree with me and other people who thinks computers has a effect on people."	2202	
2203	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my concern that people are dissag reeing on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. Well, my opinion is that computers are very useful for people. @CAPS1 gives us a chance to socialize, learn about places, and even have online colleges tutoring! Please let me explain my ideas @CAPS2 you have friends that don't live close to you? Well, @CAPS3 so online chats like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 chatting can help you reconnect with you friends. You friends don't even have to live faraway to chat with online. @CAPS1 could be a friend from schol that you want to have a discussion with. Online chatting is as great opportunity for people who want to make friends. Imagine, your a at home mom trying to take care of you family. There's no time for an education unline schools can save this problem you can earn a degree online and have to worry about having to go to school everyday. Don't have the money for education? no problems thats is for get unline tutoring are likely to get there great up by isnt @CAPS1 amazing? and, its free! There are so many places in the world with history history book. All you have to @CAPS2 is go on a search engine type in any faraway place and boom! thousands of facts in just the click of a mouse. @CAPS1's amazing isn't @CAPS1 why search through a history book for hours when all you really need to @CAPS2 is type in anthing on google and get instant knowledge. Faster and easier @CAPS1 is. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people in various ways. I hope my opinion have helped you realize that computers only benefit people."	2203

Besides your family your friends and you outside family we the more important people in your life. with out them its a really lonley life for you.

2205	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has lately been of controversy as to whether computers are benign of malovelent. I strongly support the position that computers are sabotaging our experience on @LOCATION2. First with computers around we never get enough exercise to with our @CAPS2. Furthermore, nature might never be enjoyed as much as @CAPS1 should be while computers still infest humans with their pestilance. Finally, with computers disease of distraction being encouraged among students, we will never be able to reach our academic potential. The only place where computers belong is the junu yard. In our new era of computers, exercising is slipping away slowly live the in an hour glass. @CAPS1 is an ominous fact that ever since the flood of computers throughout @LOCATION1 our childhood obesity rate has each year. I can still remember the good old days in second grade when I had friends over and the first thing we would do was around our neighborhood, but now a-days the only thing they seem interested in is playing videogames on the computer. Computers not only affect what we do while with friends, but also while we are alone. If someone is home alone and in one room is a set of weights and in the other rom is a computer, statistics show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers would choose to go to the computer. Can't you see how computers are like the devil on our shoulder? Nature was meant to be experienced in person. Not from glance out the window while on the loading screen of a computer. Mostly once quoted that ""Computers are at the human love of nature and eventually there will be nothings left to collode. ""I have observed that every year that there are less and less people making their dog in. Is there really any other excuse for this other than the or computers. While computers are harmful in many ways, the leader or these are how they away at one academic potential. I understand tha the internet has many sources of useful information, but through a thorough survey of @PERSON1, I have found out that less than @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer as a source of information. If computers continue to vacate time that should be used for studying, than @LOCATION1's @ORGANIZATION2 will steadily descend down a path of darkness, and our future generations. In a study of @NUM3 students who studied and @NUM3 students who played on the computer, all or the students who studied scored higher than those who played on the computer, even though they studied math while the test was on science. Computers will continue to be the of our lives unless we put a wall in its path immediately."	2205	
2206	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know studies show @PERCENT1 of population doesn't get enough exercise? Also, that same @PERCENT1 wastes most of their time and money? The colprate for this are computers. Computers are a complete waste, not only are they unnecesary costs, they give out too much information. The even prevent users from getting exercise by doing something useful. I firmly believe computers have a bad and terrible effect on people. Computers are allways asking and giving out too much information. They ask for names, ages, and even street adresses. Believe it or not, most people will even give the computers this information. By doing this it is very unsafe and something you wouldn't want a computer to have. Out of all the deaths in our coutry, @PERCENT2on them are from murderers stalking computer users and hunting them down. This is not something I would want to happen to me or close friends. Als, people can easily lie. @NUM1 year old men can lie and say they are @NUM2 year old girls. They could trick you into being their friend this way too. So, why bother with a computer when it could be this dangerous? Some people think actually help you with things like hand-eye cordination. but, do you actually think computers can help? The whole time, you are just sitting and starring at a screen as it changes when you click your hand. this is not what you want to be doing. Obeasity is a very large issue for @CAPS2 and computers are not adding to resolve the issue. A local nutritionist told me,"" if everyone would not use computers and @NUM3 of this country would be obeas."" @CAPS3 of being lazy on the computer you could go on outside feeling the fresh air. Not only sit preventing exercise, it wastes alot of time. Websites on the computer try to be addicting so they can get alot of views, in fact there call addicting @LOCATION1. Whily your being glued to @CAPS4 websites your wasting lots of time that could be use for oppertunities like family game night or even homework. You can probly realize computers will obviously not help you. Computors have a fairly expensive lost that comes with it. They are not a cheap item and after you buy one you also have to pay for the electricty needed to run it. Just to add on you'll have to spend money on virus protection and office applications. People shouldn't waste so much money on a electronic that will waste your time, exspeciallyin such the many crisis we are all in today. A survey proved @NUM4 to or @NUM5 workers will work to save up computers. That money could be used for family vacations or sport programs, something worth it. unnecassary payments for a computer is not a good decision. Paying loads of money to look at a glowing screen is one of the worst things. I have heard of these computers will waste your time and prevent you from physical activity. Knowing it could potentially lead a murderer to you and give out your private information, now who would want thats I am fully against computors and the effect they have on people and so should you."	2206	
2207	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 would life be like with out computers? They are very important to @CAPS7 society. People use computers and other electronics everyday for their business, communication, or simply inst for leasure. @CAPS3 should be advances in computers because they teach people hand and eye coordination, are people the ability to learn about faraway places using the internet, and even talk on line with people miles away. To begin with, computers can help us develope hand and eye coordination. @CAPS2 is simply done when we type and look at the screen while we are writing a paper for class, responding to an e-mail, or even searching a word on @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON3, biologist that specializes in animal's hand and eye coordination says ""Hand and eye coordination is four in many and is important to the survival.

Websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 like skype are fun ways to communicate with friends in town or relatives across the globe. But @CAPS2 is also vital the military. Major @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 computers are one of @CAPS7 most important tool that we use. If a squad heeds are support, soldiers can use laptops to call in missle support from @CAPS8 @CAPS9 air crafts."" Computers are very important advances in communications. I hope that I have given you enough reasons to make advances in computers. I will"	2207	
2208	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do computers really effect people as a whole? It has been brought to my attention that some people believe, the computer has negative effects on our society. I believe that these pieces of technology have a positive outcome on us. They give us the ability to learn about other places around the globe, it allows us to talk to friends and family and they also provide a source of entertainment. Don't you ever wonder what's outside the borders of our country? Well many @CAPS3 do now and then, With computers, we have the oppurtunity to learn about life styles different than our own. Just by surfing the web we can find all sorts of different information that we all crave. For instance, you can find out what types of food are eaten in @LOCATION1 with no hassle. With just click of a button, many different sources appear for easy arress. Wouldn't you like to discover what's out there with a click of a button? Aren't there any relatives of friends that live far away that you wish to speak too? Well, technology has given you an easy way to communicate called the computer. While online, you and just about everyone else can go in a chat room or e-mail/@CAPS4 session, which allows us to talk to one another. Family members can catch up on the latest news, while old friends can share favorite Even I use the computer to keep up with my family because they all live out or state. Don't you wish to stay caught up with friends and family of your own? Has this over happened to you? You plan a nice day outside and then the weather turns for the worst? @PERCENT1 of our population has gone through this problem. If you must stay inside then why most use the computer? Even though you can't go outside there are of games and applications on computers that can pass the time. What better use can there be for our computers besides entertainment? Computers effect our as a whole in a positive light. I believe they give us a strong, positive effect on our lives. They allow us to learn about other places around the globe you can use them to keep up with family and friends, and they can entertain us when we need it. Please take my arguements into consideration when choosing your side of this arguement."	2208	
2209	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a lot of effects on people. They could keep people from getting outside and enjoying the weather, which is a bad thing. Computers maybe good for interacting with people, such as family and friends, but they also maybe bad for our health. Computers have a big effect on people because they keep you from getting up and moving around. They keep you from excersing which could be a health problem. It's worse for children my age and older because all the social networking is keeping us from doing other things that we normally never do. Another effect that computers have on people is interacting with people you don't know or family members by using a webcam. It might be fun to talk to people you don't have a clue about, but you have to be careful because you don't know what's going on to happen after you finish talking to him/her. The lost effect that computers people is doing research. A lot of children have to do research on the computer. Whether it being for a project or for regular homework. This is a big effect because there are a lot of websites on the internet, and it's most likely that you're not going to find all the information that you need, because most of those websites talk about things that don't involve in the subject you're trying to search up. This is also a big affect because you could be sitting at your computer for hours and end up not finding anything. These are all the effects that I think computers have on people and maybe someday we could change them."	2209	
2210	1	"Dear local news paper, People should use more computer because you learn more about mathematics, you can learn about different country, and you can talk to your friends. @PERCENT1 of people is learning more mathematics on the computer than the teacher teaching them. When I went to the computer I really learned lots of new things that my teacher never taught me. I promise you that if you go to the computer you will learn lots of new things that your teacher taught. Also the computer gives you short cut to get the answer. I really wanted to learn about @LOCATION2. I wanted to speak their language. So I went to the computer and I learned their language. I also wanted to know what they eat and wear. After I read about they eat my teacher never taught me that I never relise that and my teacher was surprise. @PERCENT2 of people talk to friends at the computer. If you have a friend that lives far away from you and it will cost you money to talk in the phone just go on the computer and talk to your friends. If there was no computer at @LOCATION1? People will not become smart. Also they wont get to talk to there friends. Everyone will be bored. They wont have nothing to do. We also wont know what the weather will be like. Also you will never know if people do become smart with the computer. Well I know it is true people become smart with the computer."	2210	
2211	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, ""Computers have become great advances in technology. However the way humans are being affected isn't in the most positive manner. It is nessesary for people to limit computer time."" according to world renown psychologist, @PERSON1. The question then is do computers affect humans in a positive or negative way. I firmly believe that this advance in technology isn't the best. Now adays with computers people aren't keeping to a diet and exercising. All they do is sit in front of the computer screen. By not getting the exercise every person needs people become overweight and obese which could also lead to other health problems. Could you picture yourself over the years slowing gaining pounds because you made the mistake of not exercising, but dillydallying on the computer? Then computers have also made people lazy. For example one might just send an e-card instead of a birthday card because they didn't ""feel up to"" getting out of the house. If people were training for a particular sport intensly and all of a sudden stopped due to the ""pull"" of their computer all of their previous hard work would be for nothing. The water is rushing by you as one arm goes in and the other out. Your feet are kicking, but slowly your hours of training seem to be disappearing and being replaced by computer time. Due to the effect of computers people aren't even able to enjoy nature. The beautiful trees are growing and the rose bushes are blooming magnificent flowers, however almost no one notices them anymore. Everything outside is lovely but people don't experience it because of this technology. People today aren't even receiving fresh air fromstaying inside all cooped up. According to the @ORGANIZATION1 in every @NUM1 people who have @ORGANIZATION1 will have a more severe case if they don't get the recommended amount of fresh air needed. Since people don't even enjoy nature anymore because they are on computers all day they care for it less as well. I have observed that whenered people are outside they just dispose of their garbage in a horrible manner, and don't pay attention to where it might end up. I can understand the point of view that you can meet and make new friends online, however this in a sense causes one to lessen interaction with friends and family. Smart and well informed people will not spend large somes of time on the computer to stop interaction with others. Some other people though seem to be caught in their own little world on the computer. It is extremly easy for people to lose friendships because of the computer. I know this from personal experience since I too used to spend to much time on it. I had been spending so much time on the computer that one of my friends became fed up with me and wouldn't really talk to me after it. Then also one's family might feel abandoned by a person from the excessive time spent on this technology. There it is time to realize that computers have a bad effect on people. Almost no one receives their daily exercise to keep them healthy. People then also forget about nature and how to enjoy it. Most of all though it clearly affects the relationships between friends and family. Therefore it is time to take action."	2211	
2212	1	"There have been many advances in technology over the last hundred years, one of which, being the computer. Though, this invention has benefitted humanity greatly, it has also had many negetive effects as well. Three of these neagtive effects are people are spending to much time online and less time execising, interacting with friends and family, and last but not the least, cyber bullying. Recently, many kids, student, and adults of all ages have spent much more time with computers and videogames when they could be spending that time on other outdoor activities such as sports, biking, hiking, etc. Through studies have shown that computers can teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS1 sure that you could learn that much better by doing some other physical activity. Also, with the of exercise due to technology like computers, many more people have become overweight and the problem can only get worse. Now-a-days people commonly rely on computers for simple things such as news and communication. Since almost everything is available online these days, many people dont find the need to leave there own home anymore. As computers become slowly more entertaining to a individuall, they dont find the need of interactions of friends and family anymore for entertainment. Would you like to have a anti-social son or daughter because I know it wouldn't. This is just another reason that shows how computers have had a negative affect on us."	2212	
2213	1	"Dear local newspaper, I don't think that computers effect people instead I think it makes them smarter. One example that can support my opinion is that when you researh online you get to understand more stuff. Another example that can support my opinion is that you can chat with people from other contrys. My last example is that you can surch about your absesters if you dont know nothing about them. These examples shows how computers can make you smater. When you reserch online you get to understand. more stuff. For example if you need help with your school work and you dont have no one to help you, you could use the computer and it will help you understand what you need to understand. Maybe you need more information on a topic if you research about it the computer will help you. This is important because computer can make you understand topics you dont know about. My second example is that you can chat with people from other contrys and learn about their habitat. For example while your chating with them they could tell you stuff you dont know about their contry. This is important because you could learn stuff about other contrys. My last examples that you can surch about yoor ansesters if you dont know nothing about them. For example you could find out stuff you did not know about them. This is important because you get to know about you. Tradition more. Like from where they come from how many generations are in your family and more stuff. As a result I think every one should use computers because they help you understand more stuff, learn about other contrys, and learn about your ansesters. I hope I changed your mind about computers."	2213	
2214	1	"I think that computers are good in some ways, like you can talk to people online like on myspace, yahoo, messenger, aim and much more more. If you have to do a project on @CAPS1 @LOCATION1 you can look him up and get the information you need instead of looking in a book trying to find some information. And if you need some pictures on some one you can go to google of @CAPS2. But in the other hand those are some bad thing about computers too, like for example myspace, you can get and horased and made fin of, anf there is a lot of people that are fake on myspace, people can just get some one's elses pics and put them on and say that they are who you see and there can be people that like to cyberbully. You can get in trouble too, if you tell some one you age, name, or even you adress, stranger can come to you house. And if you like you computer alot and you like to download alot of softeare you can get alot of virusis much leads to mesing up you computer. And there is a thing call spyhore wore some one can hack or you computer is already hacked some on might be hocking what you are doing on the computer and it is not good because you can use it is not good because you can use it for bad thing like hocking things, like computers, sites, sometimes, and much more. And it is a must of money because it can set messed up and just for one computer is like. But it is usefull for life beacuse you can get stuff and order stuff you can buy thing on the internet like household apliences, and thing you can have fun with for example a toy, if you are looking for a car toy and no one has it that lives around you, you can just go on the computer and look it up."	2214	
2215	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People all around the world use computers everyday. I believe that computers have very good effects on people all over the world. One positive affect that computers have very good effects on people all over the world. One positive affect that computers have on people is that we are able to learn a great deal of information of topics that we never knew existed. Another good effect is that people are able to interact with other people around the world. The lost good effects that computers have an people in that we are able to research objects that we @MONTH1 purchase in the near futer and buy it online. People, everyday use computers to learn about topics that they know existed. To this day, I have had multiple projects due for history, @CAPS3, and almost every other subject. If I did not have acess to a computer I would not have done nearly do well as I have. I am working on a project in history class about @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, The I chase was @PERSON1, or great secretary of stud and military leader, there aren't many books in our library about him so I go straight to the computer. The computer always have information on any topic or object last week I look a survey, and over @PERCENT1 of all the students in my school use the computer and internet for either there homework or projects. That is one reason how computers have a positive affect on people and children. Using the computer can also help you interact with friends, family or even people you don't knew and would like to meet. Almost @PERCENT2 of all adults over the age of @NUM1 have @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. On those webistes you are able, in meet new people and talk to your friends. I have a @CAPS8 account and it is good people meet new people and become more with their lives. I have more provids on my account and I can talk to them all the them. The by if for example that are still while we in the @LOCATION1. My mother keeps with our relatives in @LOCATION2 by @CAPS8 on its tiny are still with us. That is my secon computer people everyday. Computers are for buy in the . Using this you are not money because you can as much time and the object. Last your for my birthday I on that as in @CAPS9 car and I got over @NUM2 million hits. I reasearched the cars and round the one the suited me and was not less expensive. I believe that researching objects can save you time and many. For example, if you go to a store and the store does not have the item then you just lost aproxiounetely @NUM3 hours. You @MONTH1 also waste money becasue if you just search the object you want, then you are able to see where the lowest price is. The computer can save a tirp to a store by just ordering your item right from the internet. My mother always busy my shoes and her paper online because she does not have the time to go shop for one. That is my last reason why computers really do have a positive affect on people. Now you how why computers have a positive affect on peoples lives everyday. Computers help students leanr about topics for school, they help people interact with other people and save you time and money while shopping for items. I strongly suggest that you agree with my arguement, computers affect and help everyone with their lives. P.S. strongly recomend you agree with my argument."	2215	
2216	1	"I strongly support advances in technology. Computers make tasks very simple. You can talk to your family the internet, play a game, do school work and hundreds of other tasks that you wouldn't be able to do as well as you @CAPS5 with a computer. My entire immediate family lives in @LOCATION1. All of them. Every aunt, uncle, grand parent and cousins don't live near me at all. It costs an insane amount of worry to make international calls to them, so I don't. I connect with my family through instant message, e-mail and @CAPS1. (A social networking site) I can post pictures to @CAPS1 as can my relatives, and I can cousins grow up. All @NUM1 of them. My cousin @PERSON1 and I talk almost every day through the computer. We're tighter than spandex on a guy and yet, we live hundreds of miles apart. that allow my family to connect. my essays have you type up? do you recieve via e-mail, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4? I'm you rely on computers to get information, just as much as you need to create spreadsheets and This was certainly The itself @CAPS5 you imagine if you had to draw each these up? Four something for every greater take give you some idea as to how important computers are to society. I know that some people would say that @ORGANIZATION1's aren't important ( agree) but, to you, they must be very important you administer This might you by surprise. My eh? Or maybe a bunch of people do I can see how one would become obese from spending every free moment on the computer. I haven't met one overweight person who isn't aware that they are overweight. Some choose to do something about it, such as myself. Some people are ditching their social for @CAPS6. (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 Online @CAPS9 @CAPS10) @CAPS11? not really, @CAPS12? Definitely. People usually know when they aren't exercising or not having a social life. They just choose to not do anything about it, and this is not society's fault, so why are we being blaimed for it? You don't know? Neither do I. In conclusion, computers are wonderful tools for those who utalize them appropriately."	2216	
2217	1	"I strong it hurt people are using computers to they are not enjoying nature. Some people like my brother, he first the day the computer soccer he doesn’t want to go. I think they stop making computers to tried to make people the nature. See if the stop ussing the computer. People go to the computer to talk to other people look at the web to see if they a new computer to buy. Finally, I now i that they should stop making computer to people to explor the nature with there fimaly."	2217	
2218	1	"Dear Newspaper, I don't think that we spend to much time on them because we go to school work we go outside and we and not everbody has them. This is why I think that we don't spend that much time on the computers. Everybody mostly gos to school or work witch means less time on the computer and as they drive to school or work they will be able to look at the nature. And also most kids and adualts go to school or work for at least eaght hours a day. witch keeps them of the computer for quight a while. Also from my exsperence what I do and most my friends do is go on the computer when we get home checck our facebook, myspace, youtube, and aim acconts the get off and go hangout after we hang out I will go on the computor for like @NUM1 hours a day thats all. That is one reson why I think that we don't use computers that much. Most people go outside once a day or more @CAPS1 that I go outside everday to bmx or go to an @CAPS2 skatepark. Also many people cannat afrod computers there for they never go on computer. So they go outside and sit on the streets and do nothing also many people love to go outside and just have fun out there and not be on the computer @NUM2, and also many people would probly get bored of sitting on the computer all day I no I would be very bored @CAPS3 I was on the computer all day. So I would go outside. That is my second reason why I think we don't use computers that much. Lastly not everbody has one. The reson not everbody has them is because not everbody got the money to be a computers even @CAPS3 they by a computer they might not be able to pay the internet bill witch means this will keep them of the computer because its no fun without the internet. Also some people don't have them because they don't want one. someoder people do not want the new technolgy because there use to having what they had when the were a kid growing up also @CAPS4 might be to complecated for some of the old people to use a computer. That is my thrid reson I think we do not use computers that much. To wrap @CAPS4 all up I think we don't use computers that much because of school and work being outside and lastly not everbody has them to be used. That is why we are not using computers to much."	2218	
2219	1	"Dear: Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that people are using computers for positive effects. The technology of the computer gives people the ability to learn, talk to friends, and also look online for other important reasons. The technology of a computer helps people with hand-eye coordination. I think computers are a positive effect to benefit society. People all around the world use computers for different reason @CAPS1 is a great thing that we have technology like computers now in days. My first reason is about using the computer for the ability to learn. Sometimes students need a computer to help them in a sertend subjet for example: a kid needs help with math there websites that he or she can go on to help them get better with math. Theres website's teachers might give you or also there's websites you can go on like @CAPS2 brain, master math, and other cool, fun, but still educational website for kids to learn. I think computers can be very helpful for student, kids that need a little more help then others. So that was my first reason so lets go to the next reason. My next reason is that teenagers have the ability to talk to friends the internet. I think thats better then having you kids out doing drugs and drink and get them in trouble. Its a great idea to have a computer because then your kids can have fun talking to there friends online teens can run up there phone bills. And teen dont only have to talk to friends online they can talk to family members that dont live near by. Teens these day love using computers so parent should say no to hanging out with bad people and say yes to talking ever the computer. My third reason is that kids, teens, grown ups can go online for other importants reasons. For example familys might want to go on trips and they want to go online to see were they want to go and stay at. Also familys might be looking for fansie restaurants to eat for a special ocation. So keep in mind computers always come in handy. For prepases like kids need to get better in a subject teens want to talk with friends online, or family vacations. Well thats all I had to say I just want to say one more thing keep this in mind!"	2219	
2220	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe people shouldn't spend their time on computers all the time. Most people that spend all day on the @CAPS4 develope poor social skills, and health problems. Some supporters that like that computers help develope hand-eye coordination, and help people learn about the people and places around the world. Social skills are a necessity to life. People need to know how to interact with others so they can function in susiety. When gamers or computer addicts don't socially involve themselves they become afraid or shy. to be able to have many different kind of jobs its crutial to know how to do buisness with people by talking and being social. Lazy people that just want to stay inside all day and video chat or playing video games online can develope health problems from not being physically active. A friend of mine became diabetic because he would eat lots of junk and not go outsided to burn off all the bad sugars in his body. People @MONTH1 develope diseases were they are dependent on people to take cure of them because they are too afraid of people outside their games world. People can lose contact with the outside world. They might forget where they are or if something happened right down the street they wouldn't know. Computers can have many up-sides to the like learning and hand-eye coordination but there are more down-sides to them than up. If people are on the computer all the time learning about distant places they would spend all their time going online to see it insted of acctually going. I support my idea's of computers harming people if they spend all day @NUM1 on the because of social problems later on in life. Health risks from not being active, and loss to the outside world. These are my reason's why I stand firmly about my opinion."	2220	
2221	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Some people think that using computers benefit the society and some don't. My position on this matter is that it doesn't benefit the society. Mt theories are they use the computer a lot and they don't get out their houses and don't exersice and they don't know how good it feels to go outside just to enjoy it and they also don't know how their family and friend are doing because they haven't talk to them them in a because are computer. Some people don't and exercise because of computers. People are stock on the computer just won't have to exercise just recently my weight and be spent all told him that and so he now had free time and be started to work out and he got fit. But for his birthday she bought him a laptop now he doesn't go to the @CAPS1 to workout he goes to on his laptop and now he's getting big again. You see when he had a somputer he was they took it away he lost weight but when he got back in the all back, and it all because of the computer. Being outside good its in the @DATE1 you can camp or swim in pools in which you can but you have a computer. You stay on your laptops and don't get time to go out because you've wasted time on the computer. You can do the but you don't don't get the some you do when you do go outside. The computers you affect your go on the computer to talk or family and friends but it doesn't feel the same as seeing them in person. According to student studies @PERCENT1 of people who spend most time on computer than seeing family are like to have postamatic stress. What is that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are stress out from not talking or seeing family and friends due to spend too much time on computers. Yes we know @CAPS2 and playing are fun but it costs out time you could be spending with friends and family or @CAPS2 outside and exercising to be healthy and fit.

Computer fix that by improving hand-eye coordination, educational purposes and allow a degree of communication. I believe computer are a huge technical advancement in our time. First, computers help with hand-eye coordination. Sports @CAPS2 said that kids do well in sports due to fast reflexes from hand-eye coordination. Also, parents noticed their kids are multi-tasking more easily. Experts also say that kids are writting faster thanks to hand-eye coordination. Next, computers are a huge part of education. There are many courses that people can take online. Dr. @DR1, a social studies @CAPS3, says that its easier to teach class with online activities. Also, in @CAPS3’s magazine, a poll shows that that out of @NUM1 students @NUM2 would rather study online than from a book. Computers can really make school more interesting. Finally, computers have a degree of communication. Kids can also contact their relative from around the world. Also, advertisements are posted on the web. Buisness men say that @PERCENT1 of their advertisments is online. Phycologys say that kids can build their communication skills online. Now @CAPS1 kids using effective ways to study,playing sports, and talk to their relatives whenever they want. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, help educate, and improve communications. So @PERSON1 post my artical to explain how useful computers can be!"	2222	
2223	1	"Computers are a fairly new invention. Years ago, computers were so big it took a whole room to store one, but now, with advances in tecnology, laptops centimeters than, and touch screen @CAPS1 have become regular sights in homes all across @LOCATION1, but is this a good thing? Computers can help people learn new things, teach hand-eye coordination, and can introduce to a bunch of great new people. Therefore, I would say, yes computers are a good thing, and every citizen should have one. Years' ago, if a student needed to look up facts for a project, he/she would have had to go all the way to library to get that information, and the back they need could already be checked at! Now what? Because of @ORGANIZATION1, another search engines, info is available with the click of a button, therefore this problem would never have come up. Futhermore, @ORGANIZATION1 also has pictures that are free an easily asseside. But that's not all, all the latest news and celebrity gossip is available as well! You can quickly, easily, and conviently find out about important events like the earthquake in @LOCATION2 and you could donate money to help the cause as well. More information can only be a good thing, and that's not all a computer Have you ever wanted to be good at sports like tennis, or baseball, but never had enough hand eye coordination? Well studys show that @PERCENT1 of people who played online games for at least an hour a week got better hand-eye coordination in @NUM1 weeks! Games like @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and similar precludes challenge the mind and body to work together and make the body stronger, faster and more which would help to do everyday like driving cars. Furthermore, most people don't play sports because they good of them, but with better reflexes and a quick mind, they could improve at these sports, and help to solve @LOCATION1's obesity problem. This could only be a good thing. Computer's are the key to the char of wellness, all @LOCATION1 must do is provide a hand to learn this key. One of the main concerns for computer critics is that people will spend too much time on the computer, and not enough time interacting with family and friends, however, on the contrary, I feel that computers @CAPS4 the bands between people say someone had a reletive or friend who lived very far away from then, so they never got to see then. Well with a computer, this person could email, I. My or even video chat this person anytime they wanted! Aus, computers allow people to not only talk to known friends, computers also allow users to meet new people and possibly make new friends! Furthermore, computers can help to boost the confidence and self-esteam of shy people. I know that before I started using a computer I was quiet and always scared of what other people would think but taking online helped to boost my confidence, and I'm taking more and making new friends outside of the computer as well as inside. More confident, friends and social people are what say country would want for citizens. Therefore, computers ant the awful burden to society that critics have made then out to be, in bet, computers are great for many things, including learning new things, better hand-eye coordination, and meeting new people, therefore we should encourage everyone to buy a computer today!"	2223

Did you know that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 own a computer? That is because computers help you gain skills that are used multiple times throughout your life. Also, with a computer, people can gain instant access to anything they need. One last reason is that many people use computers to keep in touch with friends or relatives, perhaps those who live far away. It @MONTH1 seem that a computer plays a big role in one's life, and truth is, they @CAPS6 continue helping people build foundations for future careers and goals. Many times, when you look for a job, you have to fill out a resume. A resume shows the business owner @CAPS5 skills you have and @CAPS5 skills you're willing to put forward to help the company. Nowadays, more and more companies have started using computers and knowing how to use one is a basic necessity. ""I'm on a computer every day at work filing claims, doing paperwork, and helping customers,"" says @PERSON1, an insurance under writer in @LOCATION1. If she did not have good typing skills, great hand-eye coordination, and excellent word processing skills, she wouldn't have been hired for the job. The young generation is getting an early start on building that foundation that they @CAPS6 use throughout their futures it @CAPS6 sure come in handy someday. Say you're a reporter for channel @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1. There's a breaking story that your audience needs to hear as soon as possible. You log onto your computer to find instant information on the story. Your twitter feed is exploding with the exciting @ORGANIZATION1 and now you have material to report on for your @ORGANIZATION1 report. The moral is, with a computer people gain instant access to @ORGANIZATION1, whereas, they might have to wait hours for the local @ORGANIZATION1 report, or in this case, they are the reporter looking for. Resident of @LOCATION3, @PERSON2 says ""The @CAPS3 homepage is one of my daily fixes. I check it multiple times a day!"" overall, that goes to show that people all over the world can be aware of the latest happenings on their planet. The last, and possibly most important reason for computers is to keep in touch with people. You can easily sign onto @CAPS4 and talk with your cousin who lives all the way in @LOCATION2. Or the friend that you miss who only lives an hour away. One knows that social networking is a daily stop, and it's an awesome way to keep in contact. @PERCENT2 of the people in the world have some type of instant messenger all their, a recent study showed you just have plans with your friend and can't remember @CAPS5 time to meet. A quick virtual message saying ""@CAPS5 time do you want to go?"" @CAPS6 solve your problem. That is instant communication at its' finest. I hope that you're convinced that computers are after all a great thing. People build everyday life skills, they have fast access to the latest @ORGANIZATION1, and you can keep in touch with people that you don't normally get to talk to. Now, which one of the @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 who don't own a computer are going out to buy one? In conclusion, computers help people through daily life, and I would sure hope you consider purchasing one."	2224	
2225	1	"Hortford @CAPS1, I believe that the effects of computers are negative. There are mainly @NUM1 ideas why I think they are negitive. First reason is @CAPS2. The computer effects your @CAPS2 because your sitting on a choir. Stairing at the bright computer screen for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hrs. While you could be outside exercising. Runnig around having a great time with friends and family. Second reason is @CAPS3. The computer effects your @CAPS3 because you sit at your computer playing games or on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 but your not learning anything. You should be doing homework or you could write on essay. You should be writing or reading everyday. Last reason is recycle. While your on the computer you probly printed @NUM1 or @NUM2 papers and thats a waist of paper. You just killed a tree. Trees and flowers are what give us air and were killing tress for computer paper. Now do you see why the effects of the computer are bad and I hope you agree."	2225	
2226	1	"Computers are one of the most important forms of technology in society today. There are so many different ways to use them, and they are a major tool for success in @CAPS1, education and engineering. They teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about most anything and can be used for communication between people who live far away. I think computers are a great tool and that they should be more positively recognized for all the good they help people do every day. Computers teach us many things. We learn hand-eye coordination from moving the mouse with our hands and seeing the cursor on the screen move too. Babies can also learn special software about colors and sounds. Interactive games help children of all ages learn and undersatand the things around them. My cousin loved looking at the computer screen when she was a baby. It really helped her to learn about colors and sounds, as it does for many babies. Computers are a very good early learning tool. Without computers, I don't see how I would be able to know so much about places I have been to. Sure books help, but I bet a lot of information found in books was originally on the internet or atleast double checked using the internet. The computer also has more visuals and pictures of what distant places look like. I @MONTH1 never really see the great wall of @LOCATION2, but I can atleast get an idea of what it looks like from photos taken a postedl to a website. The computer can be used for finding nearly any type of information and really helps people understand too! A few years ago, my best friend moved away to a differrent state. I was really sad to see her go, but I felt better that I could email her and send her pictures of what was going on here in @LOCATION1. Through the computer, we have stayed friends and are now able to instant message every night to keep in touch. Friends are not the only people who do this, however, @CAPS1 corperations talk to other corperations over a webcam. A person who couldn't attend a meeting can log on and see what their co-workers are saying, almost as if they were really there. Online communication is a really great tool to use in @CAPS1 and normal life alike. So, computers @MONTH1 have a few miner drawbacks but overall they are a great advancemant in technology and a huge part of our society. They teach important skills, give information about almost anything and provide a quick, easy form of communication to just about anywhere in the world. Overall, computers are a great resource and can help people today in so many ways. I believe that computers have a very positive affect on people in our world today."	2226	
2227	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the @NUM1 century is often referred to @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 of Technology due to the fact that many technological advances have been achieved. One of these such advantages is the computer. These have been disputes over whether the computer benefits society, or damages it. @CAPS1 helpful @CAPS1 the computer @MONTH1 be, it ultimately does not benefit society in the long run. Exessive use of the computer causes health problem, prevents people from enjoying nature and does not promote actual @CAPS3 to @CAPS3 inteaction with others. Many health problems today have been associated with the excessive use of electronics and computers. High blood pressure, obesity and strain on the eyes and hands can somehow be connected to computer. These are problems that @MONTH1 impact ones ability to work and could pose severe health hazards. Obesity and high blood pressre coupled together greatly hightens the risk of heart disease while eye and hand problems @MONTH1 greatly reduce the ability to function in and outside of a home environment. In fact, a recent study shows that @NUM2 out of every @NUM3 excessive computer users suffers some kind of health problem. In conjuction, Computers also prevent many people from going outside and interacting with nature, whether it be playing outside or simply taking a walk. Studies taken by @ORGANIZATION1 show that these simlpe interactions help reduce stress and work wonders for our own health. However, a vast majority of people do not experience this due to the fact that they are constantly distracted by the lure of the computer. In another study, it shows that these inteactions also help improve happiness levels and would result in a much happier person. But, like so many of us we do not go outside to enjoy the simply joys in life. Last, computers do not promote @CAPS3 to @CAPS3 contact. Although many would that computers help people across the globe interact with one another, it does not promote the actual to the human psyche. Studies conducted by varrous laboratories around the world all agree that the human mind craves for person to person contact. The computer cannot provide this contact, therefore the mind of a crucial past of our lifestyle. Due to these computers, society and our own bodies are slowly but surely being damaged in a way that could be irreversable."	2227	
2228	1	Dear the @ORGANIZATION1 I think that computers are positive to people. I say that because people could use a computer for there colledge work. Also we can use it to find out more about things like @CAPS1. The computer will give us more details about it. The computer can help us with writing if are hands are hurting or your arm is broken you can use it to type. Plus the computer can help us print out pictures because if we don't know how to draw a picture than all we have to do is go on the computer to print out things. We can also use the computer for directions like if we can't afford a gps we can use the computer to print out directions. We can also use the computer to buy things like a car if we can not find the dealership we can go on the computer and buy one and have shiped off to us. So that is why computers are positive to people.	2228	
2229	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently read from my next door neighbor that the @ORGANIZATION1 wants to know peoples opinion on the advantages of computers. Mark the science specealist says that @PERCENT1 of people think that computers are bad. The other @PERCENT2 think computers are awsome. In my opinion computers are great. First of all, computers help people learn their hand-eye coordination. Computers are future. By typing on the computer all the time you barn that your fingers have a mind of their own, @PERCENT3 of my second grade english class learned how to type. The other @PERCENT4 learned after. My mother learned how to type when she was @NUM1. She is now @NUM2 and just getting hand-eye coordination. By the children learning how to type they will have hand-ey coordinaiton by their teen years. Secondyl, when you go on vacation you can still be at school. By having computers no one any exusests miss school. My friend @PERSON1 lives in @LOCATION1 and come over to she was on the computer for @TIME1. When she went back to school her teacher didn't have to go out of her way to teach her. By having computers people can go anywhere. @PERSON1 traveled across the world and did it! So having computers is a huge advantage when it comes to vacation or even being sick. Lastly, computers have a posative advantage/ outcome on people. By people not having to deal with having writer's cramp because you could type. have you ever gotten a writing cramp? If you have you know that it is very uncomfortible. Doctors have prmen that people will put more on paper when they type, also that getting writer's cramp can cause arthritous in your hand. Everybody gets writer's cramp even pre-k children. The little kids are always coloring. In conclusion, I think that having computers is a very good advantage. By helping with handeye coordination hey help people when they go away on vacations, and computers have a posotive outcome on people. So you see computers aare very helpful. You should like computers too."	2229	
2230	1	"Dear newspaper, I would like to let you know that, I think computers are a great product to use. People are able to do all thngs with computers. Including checking email or chat with friends. We also are able to see ehat the weather will be like instead of waiting for the @CAPS1 to come on learning about places out of state or in another country, can be activated with the touch of a mouse. Without checking email everyday my mom would be lost and would not know what to do. She makes sure sports and appointments are not cancelled. IF she were not to have email, we would drive all the way to the places and just have to go back. Email saves so much time for everyone. Online chatting is another good way to see your friends, and talk about things. The only bad thing is that your not getting some fresh or at the same time. You can meet so many new people and expand your friendship. Weather needs to be checked all the time by people to make sure the roads wont be bad or to wonder about a baseball game. My dad makes me also get on the computer and go to weatherchannel.com. This is because he us learning for work the next day and does not want it to snow. The good thing about getting the weather online is that if is so quick, when you would have to wait for the @CAPS1 to come on and tell you. It could waste a lot of time. And if the computer is bad, isn't the couch bad too? How about the video tour? yes, the computer will give you one of those for your favorite place. You are now able to go places without the plane. You can go on the computer now research the place you want. This helps on projects, because they are able to get everything they need to know and put it onto a paper. This could also help people decide where to go for a trip. If you want to go to @LOCATION1, then you search it and could find out how much it would cost, or what places to visit while there. The effects that computers have on us, are not bad, you just want to use it more. Yes go on when they get home, but at school they have recess and gym. People don't get fat if they sit on the computer, they get fat depending on what they eat. You should really be tring to fight eating adiction not computer adiction."	2230	
2231	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, The effects computers can have on people can be good, and bad. I happen to think computers are a good help to the society. Having a computer is like having your own little reference to anything. Would you rather go out and by a ton of books, and talk to a lot of people, or just sit at home and find what you need immediately? Everybody now just wants it to be quick and simple. Next, just like before, there are kids with homework. When people have research to do for homework, they go on the computer. So, having a computer isn't such a waste of time. Although kids and people can get distracted, but hopefully they will spend their time wisely. A computer is what this century uses, and needs. Sometimes, a computer can have the wrong information, but these is more than one sights. If you compare a computer to a book, your information is more limited with the. Have you ever mised the news on television and was eager to learn ? Well the computer is neede them too. The computer teaches you, and informs you what is going on in day life. If you think about it, the television will the news, but the computer can probably inform you. The television is. If there are certain places you need to go of learn about, the fastest way is the computer. Are you understanding my point, @CAPS2, the computer is an easier way of communication. These are many instant messaging sites, or a friendly environment, for ex. facebook. Being able to talk to people on lie computer is less complicated, you killing to a at people. The different variety at people that use the computer to talk probably get rid at their phone and the bill because no one uses it. You can also connect with people in different countries or. If you have a family, you can learn each others traits, and see the difference in religion. The more you know and learn, the more knowledgable and comfortable you'll be if you visit. That is a great experience to rope for. In conclusion, a computer isn't just a waste of time. The computer is just a piece of material that is filled with information and ways to conect with people @CAPS3 is bad about it, unless someone uses it the wrong way, or is distracted. Try to understand, that there is everything you can possibly need to know on the computer!"	2231	
2232	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a very interesting question going around lately. Do computers do more positive or negative acts for people? My guess is that they cause much harm for the human race computers are causing many teens and young adults to be unhealthy. Computers are also very expensive, and seem to take away the hand in family. Computer are not enhancing our physical or mental environment. Computers are keeping teens and adults cooped up inside rather than enjoying the natural outdoors. It is important that they get outside or go to the gym in order to stay healthy. Computers seem to be holding them back. A @CAPS2 named @PERSON1 did some research and in a survey of fifty teens only eight of them would rather be outside or exercising rather than going on facebook all day. Computers are bringing down our rate of health. Because of computers people would rather surf the web and order their groceries rather than go to the store and walk around the aisles. Local gym owner @PERSON2 @CAPS3 that since computers have been the cool treend his gym members have been cancelling memberships because they don't have time to get to the gym. they don't have time because they are too busy walking on computer games. Gym have gone down about @PERCENT1 , yet hte computers keep . Computers and the take their toll on people . It is to a point when people are planning schedules around their computer life. Locak bakery @PERSON4 @CAPS3 taht people make and are late to them up because they were busy world and got caufht up in happy . Computers are to yet invesive in peoples lives, and it is . the through, "" you @MONTH1 look any way you want on the had you will always be your real self, so stop living virtually! ""@CAPS3 of country cuts"" in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4. Computers can be helpful, but to a certain extent. Take my advise and change your life style. Computers are quite expensive especially when everyone is tight on money these days. People are paying extra for games, internet, and even everyday softwear! People are so addicted to computers and they will pay any price for that little satisfactor of going on a pointless website. Computers are having a large impact on us and on our packets. We have been spending too much on computers. Best @CAPS5 cahser @PERSON3 @CAPS3 I never thought people would go out of their way to pay this much crazy"" which goes to prove that the human race will give up their money for computers rather the things family vacations. America needs to smarten ups and stad forgetting computers because they are only going to hurt us."	2232	
2233	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 respect my opinion. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. There are three major reasons why I think that. They are: they help people with hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about faraway places and people increases, and to talk online with others. @CAPS2 respect my opinion; I will defend it throughout the rest of my paper. My first reason defending my opinion is that it helps with hand-eye coordination. This will help you in all sports. Mostly, all sports involve hand-eye coordination . By using it with typing and the computer; it can increase your sport skills. For example, baseball is a sport that needs alot of hand-eye coordination. Typing on the computer and looking up at the screen, at the same time can help you in baseball. It can help you by seeing when the ball is coming and then you swing. That is coming and then you swing. That is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. My second reason why I think computers have a positive result on people is because they allow you to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project to do on @LOCATION1 you can search it online and get all of the information you need. A lot of new things have been invented for the computer including languages. So, if you need to learn a language and you don't have time to go to a class; you can learn online the same way. That is my second reason why I think computers have a positive outcome on people. My third reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because they get to talk online to people, either through a network, video or audio. For example, if part of your family lives in @LOCATION2, then you can talk to them without the money. You can use networks like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or by e-mail. For video messages you can use ooVoo, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, etc. You can also use those networks for audio. By interacting over the internet. It is bringing you closer to your family - not farther. That is my third reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think that more than half of the effects computers have on people are positive. My three reasons are: hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, and to talk online. @CAPS2 respect my opinions."	2233	
2234	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @NUM1 eye witness news, I have been putting my attention torwds the use of computers. I have noticed that more and more fellow @CAPS2 are indeed addicted to the technology. My concern is that they don't get enough exersize. The other thing I'm worried about is the lack of comunication in families. But my final consern is the safty of your children @CAPS3 a daily exersize rotine is important in every ones life. Well for example, you don't have to struggle watching your weight because you'll be set. In other words your staying fit and focas. But more importantly your keeping yourself healthly. I think that the technology is keeping us from being able to succeed in our health life. I believe that is their wasn't as much internet accees that wouldn't be a problem with the obesity conserns. Communication in any healthy relationship is goal. It's good to talk as a family. I feel that the computer use is keeping us from doing so. Teen agers are hooked on ""@CAPS4 on @CAPS5, twitter, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1!, @ORGANIZATION2"" ect. These websites keep teenagers away from the outside world and family communication. Our society is being brain washed with these new cyber space onlien cummuinities. Your childerns safty is at risk! These online cummunities are putting your child in some serious trouble. These are millions of kids signed on to ""@CAPS7, @CAPS5, twitter, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1!, @ORGANIZATION2"". But as many kids there are there will be more sex-offenders, @CAPS10, and harmful people. Letting your child log on to these is pretty much exposing them into the arms of those people. Remenber its never safe to put any type of information that can harm you or your loved ones. So, I believe that the computer use is just a way to keep you from doing a great life. We all know that we don't want to get hurt so I think that we should limit our computer use. But if your child has one of the websites that were mention please watch out for them."	2234	
2235	1	"Imagine having the whole world in a screen in front of you. With the @CAPS1 you can socialize more. You can also learn more, quicker and get insperation for things to do away from the computer. I believe that the computer benefits the society. There are so many things on the computer to make socializing more efficient. Rather than sending letters in the mail, which wastes paper, you can send emails to your friends email address. If you want to have a conversation, instead of calling someone far away and get long distance fees, you can talk to them with a webcam. To get in touch with old or new friends you can use social networking sites which are becoming more and more popular. The computer makes socializing easier. If you wanted to learn about a new topic without a computer you would have to drive to the library search for a book then come back to the library to return it. This might discourage some kids from learning. If they used a computer they would quickly be able to find the information they needed on the @CAPS1 without any of the hassel. With this time saver they might have time to learn more about different topics. The computer makes it a lot easier to learn. There are a lot of sites that might inspire people to go out and have fun. For example, if you are learning about animals you would quickly be able to find the nearest zoo and how much it costs. There are even sites with cupons to save money while you are out having fun. There are even sites to tell you where it is fun to go as a family. The computer can inspire fun trips with your friends or family. Overall, the computer has a lot of benefits. It makes socializing and gaining knowledge easier. It can also inspire you to go out and have fun. The computer benefits society."	2235	
2236	1	"Computer are good to have in society. They teach people about far away places, helps me socailize and lets the person relax. Computers teach people about far away places. You see I have trouble learning about @LOCATION1 when I was there because I can'@CAPS2 understand what they so the internet it in @CAPS1, plus certain places I want to learn about I can'@CAPS2 go to since it is dangerous. Since I am @NUM1 I can'@CAPS2 use a plane to travel because I'm young. My parents don'@CAPS2 have the money to travel so the computer helps me learn about these places. The computer helps me socailize on a regular basis. I can talk to my family in @LOCATION1 since I can'@CAPS2 go there. I can talk to ,my friends which is nice since I can'@CAPS2 see them often. Sometimes y I can send emails which doesn'@CAPS2 cost me a penny oppered to writing a letter which costs money. A comuter also allows you to make your e-mails neat, opposed to messy writing. Computers @MONTH1 help some people relax. You could pay alot of games. Some are even multi player so more than one person can play. You can play music from the internet and then download it. On top of that you can even watch some shows that you missed or @CAPS2.V. so you won'@CAPS2 miss out. Finally you can get your own virtual form. Computers aren'@CAPS2 always bad for the society. There are some good qualities like socailizing, relaxing, and learning about faraway places. So the computer isn'@CAPS2 that bad."	2236	
2237	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I agree with the experts. I think it is a bad idea to spend all free time on computers. It is always good to go outside and get some fresh air. Also going out and doing activities with friends or family is good too. And the more time you spend on computers, the more likely it is you will become fat! Thats why america is one of the oberstest @ORGANIZATION1 is because we spend more time playing games than exercising or doing activities. Don't you enjoy the feel of the moist air of a spring mornig? I do. Do you think if you stay up all night playing the computer you will be able to witness it? Of course not and you know it. So take a break from @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @NUM1 and go outside. The fresh air is good for you! So put down the mouse and keyboard and maybe even the head-set and get out and go do something. Who wouldn't ant to go to the fresh or on a snowboarding trip with a friend? I know I definitely would. I love being in the water or @CAPS3 down the @CAPS4 dodging trees! Also hanging out with friends is way matter than being isolated playing @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5 (world of warcraft) for your week with a tower of learning pizza bakers like that guy @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. That isn't good. Because if you stop going out your not going to go out anymore! Then your not going to have all the friends you to and once you realize that your going to be upset and your going friends and family. And who couldn't use a good muscle tone? I know I could. Thats why I started playing less computer games and up the basketball and have been playing a ton more of that. For instance me and my team won the @CAPS6 small division league @CAPS7!!! (I'm # @NUM2) we won because our coach made us wors herd, and we got exercise that made our bodies stronger. Thanks to our coach we got the exercise we needed and because of basketball it focused our minds on something else other than computer games. So please get out and get some fresh air. Go out and enjoy nature with friends and family. And don't forget to exercise here and there its good for you."	2237	
2238	1	"Dear Local newspaper, In my opinion there are god and bad effects with technology ussage, but the bad effects i think, are worse. Manly because children and people of all ages aren't getting enough exercise, and enjoying the world. Also, with being on the computer all the time, they aren't talking, or spending time with friends. One of the main problems in our society is people getting stolen, and you could meet someone bad and tell them personal things if you begin to trust them. So as you can see, computers and technology do have some problems. With being on the computer all the time, kids don't get out, and enjoy the freshair. Clearly if you are on your butt all day, everyday, you are gonna get big, or even worse, obese. If the child is young and is on the computer all the time, he could become afraid of being out side, or just never wanting to. If you are staring at a computer screen a lot you eyes get dry, and make you tired, so you will probably just sleep half the day, and then be on the computer. So you obviously need to be outside everyonce in a while. No-one in the world can live a happy life without someone to talk to and thats whats happening to people cause, they are busy on the computer all the time. So clearly if you don't talk to your friends or ever see them you are gonna lose them. If you lose many friends you could become lonely and depressed, and start hiding from everyone. So you will lose all contact with family too, and then start thinking about suicidale, and other bad things, that's always bad. Everything like myspace and facebook is always gnna have bad people on it. If your child starts talking to this person, and gives out personal information he or she could get stolen from you. Who knows what this person is thinking of doing to this child! She or he could get raped, or even murdered! No parent is gonna wanna have that happen to their child. So as you can all see. Computers can be really bad. But, as long as you get out some, hang out with friends, and stay safe you should be alright!"	2238	
2239	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 I'm sure you know there I talk about the effect of computers on people. The amount of inquiry about computers is large. I am there to tell you that these claims are inexplicably one hundred percent incorrect. @CAPS3 there are bad claims being made the good claims rise out of the ashes. Did you know that computers cant be good for our society and believing that computers are bad are tearing down society there is nothing wrong with computers. In fact we use it all the time we talk to friends, learn about far away place we @MONTH1 never visit in our lifetime, the computers teach hand-eye cordination to help better type on keyboards, finnaly they offer you the satisfaction of being able to do things on those rainy days that leave you locked in the house with nothing to do. When we are home alone with nobody to talk to hoe well we keep a social life. Well the answer is this socalled ""problem"" that people speak of known @CAPS3 computers. wouldn;t you like the confort of kicking back realxing and talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. You can really get to know people and connect to family members on the other side of the globe if you wanted to. You know most people have moved from a state or country should you really find it fitting to take away the fastes way to communicate without bringing your phone will every month long distance, no! You know i'm one fiftenth mongollian and i've never been to mongollia. I'm als jewish but i've never been to @LOCATION1 either, doie that mean I'll never learn about them? of course I will, I can get all the information I need about them on my computer. I can find out long , even the such @CAPS3 the biggest mountains or @MONTH1 be the smallest of lakes. Obviously the information I can is rare then I could without a computer to aid me and answer my @CAPS3 well it can teach me about hand eye coordination this will make my typing faster and life easier. Finnaly, on the rainy day in the will you go sleep, eat, watch @CAPS4, or just play around. Well you have to you can go yout computer which offers you more than all of those things. @CAPS3 I've said earlier you can talk to friends, play on line long, or just watch videos on @CAPS5, and all this things and more are offered to you. In conclusion Computers are not a ""problem"" or ""menace to society"" but a key component to our everyday lives and without this in our society would'nt function has it does today it was lack our modern technology and we would live very differently. We use computers to talk to friends, to learn about faraway places, teach handeye coordination, and provides something to do or bad . @CAPS3 you can see computers are okay!"	2239	
2240	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that people use computers to benefits society. I totally agree with this statement. I think this because the computer allows people to talk online with others, give the ability to learn about far away places, teach hand-eye coordinations and positive effect on people. Read on and im sure I will support my reasons with my opinion. The computer allows people to talk online with others. I agree with this policy because, if they don't have a house phone or cell phone they can talk to you online instead a paying the phone bill. Talking online is easier than a monthly phone bill. If their was no computer then we would have to pay the phone bill. More and more people should continue talking online a phone does not have a keyboard like the computer does. This is why I believe people should talk online to friends. The computer gives people the ability to learn more about far away places, and people. If the computer was not invented then we would not have to learn more about far away places, and people. The computer gives people facts and other resoures that we need."	2240	
2241	1	"Dear @PERSON1, I think that people spend two much time on the computer. Inopeople that stay on for hours on end and they don’t even do anything but talk to there friends who they will see at school the next day. The should at least go on for lyke @NUM1 to @NUM2 mins tops I only go @NUM3 about ten mins I dont lyke the computers. If you go on the internet you can talk to anyone in the world. If you just call your friend there wont be problems. You should always have time for your family you should get fresh air dont be inside all the time if you stay on the computers you can start to gane weight from being in one price at a time. Computers are bad for your brain growth and you need to do other things than staying on the internet."	2241	
2242	1	"I do not support advances in technology. I feel that people that use too much technology they won't be as healthy, their social skills will decrease, and more businesses will close. A healthy body is important to every human. But healthiness @MONTH1 be a problem with more technology. If you are on the computer all day, where are you going to find time to excercise? When you eat it needs to be balanced by doing something rather than sitting in a chair. A screen on your computer seems harmless, but really the bright flashes it gives off can really damage your eyes. Being social is a very big part of your life. It's how you make friends and form bonds. Technology, like cell phones, are a disadvantages to a social life. While texting you can't tell if someone is joking, serious, or happy. The texting language used could be a misunderstanding and hurt feelings. It is better to go and talk to the friend in person. Also, if you stay in the house all day, every day, on the computer or playing video games, you might lose some social skills. Then, talking to new people will be harder. Going shopping with your mom might not be too fun, but you have to get food and clothes. If technology grows this activity won't be available. Buying supplies online will be easier and faster. As a result, car companies will go out of business. Our economy isn't doing too good right now, so why do more harm to it? In conclusion, technology will take away our health, social skills, and businesses. Do we want this? No, advances in technology are harmful to the human race and the world."	2242	
2243	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 we like it or not, our society is transforming into a life revolving around technology. This change is inevitable, and, in my opinion, is a positive. By having computers, we as a world are able to advance and recch our highest potential. Therefore, because computers teach hand-eye coordination supply us with research information and allow is to communicate. I believe that computers are a positive contribution to society. To start I believe computers are a positive contribution to society because they teach hand-eye coordination. By developing the skill, individuals can move on to other activities that involve hand-eye coordination such as tennis. Also, the skill of han-eye coordination can also be used in the workforce and @MONTH1 be essential to mantaining a steady job. Either way it is safe to say that by developing hand-eye coordination by using computers, it can end up being a great skill to have as you proceed through life. Another positive contribution given to society by computers is the ability to have information on nearly everything in a matter of seconds. This is beneficial on aspects of learning such as research projects where the desired information is scorcely found in books. By having a computer for research though, the needed information can be found with the click of a button. The computer can also help when you are planning to make an investment but would like to research it prior. You are able to acess customer reviews on the product, or the best price between multiple stores. Lastly, a culture or group of people can be researched and with a firm understanding, their is a chance that they @MONTH1 to be more resacked int the future. Lastly, computers allow those from all around the globe to communicate easily, quickly, and effectively in many ways. To start, computers can help us alert other nations of approaching natural disasters, or they can do the same for us such as what occur of between click and. With a simple computer, thousands of lives could be spared from injury, (or worse). Computers also allow us to send information back from outer space with the pressing issue of overpopulation predicted in the future it is vital that we are looking for alternative ""homes"" in outer space. Thus, the information we gather and transfer back to earth through computers is essential to our societies well being computers can also allow people to stay in touch with their family and friends. Regardless of their locations, computers allow people to solitify their bond through instant message, emails, or face to face video chats. As I previously stated, our world is beginning to revolve around technology, and we can't bring this trend to a hault. Instead of looking at computers as a negetive, we need to view them as the positive tool that develops hand-eye coordination and assist in research and communication and embrace them to the fullest."	2243

Computers have many negative effects on people and is becoming an adiction for many. America has some of the largest people and highest tecnology; computers are unhealthy. Computers pose many problems of all kinds. Advanceing technology is also destroying people's @CAPS10 lives as well. Computers clearly cause more bad than good. Fitness is healthy for human bodies and is a necesity for a long life. However, these days people enjoy chatting on @CAPS5 rather than going outside to hang out. People aren't getting enough exercise and are becoming unfit. The sun provides @CAPS6 @CAPS7 which is good for the skin and good for health. The problem is, too much time is spent in doors on computers so people of all ages don't get enough @CAPS6 @CAPS7. During all this time spent on computers, the @CAPS9 violet lights within the computer graphics are frying the cornia in people's eyes. This causes blindness and makes people perminantly @CAPS3 impared. While on computers people are losing precious time that could be spent with others. With computers preforming tasks better than ever people are missing out on what the world has in store. @PERSON1 is a mother of a computer adict named @PERSON3. ""The quixotic child spends his life with the computer, I don't even know if he has friends"", @PERSON4 stated when she was interviewed. Computers are making people very anti-@CAPS10. @CAPS12 especially. Instead of going out making friend, @CAPS12 would rather go on the computer. ""With less friends these kids will have nothing better to do other than computers, it's like a chain leading into computer adiction!"" @CAPS10 @PERSON2 wrote in his latest, @CAPS11 @CAPS12 article. People have less friends and would rather be on computer chat rooms than hang out with each other. They also iscolate themselves from their families and miss out all fun activities like family hikes or some father son time passing the ole pig skin. Many problems have risen since tecnology has improved. Some people who hardly use computers get viruses and miss an important @CAPS7-mail or students can't type their homework because the computers in a shop. Bullying is also becoming popular on computers. Cyber @CAPS13 write things to make fun of people on the internet. The next day the bullied child would be embarassed because what was written on the internet was viewed by all in the poor childs school. On the world wide web many inappropriate sites are open to all people and could be accidently viewed by a child, scaring him for life. In one of my crazy expierences, my mom was sent pictures of me playing hockey. She forwarded the pictures to my grandparents, who to their surprise, saw bunches of nude pictures of people such as the pope. All my family lives in @LOCATION1 and are very tight and spend time together. Had one of the grandchildren opened that picture, god only knows. Computers no doubt have a negative effect on people. Many live unhealthy and unsocial lives while others @MONTH1 be emotionaly scared. Heith these words or forever hold your peace if one of these insane yet, quite possible events occurs to you."	2244	
2245	1	"@CITY1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 useful for many aspects a the average person's life. Computers most certainly have a negative impact on humans. Many people who use the internet are addicted to it. In addiction computer usage is causing people to become overweight. Furthermore, with all of the online news sites and books, literature is becoming less and less needed. How could something with so many negatives benifit mankind? One of the most severe problems with computers and internet use is addiction. Approximately @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 who use the internet daily are addicted to computers, which is more than the number of people addicted to most illegal drugs. This is making it hard for people to stop using computers, and can cause other problems, such as depression, and can also be a "sase" haven for people or something. When depressed people with low self-esteem create avatar on certain websites they think that the real world no longer matters; they can be who ever want to be online without fear in about what other people think. This quickly becomes addiction because they don't want to leave the cyber world that they live through. @PERCENT2 of internet addicts are depressed, with the number quickly. Now that people spend so much of their lives on the computer obesity is becoming an even bigger issue than ever. Forever, the children without obesity, there is one within. Therefore overweight adult for every for regular adults. Almost @PERCENT3 of senior citizens are overweight. @PERCENT4 of overweight senior citizens use the internet. @PERCENT5 of overweight adults do and. @PERCENT6 of obese children use the internet almost everyday. This much obesity is causing illness, with major issues in of the heart, blood pressure, and strength, fewer kids want to play sports now, and even some kids who do it only do it because their parents force them to. As soon as they finish basket ball practice or the foot ball game, the go home and jump right back onto the computer. Finally, people do not find it necessary to read book, newspaper and more. Now the many online news sites and stores that can be read online which makes on paper seen redundant. Of course, it is necessary to have actually written documents of stories; if people do tend solely on the internet to provide them with this information, they could become somewhere illiterate, and if the time comes when they cannot use the internet, they @MONTH1 not know what to do. In addition, internet reading could put many business out of business. Publishment companies, news paper (such as yourselve), and paper making industries could be negatively impacted up cause 'of internet dependance. This could the unemployment even more, which is one of its highest points in decades. This makes is recassion. For liberative to stay, which @MONTH1 different when it is competion with something popular and well known as internet. As you can see, computers have a completely negative impact or humans of the modern age. Internet usage and depression. I also leading cause of in children and adults. Finally, it is making unnecessary for people to read books and newspaper so much, which is making people,more illiterate and could cause unemployment. If a person has too make the decision with friend to a movie or sporty event or even to dinner. I strongly use them to go instead of, the computer because in the modern day, this is all a "busy" person @MONTH1 be doing."	2245	
2246	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, more and more people use their computers. Some experts are against this, but I am not one who agrees. Computers are good for all kinds of things. They teach hand-eye coodination, as well as giving people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly, they allow a person to communicate with their friends online. Computers aren't killing society, their helping to form a more advanced world! Did you know that using a computer can teach an important life long skill? This technique is known as hand-eye coordinatio n. People use this skill in their jobs every day, and it even helps them get better ones! It's truly amazing how many jobs require you to have hand-eye coordination, and even more so how many jabs have to do with computers. Computers can and will help you suceed in life. There are many exciting places in the world, and there is a simple way to acsess them all. The computer is the key! Yes, thats a place that you have never been. This can help with reports for school, and even give you directions to the place. Isn't that amazing? Many people have lots of friends who they can't always visit or talk to on the phone. So, to make up for this, the computer allows you to chat with them online. It's really easy and fun to do. It doesn't mean that we are going up spend all put time on the computer. So we don't need to worry. In conclusion, computers are not bad. They help to communicate, learn about faraway places, and teach hand-eye coordinatio n. Computers are not wrecking people, theyre saving them. Thats why its important to keep them around. So please, before you say: ""@CAPS2"" And log off for good, think about how important computers are to the fast moving world thats forming right before your very face."	2246	
2247	1	What is your opinion about computers. Mine opinion about computers is yes I do think to much people sprend more time on computers. Some people don'@CAPS1 get there chorces done because they always on the computer then when there parents come home they get on punisment. I think thats why students don'@CAPS1 do there homework because the be playing video games on the computer. Once you get on its like you can'@CAPS1 log off its like watching @CAPS1.V but you on the computer. However people have chorces to do when they come home from school they say well well mine parents an'@CAPS1 home I could do what ever I want to do then when there parents do comes home they wonder why they get on punishment because they didn'@CAPS1 do what there parents said. Its good being a parent to teach there child from right to wrong. Certainly when the teacher ask us for our homework most students say oh I don'@CAPS1 know I didn'@CAPS1 feel like doing my homework and the teacher ask why? because I was either hanging out with my friends or on the computer or playing video games all day. That why students get the grades they get because they not focus on school. It's best to used the computer fo school projects too not just video games. The only good time that its good to go on the computer is when you ask your parents to go on and you did everything that you were suppose to do. Its best to go on lot a on the weekeneds because many people be on thats more of your friends you could talk to. When you get on it's hard to log off because you get amazed by all the things you can look at on the computer. Its like watching @CAPS1.V you be focus more. I want the local newspaper to agree with my prompt because my reasons are good reasons. You don'@CAPS1 do your chorces you get in trouble. Most people don'@CAPS1 do there homework they focus on video games. Ask before you go on the computer and then everything will be fine.	2247	
2248	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a debate whether the advancement in computer technology is a good or bad thing. Some experts believe that people don't excercise, spend time with their famalies, or enjoy nature due to computers. However, I believe that the advances in computer sciences are very much needed. I believe there are three reasons why we should support advances in computers, the first reason is simple in the buisnesses they always need better technology. The second reason is that computers are slowly replacing a lot of things. The last reason is we need to keep up with the other countries. I believe that the businesses will always need the next new program at application. A perfect example of this would be the @ORGANIZATION3 telecommunications systems this applications helps businesses that are global, talk to their different branches without sending a representative to all the branches around the world. Another key program that is always going to be needed is power point, I'm sure @CAPS2 would quite embarrasing to use @ORGANIZATION2 windows @NUM1 to pitch your ideas to a corporate sponsor, who has had an upgrade for quite some time. I think that computers are also beginning to replace many popular recreational tools of the past for example, look at television you can now go to websites that display your favorite television show sometimes commercial free. I know also that the trend of buying @CAPS3's is slowly starting to decline, with the @DATE1 invention of @ORGANIZATION4's @CAPS4 on @NUM2 player with the ability to hold more than @NUM3 songs! The @CAPS4 surely beat @CAPS3 players, along with the @CAPS4 came @CAPS5 an application where you can buy and dowload songs, movies and games, with prices ranging from @MONEY2 - @MONEY1. My last reason of why the advancement of computers is positive is because the government needs to keep up with the other countries. If the @LOCATION1 were to not have the technology that could comprehend enemy intel, then our counter @ORGANIZATION1 would not make enough important progress to keep our nation safe. Another reason is that without certain robotics many people would have to live with fake arms, and or other body parts. I conclude this letter by saying to consider the major buisnesses who can't afford to send a represenitive, or how you can watch tv programs on the internet for free, and the updates needed to keep a."	2248	
2249	1	"I think that kill are on the computer too much and exersizing to lee. When you do this your muscles will tighten, you will get out of shape, nad your @CAPS3 will grow weak. If these things happen you must likly will feel horrible. You will get out of shape because you will not be moving at all. Also you are just setting in room next to a computer. Finally when you do actually do move if will hurt because you have no muscle flex. Just sitting in the room all day you muscles will tighten from not moving at all. Also you will have no exersize for the muscle to get. The muscle will weaken from no muscle flex. ""muscleflex is one on the most important uses of the "" says @ORGANIZATION1. Finally your @CAPS3 will grow weak with no exercise for the body. also no cardio is bad for the cardiovascular . Letting your @CAPS3 growweak is a very bad habbit ad grow into at a young age. Statistics show that @NUM1 of kids in the @LOCATION1 dont have enough exersize. This letters to this paper @LOCATION1 that too much do time is bad because you get out of shape your muscle will tighten and your @CAPS3 will grow weak. Would you want your @CAPS1/@CAPS2's @CAPS3 to weaken?"	2249	
2250	1	"To the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1: I think that computers have a positive effect on people and it is an advance in technology. The computer is a new technology that can be very useful for education purposes. Computers can also be used to connect with family and friends, and the computer can have useful games that can help us. The computer definitely has positive effects on people. for school and any other educational purposes, the computer can be very useful for @CAPS2. Computers can help @CAPS2 with their homework or projects with a click of a button. They can research about any topic online and use that information if they don't have time to go to the library. The computer also has @ORGANIZATION2, a program that is often used at home, offices, and even in school. With this program, @CAPS2 can type up their paper and just print to have a neat copy that they can turn in. Teachers also think that the computer can be very useful when it comes in education. In a survey, @PERCENT1 of teachers use the @CAPS1 or any other program on the computer to try and learn a lesson. More and more teachers are discovering educational websites and programs that can help @CAPS2 learn a subject. @CAPS2 also take a liking to that subject when they find that they can interact with the subject online. It can make the subject more enjoyable for the @CAPS2 to learn, and for the teachers to teach. Computers will always be on the aide of education. People can also use the computer to interact with friends and family online. Family you don't see for years can be reconnected with you through video chatting or instant messaging. You can also reconnect with people who live far away. Through websites like @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION3, people can talk to their friends and family more easily. @PERCENT2 of teenagers would rather talk to their friends through the computer than talking to their friends through the telephone. It is more enjoyable to see your friend while talking to them if you are videochatting. That is what you can use the webcam for. many people have the webcam and they use it for connecting with friends and family. It is a great way to be social and branch out to your peers. You can also use the @CAPS1 to meet new people and learn about others who you have never met before. Computers are a great way to connect with friends and family and be social. Computers can also be very useful for @CAPS4, groups, and committees that are trying to reach out to the other people. As the @ORGANIZATION1, a widely known newspaper I'm sure you have a website that readers can log onto and learn more about your newspaper @CAPS4 use the @CAPS1 to create websites that can inform buyers, partners, or other people who want to find out more about their business. And through the @CAPS1, they can also advertise their business if they wish. It is very useful and can earn you a lot of money by attracting customers to buy your products. Groups like the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 can use the @CAPS1 to inform citizens of what they are trying to get people to support and to acknowledge the awareness of the importance of that group. They can use the @CAPS1 to gather supporters and expand their group. @CAPS4, groups and committees will use the computer to lure in customers and supporters which will earn them much money. The computer can be useful for many different reasons and it will always be advancing our new technology of the day. Whether used for educational purposes, social purposes, or business purposes, the computer has a positive effect on people."	2250	
2251	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Are computer a good thing for out society? Is'nt it possible that this is @CAPS5 dangerous people can be. Child pornography, fake people using some one elses name. Also, it's a lack of exersise, obesity is increasing alot in the @ORGANIZATION1 due to this technology. What about the other important things in life like your family, your friends. Wont you eventually lost them forever? First, children communicate on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 but do they really know is it's their friends or a sick man playin a joke. I was reading an article about a @NUM1 year old girl who commited suicide, because aof a boy she met on @CAPS3 left her. Her parents in the end found out this was a hoax from their neighbors to see it she was talking about her to other students. Also the internet is full of child pornography because girls want to send it to their boyfriend yet it gets posted every where or landed in to the wrong hands. In this case it's a serious matter so that a negative benift computers have on us human? Next, @CAPS5 many hours do you think a teenagers are addicted to the computer? Do you think they ever exersise? Each year obesity is increasing tremendously. It's not only junk food we eat but since we never exersise due to lack of good nuitrtion or for always being on the computer. I see people who are always on @CAPS3 who have trouble breathing for walking a bright of stars. That is very upsetting! Another reason, when was the last time you had a heart to heart conversation with your child. Is he/she to busy conversating with their friends. I learned this from experince my mother and I aren't as close as we used to be because I'm alway on the internet. Now that I try to talk to her she has aswell became too adicted. The last time we had a family dinner was most likely a year a go. It's really said to see others family do the same. What about your friends who don not have a @CAPS3 or @CAPS2 you end up using contact with them even though they never did anything wrong. In conclusion, @CAPS9 not saying technology is bad but it has it's negative parts. The technology isn't safe anymore. It has become a dangerous place for us teens or adults. The lack of exersise because you are to addicted to the computer hastly losing touch with your family not spending times with them. What about your friends are you going to abbandon them when they don't deserve it. think about that."	2251	
2252	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON2, @CAPS2 a world over run by people who cannot drive, walk, talk or do simple tasks like that all because of bad hand-eye coordination. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about far away people and places, and give people the opportunity to interact with others. We should have computers. First, computers improve peoples hand-eye coordination. @PERSON1 a leading brain doctor, says that computers cut rehabilitation rates of people who suffered from stroke and spinal injuries in half. Also, when children were exposed to computers at an early age they learned to read, write, walk, and talk faster than children who were not exposed to them. In addition, those skills lasted throut their lives, allowing them to learn to drive, and eventually get better jobs. The @ORGANIZATION2 was quoted saying, “ @CAPS3 skills should be the #@NUM1 priority for a good education.” @CAPS4, people that use computers can learn about far away people and places without actually being there. In a recent study, children ages @NUM2 scored @PERCENT1 more on average when using computer compared with traditional learning methods. Not all people have access to books and need computers to get a good education. It also improves when they used computer, and it’s a fact that kids got into better coledges with the help of computers. Don’t you want people to be smarter @PERSON2. Last, @CAPS5 people in remote areas only way of communications is through computers. In a poll done by the @ORGANIZATION1 it proved that people in desolat places communicated through computers. In adition, you do not need to be with that person to talk to them so it is a major advantage for long distance relationships. I know that without computers, I would never be able to stay in touch with my best friend that moved to @LOCATION1. Picture a world where there is never any car accidents, your children can walk at the age of @NUM3 months old, and everybody is never tripping over their own feet. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about things that they normally cant, and create @ORGANIZATION2 path ways for communication. So get out there, @CAPS1 @PERSON2, and tell the world to keep computers."	2252	
2253	1	"I think that computers have positve effects on people. My first reason is because it lets you communicate with other people. It helps you do your schoolwork and understand things better. You can also do cool projects and fun stuff. My first reason is because it lets you communicate with other people. If your absent at school and you don't know what the work was you can ask your friends or even your teacher. If you have a friend and he or she moved to another country you can still talk to them with websites like aim or facebook. For example I used to lived in @ORGANIZATION1 and I moved to the @LOCATION1, but I can still talk to my old friends. You can also communicate with your friends if you want to go outside and play soccer or basketball. My second reason is it helps you do your homework and understand things better. If your teacher told you to find the definition for genre and you don't know what it means you can always websites like google or dictionary. And sometime you need the computer to do your homework, my teacher told me to make a blog about a book after I finished it. Sometimes when your watching a show on television and you don't know what something means you can always look it up. Like one time I was watching @CAPS1 and this kid said ""carly you will rue this day"" I looked up rue and understood what he meant. My third reason is because you can do cool projects and fun stuff. When you are bored you can play games. For example on time it was raining so i couldn't go outside and i went to addicting games.com and played puzzle games all day. When my mom was doing a garage sale she told me to make some adds telling people when and where is the garage sale, so I went in the computer and made the paper more interesting by putting pictures of baseballs, soccerballs and other stuff in it. And you can also lean more stuff with a computer, like how to write a perfect essay, but everything doesn't have to be about school, it can also help you in your future like how to design clothes or houses, or even ride an airplane. So parents @MONTH1 think ""my kids don't want to go outside anymore because their too busy in the computer"". But maybe is the parents fail for that encourage them to go outside and join a sport team. But I think computers have positive effects on kids because it lets them communicate with people that are in other countries. It helps you do your schoolwork and understand things better. And you can do cool projects and fun stuff."	2253	
2254	1	"Dear local newspaper, I believe and strongly suggest that people should use computers, computers have a good effect on people by giving people the ability to learn online and take college courses, allow people to talk online using social networking sites, and gives you the chance to find the local news if you don't have cable. One reason I think computers have a good effect on people is that you can learn a lot on the computer and even take college courses! Online can go onto a search engine and type in something you want to research. And in seconds whatever you typed in, links will pop-up bringing you to what you want to learn about. You can learn about @LOCATION1 and about their history or you can look up about Online, you can take college courses and get a degree even. You can be relaxing at home and can get college credits! Another reason that computers have a good effect on people is that people can talk online, On a social networking site, @CAPS1 facebook, you can look up old friends from high school and reconnect, @CAPS1 if they live in @LOCATION2 and you live an @STATE1 you can chat online and stuff. Its also great if you want to talk to family that live far away. You can have a webcam and then you can actually see them and talk and they can see you! The last reason is that if you heard about something and didn't really know but you can find out that stuff online. Online you can look up local or worldwide news online. If you go on the computer and type in your newspaper and they have a website you can read all about whats happening in your town. So I believe and strongly suggest that people should use computers and that they have a good effect on people. So if you want college credits or learn about places you don't know get a computer and it will have a good effect on you, also."	2254	
2255	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone carees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I strongly disagree. Some people are concerned that people spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Please continue to discover my disagreeing opinions. @PERSON1, professional singer @LOCATION1 ""Spending too much time on the computers is not all that great for you. Why? Well, because computers take more time, and less time exercising and staying healthy. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in the @LOCATION1 get obese from computer attention. You wouldn't want green eyes, and regular size weight gaining more and? I bet you wouldn't want that. Has it ever occured to you, how beautiful nature can be? Imagine nobody outside enjoying the beautiful. Seeing every single kid, even adults. Imagine that! wouldn't you love to have a relaxing day of nature having those laughing having a time outdoors and your child getting exercise at the same time! Not only that but having computers is a waste of time! @PERCENT1 of families across the nation have family issues only because of computers! I remember one time when my brother got this new computer game called @CAPS1.O.@CAPS1 (@CAPS2 of @CAPS3) it was a popular computer game. My mom told him to turn it off and do some exercise, they started bicker alot. Things like this can ruin relationship and interaction with your family members. As you can see, computers can cause a bunch of horrible things like the ones I have mentioned in this essay. Wouldn't you want a healthy life for your child? If so, computers do the opposite. If you had to write an essay about computers, would you agree or disagree?"	2255	
2256	1	"What effect do you believe computers have? My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because, first our government runs on computers. Next, we can search the web when ever we need to find new about stuff. Finally, kids can study and do projects online. To begin, I think computers have a positive effect on people because our whole goverment runs on them. Without computers our state could be a disaster! Our government uses them to keep tracks of their files. They use computers to keep important data. Whether its for money, meetings or anything else. We can always count on computers to keep us on tract and organized. Next, computers can help us a lot in this world. Another reason why they are a positive thing is because we can always go online to see important news we need to know. Most people are way to busy to watch t.v., others just watch the news but when you turn on the t.v. Its too late! Well the first thought that comes to peoples minds is the computer. Many parents use them to check for delays on snowy days or other news that @MONTH1 concern them. I know this because it a personal experience! Lastly, computers are a good thing because kids can do projects, study or homework. Without computers kids wouldn't be so advance as they are now. In the internet kids can learn by playing educational games. They can use the computer to find biographies of a person's life far a project or homework. Not only kids can use. It, but also @CAPS1. If a parent wants to finish school they could take online classes. Most people think computers have negative effects on people but there way more positive effect because it more educational and helpful than people think. In conclusion, I think computers are a positve effect on people because of the reasons I listed before. First, our goverment runs on computers. Next, we search the web to find important news. Lastly, kids can use it for educational purposes. For the most part I think computers are very important in this world. Now the question is. Do you think computers are a negative or positive effect on people?"	2256

Books are printed once and millions of copies are made, all the information stays the same. In the world we live in now, new stories and news comes up every minute of our life. You would never find a out of the blue in a news update that happened yesterday. Computers are million of people every day are informed by the internet in a matter of seconds.

But yet again the computer is faster, updated and everyone is on it. As much as books help with learning new words or communication skills, the computer can do the same thing but explain twice as good and there are a lot of different ways to learn what your trying to find than in a book. The computer also allows you to meet other people. It gives you the chance to make a new friend or maybe start a new life. The computer isn't just for learning, and this is why everyone loves it. Now I understanding there are people out there who hack these computers and stalk you, but there's also the option to upload @CAPS1-virus servers to block them from getting at you!

2258	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I have heard talk going around about computers. People are saying they are bad because they take away @CAPS1 much of our lives. I say that isn't true. We do spend a lot of time on computers but that doesn't necacerally mean we are wasting our time. Computers provide us with infinente knoledge. They allow us to talk to our friends and family across the world, and they have allowed human society to take massive leaps in everyday things. First, they provide infinete amounts of knowlegde. Today, you can find just about any thing you want on a computer. An expieriment was conducted last year by a @ORGANIZATION1 proffesor, who @ORGANIZATION1 people and society. Professor @PERSON1 took a pole to see what people did when faced with difficult, everyday questions. He went house to house and risked average people. Over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of them went straight to their computers or laptops to look it up. Another <@PERCENT1@NUM2> took out thier cell phones, went on the internet and looked it up. The last @PERCENT1 said ""I don't know"" and walked away. This adds up to a total of <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of people who use their computers or internet. Is that a large number of people or what? This reminds me about a good friend of mine from a while ago. He got onto the gameshow ""@CAPS1 you wanna be a @CAPS2?"" and was doing pretty well. We went to his @ORGANIZATION3 house to watch it with her. She is a very intelegent woman, but doesn't know every thing. @CAPS4 friend ended up winning @MONEY1 because of a computer. He get stuck on a question and used phone a friend. When he did this, the phone in his @ORGANIZATION3 house started ringing. I hadn't even celized it but she was already up and at the computer  it up. She found it in less than @NUM4 seconds, gave him the answer, and won him @MONEY2. What would've happened if she didn't have that computer? They would've gotten nothing. You see, publishing if it weren't for that computer, even for that one website, he would have sot. This website is called, ""@CAPS3"". @CAPS3 is the #@NUM5 most used website. I provides countless websites and information for just about anything. Isn't that helpful? @CAPS4 second reason involves family and friends. Websites susch as yahoo and facebook, allow you to instant messages from across the world. Others like @ORGANIZATION4 allow you to web chat with someone, you can see them on the computer monitor and hear them too. For example, @CAPS4 mon works for a company called ganz. She is constatnly traveling places. Even now, as im writing this, she is on a plane flying to @LOCATION6, @LOCATION1. She also goes to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3,  places in @LOCATION4, and to @LOCATION5 as well. Most of these trips last only a week or @CAPS1, except for @LOCATION5. She goes to @LOCATION5 @NUM6 out of @NUM7 months every year. She misses @DATE2, and @DATE1. @DATE1 is the worst for me. Not only does she miss halloween, but she misses @CAPS4 birthday. I am @NUM8 right now and the last time @CAPS4 mother was home for @CAPS4 birthday was when I was @NUM9. I can't take it but on @CAPS4 birthday she sets aside two times to talk to me on @ORGANIZATION4. @ORGANIZATION2, if you take away computers you take away the only chance for me to talk to @CAPS4 mother for weeks at a time. @CAPS4 last reason is about computers and the advances they help us make."	2258	
2259	1	"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever been playing a game to the point where you want to hurt other people? Or even to the point your family thinks your out of the country? Many people depend on the computer too much either for entertainment or to get their feelings out. But the more you spend on the computer the more you are forgeting about your family and that you need to stay calm around other people. Not only to you become more independent and agressive and the lack of exercising adds weight to your body. When people use the computer it is because they have nothing to do. So instead going for a walk they just sit there talking or playing with other people online. This makes the person more agressive towards other people. Also this time of time with your mother or father. This time spend with your family could help you with self extreme, social skills, and politeness. People all around the world are fat because of poor diet and no exercising. When you are on the computer this makes you want food fast. Most people would eat a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a fast meal which adds more than enough calories to that persons diet. On the computer you dont know who would want to talk to some miles and miles away. That person could be a who out of prison. You dont know if they know who you are and where you live. So if they you, you dont know what to do call the police. Also many people can hack your computer and steal your personal files and pictures. This can show the person were you live or even what your doing on the computer. Many deaths have been online because people one who is sensitive. On @CAPS3 you can put things on peoples and see who talk to. That's just like and @CAPS4."	2259	
2260	1	"I certainly think that computers are a positive thing, @PERCENT1 of americans have atleast one in their household. The computer is an excellent source of knowledge, a good place for socializing and also an easy way to research and do projects. First of all, the computer can make you smarter. You can learn things you never knew before. You can learn about things all over the world. The internet also gives us important facts they no where else can. The computer is definitly an excellent way to be informed about lots. Secondly, the internet is a great way for socializing. If you could not talk to relitives in another country on a telephone, you could chat with them lots of teenagers that are trying to make plans go on the internet to chat with close friends. Isually go on facebook when I need to talk with someone that dosn't hve a cell phone either. It is so easy. Lastly, the computer is an amazing way to do on projects for or even work. You can research any topic you want and get the race about it. Next time you need to get the facts, just go on the internet and google it. I'm sure you will find a lot on it. The internet has almost anything you need. I definitly think that is amazing. As you can see, the computer has a lot of wonderful, useful things. It can teach you important things, it is great for social networking and it is also an amazing place for researching topics you wish you knew more about. It is great to have a computer. If you are afraid to either get a computer or not, I am telling you to get one! Go out and learn more about them. There are certainly, positive aspects for having a computer in your life."	2260	
2261	1	"I believe that computers do come in many at times but people should spend less time on them for many reasons such as being fit and healthy being secure and safe and exploring the beautiful world we live in. The reason why I believe that computers have a negative affect an being fit and healthy is because one of my mathers friends pretty much spent three years wasting her time on the internet and gained over @NUM1 pounds. Another reason is because when your on the computer, you soon to get hungry of course so what do you do., snack on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The reason why I beleive the internet isn't always safe is because I went an a chatroom called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" and when I logged in I @CAPS6 in the main chat that people were hooking up and trying to find where one and another live, but thats not even the worst part, one of @MONTH1 friends went on a chatroom and my friend talked to this guy who was @NUM2 and she was @NUM3, anyways she talked to him about every other day far about a year and she finally decided to trust him and give him some of her private information such as where she lives and what not. He found out pretty much everything about her and the next time they talked he called her inapropiate names and told her he was going to kill her, plus, he doesn't live very far, he lives in @LOCATION1. Lastbut not least the reason why it's important to explore the outdoors is because nobody wants a lonely life and if you sit down at the computer all day it's bound to happen. Also you need to explore this world because you only have one life and your wasting it on flash games, @CAPS7, @CAPS8 or some other websites. Alright you guys, you could go on the computer just not for long, that keyboard and monitor are on addiction! And you could be fit and healthy, secured and safe and explore this beautiful world we live in, now isnt that exhilarating?"	2261	
2262	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I had to support on people using ccmputers to people going out and getting the exercise. It would be people getting the exercise in this prompt im going to be explaning why I agree on people getting out instead of people going on the computer. One is that computers are making the postal services go bankrupt more and more people are getting obese and lastly kids are going on the wrong websites and meeting up with people. More and more people are getting computers and using them daily to pay bills, shop online, ect and this is making the postal services go bankrupt. The postal services arnt getting any mail to sent out so there not getting payed. Also when you buy things online it goes to fedex or ups so the postal sevices dosnt get any mail or packages to send or it. I think people are getting to lazy and doing everything on computers and thats not good for buisneses. More and more family are getting obese. Computers are ruinning and messing up familys lives without them noticing. Computers are throwing off a steady exercise plan for the family like going for a walk going to the park and many other things. Familys nutrition is getting ruined and messed up lik instead of having breakfast lunch and dinner they grab a hag of chips and fast off that. Teenagers are getting hurt, raped, and sexually nelested. I think some teenagers boy or girl dont no how powerful the internet is. When a teenager gets a message and they dont no who it is they look at the picture to see @CAPS3 its a cute girl or a cute boy they start talking to them. What some teenagers dont no is that they can put a fake picture on there facebook or myspace and tell them to met up at some location so that they can kidnap you and rape and kill you. Computers are ruining people lives one after another. In this prompt I explained my case on people using computers to people getting out and getting the exercise. I have told you about computers making the postal services go bankrupt, familys getting obese and kids are getting raped and sexually melested."	2262	
2263	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that its true some people do spend more time on their @CAPS3 then they do with ther Family. Their actually not even excercising at and the bad thing they the majority of that people are kids. They spend to much time on their @CAPS3 that they dont excercise at all and because of that their overfat. Many of them get the illness called @CAPS2 wich is realy @CAPS2 makers you have to control your sugar and pressure. Many people think that computers are really good but their not! how I know this? well because computers where made by a human, and humans are not perffect. A @CAPS3 could maybe help student's in school, and for many parents the @CAPS3 is the test solition! Education is very important and so thats why almost every child in the @CAPS4.S of america has one. Computers could help kids with their @CAPS5 it could help kids that work with their jobs. it could even help parents with their bussines. People who support the advances of technology believe that computers have a good positive effect on people but in the other hand people dont even eat in a whole day just to be on a @CAPS3, @CAPS6 my sister I really hate when I cooke and she dont even says she's there. It gets me aggrevated when I see little kids overfat because stil they do is sit around and use a @CAPS3. I think parents shouldnt let their childs use a @CAPS3 a whole day. Many jobs requine a @CAPS3. Just @CAPS6 a schol does. or any other business does. and that why I think people should atless exercise @NUM1 days a week, so that their bodies will stay healthy and strong."	2263	
2264	1	Dear local newspaper people In my opinion I think that people should get off there computers and go spend time hanging out with their friends and exercising. Also to play with their pets too. First I will provide facts on how you need to hang out with you friend instead of being on the computer because a computer does not tell anything about your friend. Also you don't see your friend. You can't tell your friend about your own problems because you can get hacked. Second you need exersize because your body need to be healthy. You could also suffer health problems if you are always on the computer like develope bad eyesite or become obese and can't workout. Third is that your pet needs attion to you just can't buy one and then leave it alone for the rest of his life. Your pet need as much loveing as much time you spend on your computer. If you do not spend as much time with your pet as you do with your computer then the pet will abanden you.	2264	
2265	1	"Dear newspaper, I think that computers do benefit the society. They are very educational. Its another way to communicate with people and make new friends. They also help with exercising and enjoying nature. Computers benefit society in different many ways. To start, computers are educational. There are websites you can go to to look up history or how to do a science experiment. Also, if your mom or dad is at work and can't take you to a tutor there is online tutoring for all ages. Not to mention it teaches you hand and eye coordination. It also helps you learn about the world around you faster for instance, if a building were to fall or something it would be online almost right after it happened. These are reasons why computers are educational. Also, computers are another way to communicate with people and make new friends. For example, e-mail, if you're trying to reach someone and they'renot anwsering their phone or their text messages or their pager e-mail is another and resource. As soon as you send it, it's there, you don't need bars or signals if you've got internet you can send an e-mail to anyone in less than @NUM1 minutes! If you have a website, you can post things on your website, that helps you communicate with anyone who sees that website. Speaking of websites, there are websites like ""facebook"" where you can make new friends and meet new people. Therefore computers are good communication for people everywhere. Computers help you with activities and enjoying nature. For instance, if you want to go on a hike you can look & what type on or . This helps you stay safe on a hike or if you're camping if you're looking for a gym so you can exercise a computer is a great resource for that as well. Or if you're looking for directions to a certain park or a certain soccer feild a computer can most defenitely help you with that this way you're not late for a soccer game or meeting your friend for a pic-nic in the park. A computer is a big help when it comes to nature, exercising or doing fun activities. In conclusion, computers are a great benefit to society. They are very educational. They're another way to communicate and make friends. Plus they help you enjoy nature and exercise saftely and more effecient. These are big effects that computers have on people."	2265	
2266	1	"Dear Local Newspaper. I am writing you this letter to inform you of reasons that computers have a positive effect on people. From kids in school using them to collage students, people use them everyday; for work to just learning in everyday life computers are giving off a positive effect on people. When you pick up your kinder gardener or @NUM1 grader from school you ask them what did you do/learn today. and on most days @NUM2 out of @NUM3 kids say the did something relating to a computer. Some of them say they played a game about adding or subtracting or maybe they are starting to learn how to type. Your @NUM4 and @NUM5 graders said they are typing an essay about @NUM6 or the @CAPS1 on notes they took off of google. But, the big fact is that kids in elementary school all the way to middle school are learning how to use the computer. When they reach high school they have the option to take a class on how to use the computer all the time. Today when you are looking for a job, companies/business usually look for computers background because most jobs require some sort of a computer. If you are a bank teller you use the computer to look up people who need to pay bills or are withdrawing/depositing money into their account. Even a construction worker uses a computer to order supplies or contact a worker. The truth is today @NUM7 out of @NUM8 families use a computer daily. Even when you call @NUM9 they use a computer to find on a map where the accident/emergency is to get there faster. When a mother is at home while the kids are at school and the husband is at work she is usually on the computer. Checking the news, e-mailing her buff's, or her husband at work. Maybe she searching to find the perfect shelter to adopt a dog at in @LOCATION2. When her @NUM10 year old daughter gets home she @CAPS2's her boyfriend on vacation in @LOCATION3. Then she searches on her report about an indian tribe in the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. Their wide family uses the computer daily. So, could you please take this letter into consideration. All ages use the computer for school & work so they would see on your webpage if you respond to my letter. Thank you for reading about how everyone uses computers, for school, jobs, and everyday life!!! Thank you"	2266	
2267	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers is a big divice used to look up different things. You can look up animals, cars, diffrent appliences. A computer gives you anything that you can't find in the stores but most of the time you order and the supplies what your looking for get, sent to you. Also if you don't have a @CAPS2 and you want to see the @CAPS1 your computer gives you a lot of information. Some of the new computers gives you a lot of information. Some of the new computers is a lot of money like , @NUM1, @MONEY1. The things you can do without going on the computer every five minutes. Computers can cause blindness, brain damage, head akes, if your at work on the computer at the hospital checking patcients in or playing games. the lighting on the computer, the words makes your brain or eyes go blury or constintly looking. Also you can catch cramps in your hands by clicking."	2267	
2268	1	"My standing postion on this cause is that computers are good for are technolgy today but if you think that your son or daughter is using today then you can put and block on how long they are on, also it can get comunacation from all arouind the world, and it has the speed of light so you can research stuff and do everythin gyou need to do faster. My first reason is that you can put a block on how long you or your children are on the computer. So if you are one of those pepiole who think that your son or daughter is on the computer to long then you can just put a block on it so they are not on it for more then you want them to be. Also if you think they are on sites they shouldt be then you can put a filter on the intrernet so they cant go on certain things. Also if they are on to long then you can just tell them they cant go on the computer for the rest of the night or sometning like that it is not there fault that pepole lose track of time and what if it is something that needs to be done by tonight and it is a really long thing they have to do or it is for there jobs. Also another one of my reason why computers are more helpful then not is they can let you talk to pepole from all around the world. One is they have chatting sites where you can blog and find new pepole to meet althought there are pepole who do make stuff for the rong purposes nowadays they have moniutours that matchi this things and do reasearch about them once they make a account so if they have done something then they will be closely watched by addminostratiors. Also what if you know someone who moved away and you still want to talk to them you can because of your computer and pepole always say use the phone what if you dont like to talk on the phone or you do like to talk on the phone but at your house you dont get cellphone service there and you cant talk to them because it is staticy so you can use your computer or laptop to chat with them over the web. Or maybe you want to talk to your cousins that moved away and you liked to talk to them a lot but you cant anymore. That is my seconde reason why computers are a good thing. My third reason is that you can search stuff a lot faster threew the computer then you can go threw a book cause a book you have to look for the right book then you have to find a good section of it but on the internet you can just go on a search enginge and you can search right what you need and most of the sites have a description of the site ritght under the web addres so you can see if it what you are looking for. Also what if you ned to have a job paper in tomrrow and you just got it and needs to be about something you dont know about at all you can ask someone over the web to help you and tell you what it is about so you can get it done and keep your job. Maybe in school you need to do a paper for a class and it is a new topic that you have never heard of and you need help witht eht work there are some sites that ave homework help on the wep that you can ask aosmone a question adnt ehy can help you answer it in a short answer or a long one if you need it and they will responde to you either in a little while or right away amnd it is ussaualy right away or in a couple minutes so they can help somone else. Also if you dont belive your computer is runing fast anymore you can just go onto some sites that will inhance your computer speed for no money at all unlike those downloading disk that take forever it is a statistic that for every one disk that someone buy there are @NUM1 pepole who use they intrernet to inhance the speed of your computer so it is 1/@NUM1 of the people who use the internet to inance your internet in minutes instead of those long periods to download instal on the computer that slow disk. That is my third reason why I hitnk that computers are a lot more helpfull then they are'nt."	2268	
2269	1	"@CAPS3 I think about Computers in Society is that, it has great positive effects on People. People can learn things about things in and out of this world. And allows to talk to other people when they need to. Computers could be the best thing that ever happened to us. One @CAPS1 why Computers can be good because its technology can teach people that want to learn about the @CAPS2. Or More, they want to learn about space and planets. Or Learn @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of species are out there. And learn new places for visiting. Another good @CAPS1 is @CAPS5 with other people. Can be d best @CAPS6 you want to talk to. Be part of a good Society @CAPS7. Or @ORGANIZATION1 online with a credit @CAPS8 on a @CAPS9 or Other things like @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS10.

Computers help people find jobs and even find better prices on thing that you would find in a store. Computers also help shy people who won't as socialy active as others have someone to talk to. And lastly computers teach you a lot about things you never even liner about. Computers are a really good way to find jobs. The reason I say this is I remember when my dad didn't have a job for a while and didn't have any luck with the local stores. So one day hes on the computer any happen to stubble upon this really helping website called craigslist.com when he saw how many jobs there were he was a stonished. The next day he went and applied for the job and ended up getting it. Another reason why I say computers benifit our society is online dating. For alot of people it is hard for them to find that special someone. Who know they @MONTH1 be lacking in self confidence of what ever else computers are a good way to look people up they can chat in online chat rooms or even @CAPS3 they want use a web cam. Lastly computers teach you a lot about thing you would never even knew existed for example I remember when I was looking at this animal, and insects site and found out that the daddy long legs is the most deadly spider but they cant bite people only small animals that just amazed me because I hould have never thought that. In conclusion I hope you get why computers benifits our society they can help you @CAPS3 you have problems finding a job. They can also help you @CAPS3 your of lacking in self confidence but still have a companion and lastly they can teach you about thing you never knew about so please see why I believe computers better and benifits our society."	2270

People who have computers usually @CAPS1 work on them for their job or use them to keep in touch with family and friends. They can use them to look things up like look up times for a fight they can check the weather easily. The people that spend most of their time on their computer have been missing out on whats going on in the real world and they are probably not used to runing and get tired easily and they need to exercise and go outside more to get fresh air.

2273	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect of people. I think this because it can help relieve stress socialize, and help eye-cordination. The first reason I think computers have a positive effect on computers is then can help relieve stress. For example after a long day of work at a stressful place you wan't to go home and go on the computer. You can then play games which will relax your mind. The second reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they help socialize. For example say I @NUM1 grade you met someone really special and then you had to move. Well on the internet there are social sites to meet friends you haven't seen in a while. The last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they can your hand-eye cordination skills. This skill can be very useful later in life with many jobs & tasks. Computers help for example by letting you play games that you need to follow and move past. I hope that the writers of this local newspaper use my letter in an article because it has good points that show computers do have a positive effect on people."	2273	
2274	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS1 you enjoy going on the computer? I believe that being on the computer is very useful. First, being on the computer helps teach people hand-eye coordination. Second, the people can learn about different places and people. Lastly, anyone on the computer can talk to friends and family. Please read on to learn more. First and for most, being on the computer helps teach the people learn hand-eye coordination. By typing you need to know where your hands need to go so you well with the computer. This helps in life because if your trying to go and @CAPS1 a sport you need to knw wher your hands and/or feet have to go. Also, when your typing you should know where the keys are. This helps you because when your typing something for your boss or teacher it won't take forever to type it out. Next, you can learn about other places and people. If you were going on a trip you @MONTH1 a little bit about that place. Then you find places you want to visit country. Also, you can one person become famous. You couls use this info to write a work article. Further more talk to your friends and family. Sometimes people can't find specific phone numbers in the phonebook. Instead they could go on facebook, myspace, ect. And talk to them on the website that them to chat. Finally, some people can't hear so they can't talk on the phone. Instead they would be able to send emails back and forth. Can't you see the computer is useful? I teaches us hand-eye coordination. We can learn more about different places and people. Finally, we can keep in contact with friends and family. So it's now or never, should agree or disagree that computers are beneficial?"	2274	
2275	1	"Computers today have taken a toll on society. Using technology advancement has changed the world. Two out of four people are using a computer more then a hour a day.

Computers should be taken down a knoch until we realize how to live with them without computers becomming our life. Young children, teens, and adults have seen effects of technology on love ones or just close friends. The century we are living in has become a new aera for technology advances. We have gotten hooked on not needing to think or use our brains, why would we when we have everything, all the answers two clicks away on google. Individuals don't see theirselves becomming obsessed, always wanting to be chating away on facebook or serching away for answers to homework. @NUM1 years ago they didnt have a easy way to get answers in life or communakate. people that become obsessed cant picture their life without computer games or facebook seights. Men and women turned out fine without computers. They worked hard and become full of knowledge that wasnt just given to them. Computure addiction has gone to such @CAPS1 high level that people forget about nessarities, like @CAPS2 and eating right. Being on twenty four seven notifies the mind to only think about what you want, and thats searching your life away. Computers dont move so the ocupier or the chair wont either you miss out on playing with your dog or jogging on the beach. Spending more and more time on the internet means less time outside and burning caliories that you consume until typing away @CAPS1 you become bigger and bigger the less you care about @CAPS2 and eating the correct way. Computers and deffinetly linked too obisity problems in the @LOCATION1. We all need a reality check on what our main priorities are. The effects of computers are going to demolish the @LOCATION1. Human beings are too dependent on what they believe computers can do for them. people cant have a normal conversation without bringing up computers or sieghts they have visited before. Dont you find it rude when your trying to talk to a friend and they are typing away at their phone that just got internet? I surely do. You cant ask somebody a question without a hold on... What did you just say. Internet is comming everywhere phones portiable laptops. We forget how to act when we talk because of computure slang and just being on. We even have on line dating services that bring people together because they dont meet people, because their on computers all day. We should change how we are evoling before its too late and people don't know how to talk to each other without using slang or having sunglasses with internet screens in side them. Changing our obsession could bring teen and child school grades up, more athlets in the world to compeat in the olimpic and chances for every being to become a better person. The computers advantages that we have @MONTH1 help us in ways now but distroy our @CAPS3, healthy, perspective on the earth. We need to stop becoming dependent."	2275	
2276	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I belive that computers are a help to our society and give us the upper hand on other countries, @CAPS4 example most countries around the world do not have a computer in eviry home our countrie has @NUM1 to @NUM2. Our countrie has a computer in @PERCENT1 of our homes that means we have a well educated populace, computers give insight to far away places that makes people want to travle and that can help our economy. When a middle aged man is on the computer bored, and sees a place like @CAPS5 he plans a trip with a computer, buys tickets with a computer, and then books a hotel with a computer. Those things cost money and the spending boost our economy. We do infact have a problem with obesety in our country but computers can help fix that. The computer game wil is montion inter active making the person dance, jump, play base ball, run a marathon, and many other sports you could also advertise gym memberships on the internet causing people to work out and lose weight. Please help the computer cause by going to this website at your conveinyence www.savethecomputers.org and fill out the free survey to keep computers in our homes."	2276	
2277	1	"Dear @CAPS1 newpaper, @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS2 hve a computer in their houshold. What would it be like if all of them are as it and not with the outside world? Well, studys show that this is one of the main reasons that @CAPS3 are becoming unhealthy. People are concerned that we are spending to much time on the computer and less tme exercise, enjoying with family and friends. Computers are not needed and serve as a tords as @CAPS2. Less time exercising is a problem even without computers. There are so @MONTH1 now adays that a computer is just maky it worse. Likemore, this is a reason why @CAPS2 are going weight. Studies show that @CAPS6 are not exercising becuse @NUM1 mainly web games and computers. Therefore, Computers are something the we can what. Nature is an of the beautis of the world and computers are that away from us. For example: People think that the computer gives them information about nature but really they not for their selves. Make us somethg that not be seen in prison not an a computer. Family and friends is another problem with computers. People get addicted to and as a result, my dad interest with . Also, computers hav eveythg from games to e-mail that could be the for. Although, computers are able to contact friends and family members from across the world, thd wouldnt be the only reasn why they be on the computer. Its time to discide whay computer should be used or not. They as a towards @CAPS7 and part of the rasn why is are so unhalthy. I hope you see my at the"	2277	
2278	1	"Computers have evolved so much in the past twenty years. However, is that a good thing for the average @CAPS1? People using computers twenty four seven is a problem. They: rather use a computer then go outside they start relaying on them too much and people can easly get addicted. This can really have a affect on society when the computer goes sour. In @LOCATION1, the @DATE1 is such a great time. People start going outside more, the weather warms up which means that it is a great time to go outside. However, if people go on the computer constantly, now do you expect for them to be able to enjoy this great @DATE1 weather. The computer caused problems since when someone is about to go outside the computer drogs them in wanting them to use it more. That is when the inosent is droged by the computer, and when they rather use it then go outside. Now a days, so many things can be done on the computer just to avoid the store, as the bills. Computers are used to buy items at stores, pay bills, or even to get those tax refunes in. However, don't you believe that people are relaying on computer too much? How would the owner react if one day they were on the computer and it were to shut down. The person would loose it and not know what to do. They would now know how to take care of the problem. A lot of people use computers no only because they have to, but also for there enjoyment. There enjoyment however, can lead to on addiction which means never leaving the computer. An example is when a student comes home from school and decides to on the computer. Before you know it, the time has gone by and it is nightime with the student sill playing on the computer with homework to be completed. We @MONTH1 take advantage of computers sometimes, however they can cause problems. People would rather use them more they can have people relay on them more, and also people become addicted. These are the affects computers have on people."	2278	
2279	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers do not benefits society. I think people be exercising more. They should also try interacting more with their family and friends, then with their computer. They could also be enjoying nature or helping their environment. So there are a lot of things you could be doing then playing on your computer. My first reason why i think computers do not benefit society is because people spend all their time on the computer that they do get out of the house and exercise. People have more fan on the computer that all they do is sit and eat. They don't do anything else. Then they do usally get unhealthy and gain weight. However, when they exercise they can get healthy. There are a lot of stuff you can do at the gym to get fit. For example, swimming or running. Sometimes in the gym when you do stuff like swimming or running they will have a tv in there. So you could watch tv or listen to your favorite music instead of being a lazy bum and playing on the computer all day long. If you dont like working out alone then you could bring your friend. You guys could play in the pool or play inside tennis. Or if you don't wanna go the gym just go out for a walk. Or go out jogging. There are a bunch of ways to get healthy and have fun, so your not on the computer all day long. Who knows you might just have more fun. So thats why i think exercising is better for you then playing on the computer all day long. My second reason is people could be interacting more with their family and friends then their computer. Somepeople spend so much time on the computer they forget whats going on in real life. For example, what their kids grades are. They could stop playing on the computer and go to the park with their family and friends. Just spending time with eachother would help their relationship with their family. They could learn alot about them. So just spending with you family and friends would be better then they computer. My third reason is instead of being on the computer they could start enjoying natore or help their environment. The environment could use all the help they could get. Animals are dieing because of us. We should stop cutting down their homes. We should rebuild them so stop going on the computers and actually try to help the environment? You could get your friends and family to help you. It would be great bonding but mostly good for the environment. Or you could go for a nice walk in the park and listen to the birds. Eiether way is good for you. So you should just try it. So those are my reasons why people should spend less time on the computers. You could be having more fun exercising. Or maybe you might have more fun interacting with family and friends. You could also try enjoying and repearing nature. There are a bunch of things you could be doing instead of being on the computer."	2279	
2280	1	"Dear news editor, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend at least @NUM1 hours a day on there computer. I belive that computers are taking to much time in our daily lifes when we can be out doing sports, studing for school, or even spending time with our families. Sports are very important to everyone but not everybody do sports, thats what computers are doing. Computers make it hard for some people to go outside and get some fresh air. In the university of @CAPS3 they @CAPS1 a test conducting teenagers and how they spend there day. Its a fact that @PERCENT2 of students would rather go on the computer and chat with there friends instead of going outside a play a sport. This is very hard for teenagers to get out of something they really enjoy doing but sports also make you very fit and healthy. In one day of going outside you burn more calories then sitting at your computer going on facebook or twitter. Lastly sports get you united with other friends, peopld who play more sports usually tend to be more popular then a person that goes online all day. Sports are important for many different reasons like time wise, healthiness and friends but also the computer takes away your study time. Studing for school is very important when you are in your teenager years, school is the thing that gets you a job when your older, or lets you be whatever you want to be when you grow up. In the univirsity of @CAPS4 they conducted an expiriment that going on the computer for more then @NUM1 hours will decrease your grade average by @PERCENT3. Studing is what gets you through highschool then collage. Also when you are on the computer for so long you tend to forget the asignments that you were asighned for schoo. After all that you wont know what your learning about and fail most of your tests. Lastly, when your all done with highschool and you look at your grades and say ""wow, how @CAPS1 i get this"" You will know that all your computer chatting and playing computer games @CAPS1 this to you. What collage would want an @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 students in there univirsity. I wouldn't, studing is very important but one of the most important things in life is your family and spending time with them. Families are the things that unite kids to there parent, causing to there uncles. It makes the whole world happy, you dont want to get ride of that just because you want to go online and chat with your friends. Some kids get seperated from there families and never get to see them again and they would give anything to have there parents in there arms. And there are the people who have parents but don't appericate what they do for them. Do you want to turn out like those people just because of a computer? Computers take the ability of people to do what they want to because of there adicting games and online chats, but there are better things to do like sports, studing or spending time with your family. You can make a change."	2280	
2281	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, I am very concerned about the effects which computers have on society. Computers have been very useful to us since the day it was invented. They have provided accurate and useful information throughout our daily lives. Computers helps us to view things we never knew existed. They help us to learn about cultures and different places, but just as computers serve a good use, they can also be a burden. Computers prevent people from socializing face to face. They prevent peole from getting their work done. Computers also cause an addiction to small children. These reasons account for the problem, that computers have a negative effect on a majority of people. Computers have a negative effect on a majority of people because it prevents them from socializing face to face. Teenagers especially tend to use the computer more than a cell phone or talking to someone face to face. This is because, on the phone they have a limit for how long they can talk or how many people they can talk to. Talking on the phone all night also raises their phone bill so they get in trouble with their parents. So they use the computer which they can use to talk to more than one person, they dont have a limit and they can stay up all night which is not good for their health. So it reinforces my statement saying computer have a negative affect on a majority of people. Computers have a negative affect on a majority of people because it prevents them from getting their work done. Some adults feel as if they do not have to go to the office to work. They can do the work at home on the computer. So eventually they get fired. Teenagers are busy on the computers talking or playing games, that they do not get their work done. The work is not done so they fail school. When they are older they donot have a good job because instead of doing their work, the spent their time on the computer. Computers are useful but they have a negative affect on a majority of people. Computer have a negative affect on a majority of people because it causes addiction. Many people do not pay attention at school because they were thinking about an awsome game they played or the conversation they had. Computers mostly cause an addiction to small children. Children easily get addicted because, while their brain is in a growing process, it implants the idea of going on the computer to play games on a daily basis. They get too use to using the computer that they do not know when to stop. So computers have a negative affect on a majority of people. In conclusion many adults should really think about the examples I have stated, especially parent. Children have to think about the future instead of wasting life on a computer. I am not saying children should not use computers, I am just saying there should be a limit. Don't you agree?"	2281	
2282	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you of the effects of computers and how we benfit from them. I am for computers mostly because mostly because I can keep in touch with friends by using @CAPS3 and other websites. I would much rather use a phone to talk but since everyone always uses the internet and don't bother with a phone it seems to make more sence. Comuters are also very helpful for businesses because they store all their messages about private work and things that need to be worked on like graphs and other important business like problems. Using e-mail is a good way to get news and other fun games and youtube videos. A lot of people pay taxes online now and if you take internet acess away they lose a lot of important information. They might pay their taxes late because of that and if people are used to paying taxes online and all of a sudden they can't and they start doing it with physical paper in front of them, who knows they @MONTH1 have trouble and get very confused. I used the internet for e-mail, @CAPS3, occasionally games, and study @LOCATION1. I think study @LOCATION1 is important for becoming better at certain subjects or lessons. I had to do every study @LOCATION1 in the math section and I did not like it at all doing twenty four tests, but it helped me out with my grade and I'm glad I did it. Also for @ORGANIZATION1 if students have a project clue that involves colorful pictures a computer and colored printer would be very helpful. Also if students have an essay due typing it on microsoft word is a good way for it to be kneet and easily able to read. These were just a few resonds of why computers are good to have and how you can benefit from them."	2282	
2283	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is technology all aroud people every day, wether its a work, home, or out on your phones. About @PERCENT1 of people use computers daily. I believe this could have good, and bad effects on people, but mostly good. Effects, education and money run into each other on this subject and computers in my opinion are great! Moreover, I will begin with @CAPS2 effects. For example, my some really great things could happen on the computer with you and your friends while your on an online website, like facebook. People have the opportunity to meet people from all around the world, the only bad part is you have to absolutly know the person. Most of the time it will be one of your friends. On computers you have a great chance to talk to friends, or family. @CAPS1 are so many ways! Secondly, education is a great topic for this subject sometimes teachers ask students to go online to their website, to eather do homework or to do something online. Other times is to get pictures on @ORGANIZATION1, for kids projects. Like people say, ""everything happens for a reason."" @CAPS1 are many websites on the internet for everyone of all ages to get on to learn something. Some accually have wonderful information that everyone should know. Lastly, food is my last reason why computers are good for us. Well, first of all, everyones heard of weight loss programs on the internet and some really work. Others cost money, and others don't. Thus, talking about adults for this situation internet will be needed greatly sometimes. Another fantastic reason is razors. Some can be online also. And this is an awesome way to get bread, candy, ect. What would you do without the internet doing all these creative things? How about not helping with your work? or what are student and kids going to do when they need to know something? my opinion on the effects computers have on people are important facts to know and think about. Lets pay attention and realize that computers are good for us!"	2283	
2284	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I have been informed that you would like people to write letters of the effects of computers. I think computers have very good effects on people for the most part. In a recent study, @PERCENT1 of kids and adults had a good effect on computers. I think they allow us to learn new things, teach hand-eye coordination and allow us to connect with others. my first reason why I think computers have good efforts is because they allow us to learn new things. Theres so many sites that are appropriate and give valuable information. The older you get the more projects for school you have to do and without a computer it can be very difficult to learn about that certain project. Computers have so many sites and groups that give imformation and just sites that have learning games. My second reason is because they come with another good reason, when your doing all that typing your practicing hand eye coordination. You keep looking back and forth and your actually learning a skill that is very useful to life. Also when your typing your exercising your hands and working your muscles. learning hand eye coordination is good especially for sports; like baseball, tenis, softball, so learning it early can help you become a better sports player. Finally, my last reason is connection on computers. Over the years many of my closest friends have moved, but recently, I have been able to stay in touch with one because of resorting to the computer, now that we can talk we can share pictures and chat. Computers are very useful in that you can stay in touch with friends and family. If you use the sites appriatly you can connect and talk to friends, they allow you to involve yourself in friends lifes. Now adays they have many sites you can use and chat with others. Computers are very useful in that they have many advantages, they have many learning sites, to read and learn new things, they teach hand, eye coordination by typing and looking on the computer, and they allow you to chat or keep in touch with old friends, new ones and family. Its now or never, computers have way more pro's than con's, I think computers have many effects and are a very good invention and are great in everyday lives."	2284	
2285	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers do benefits society because if helps people to learn about places all over the world. People also became more sociable, there is classes online and if you have friends or family members that live for, far away from you, you can keep in contact coith them in many ways! My first reason why computers benefit our society is because it helps people to learn about places all over the word. If you go online you reasearch a name of a place and learn history all about it, this kind of websites also include photos. This information might help you for school work and even for publicity. One time I had a @CAPS1 studies project on china the internet helped me find information about history, religion, holldays, places to tour and spend vacation at. Because of the computer I had all the information I needed and got an A on my project. My second reason why computers beefits our society is because it help people become more so dable, for example if you have friends and family members that live on the other side of the world well guess what? you chat and sometimes spend time with them. When I say spend time with them I mean by webcam. Webcam is a device you connect to your computer and it's like a video camara, you just sit in front of if and watchers what you do. If you want to do this with a person the other person must have a webcam too. You can also chat online with people and send pictures to others through email. I have family members in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 that have computers too and I always communicate online with them and look at pictures of my family though they are not near me. It is really fun and you can't do this without an computer. My third reason why computers benefit our society is because some people don't have enough time to drive back and forth to colleges so, @CAPS4 take online classes. Online classes are just like school and you also pay for education just like any other college. I know this because my cousin graduated from high school but is working very hard to have enough money to buy a car that she can drive back and forth to college. She does not want to waste her fine looking and at home doing anything so she goes on her computer and take online college classes. If it wasn't for a computer she would not be learning and taking her education seriously. So, there you have it. Those are some reasons why I think computers benefit our society. with computers people are more sociable, You get education, You can keep in contact with friends and family members all over the world, no matter where they're at. Computers are very useful!"	2285	
2286	1	"@CAPS1 I just stay up for a couple more hours? I'm really busy and have a lot of homework! @CAPS2 all of the children around the world addicted to the computer. @CAPS5 these days spend about @NUM1 hours on the computer a day! Even though parents hear excuses that their children are working on homework, did you ever think what happens when you walk away? They minimize their essay, research and other homework and start chatting with their friend on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and all of the other hundreds of websites that connect with your friends. As being the local newspaper it is your job to put an end to this computer addiction! It is shown by experts that @CAPS5 need more @CAPS6, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First off, computersdefinitely do not benefit society because of the time it has taken away from peoples lives. Citizens of the world should be outside on the beautiful @DATE1 day, or the first snow of the winter, instead cooped inside their homes @CAPS6 has been locking all around the world and it is coused by our laziness. About @PERCENT1 of the world is overwheight which is @NUM1 out of every @NUM3 people. It is also one of the main reasons of death. Just by turning off the computer, people @CAPS1 enjoy the outdoors, run around with their neighbors, friends, and siblings and actually enjoy it. Why should people waste their time chatting with friends, when you could invite them over and play outside? That means, you are excercising, enjoying nature and having fun all at once! Secondly, computers have a lot of effects towards people because it takes time away from family and friends. In my experience, I would much rather want to go to the park with my family than play games on the computer. It also gives @CAPS5 a chance to interact more with their families which gives them more support. I have had a friend who started failing classes because problems with parents. If she spent less time on the computer and more time with family and friends, things would have been different. Lastly, having @CAPS5 spend less time on the computer, would bring those bills way down, and would a lot of energy. Also, if you really have to speak with your friends that lise far away, there's an invention called a telephone instead of talking for an hour on the computer, pick up the phone and call them. This way, your mom and dad @CAPS1 go on and pay bills or do work! The other reason why computers are unhealthy for society because of pressure in school. Teachers expect you to type essays, look up research. but how come we @CAPS1't hand write it? This way you will save energy and money, and you could always type it at school. For research, you @CAPS1 get a book such as an atlas or an encyclopedia. In conclusion, computers do not need to be in our lives anymore. Being the local newspaper, it is easy to spend the world around to abandoned using computers. This way, people will get more exercise, enjoy nature, spend time with family and friend and save money. As experts say computers @CAPS1 take away a whole year in an average lifetime! Just image...what could you do with an extra year?"	2286	
2287	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much would our daily lives be affected if we didn't use computers? I feel that the use of computers greatly benefits our daily lives. Computers help us in many ways, including keeping in touch with far away friends. They also help alert people of up to the minute news. @CAPS7 you can see, Computers have many positive effects on our society. Have you ever had a friend move far away? Sure you could visit them every once in a while but computers help people keep in touch with one another. I know from experience @CAPS2 easy it is to keep in touch with someone. Using computers, one of my friends moved away last year and I am still constantly talking to her. Because of computers, we can email each other when get the chance and we still remain close friends, Other thing that are helpful computer are social networking sites. These @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 help people to stay in touch with each other. for example, some of my friends still communicate with camp friends through those sites. They even helped them become closer friends. @CAPS7 you can see, Computers make it much easier to communicate with friends that live farther away. This aspect is one of the great benefits of computers on modern society. Another great impact computers have made on society is bringing news to people very quickly. Instead of having to wait for the weather report to come on television in the @TIME1. I just check the computer; @CAPS6 weather reports, computers also have reports or to news stories. @CAPS2 many have you been the news, waiting for and then you over twenty minutes, or wasting your time because the hasn't come on and it is time for you to go? I know that happened frequently to my mother. The problem was solved when I told her to look on the computer. Now, she doesnt waste her time waiting for the story to come on the @LOCATION1, computers also helped us find out about school delays or @CAPS7 you can see computers help people with things they do daily such @CAPS7 checking weather, finding out about top news stories, or hearing about @CAPS8 computers help people They can help to find out about weather or news; to keep in touch with an old friend. I understand the arguments that online communication can never sometimes it is very hard to get to see people in @CAPS9 @CAPS1 would agree that computers have greatly benefit our day to day lives our lives would be much without the use of computers, @CAPS7 you can see computers better our lives on a @CAPS10 of ways."	2287	
2288	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The computer is perhaps, on of the most enterprising inventions. They broaden horizons for children eager to learn and make communication much more sufficient. Furthermore, computers encourage the development in had eye coordination for people of all ages. Withought adoubt, computers are not only a major attribute to the successes of people all around the world, they are the solution, and they will and should forever be part of our growing culture. It is important to note that computers provide a learning environment, for children and adults, teenagers and grandparents. Before the invention of computers, to write a paper, one would need to goto the library. Now, right in your own home, you can access trillions of website for more information than a library could every provide. Additionally, computers enable people to learn and understand culture goverments and people around the world. Whether you want to learn about religion, or the rules of soccer, the internet is your gate to new discoveries. It is also important to note, by having access to computer people will be able to learn about you, and perhaps be introduced to your product. People can now read books on line and they can learn different languages. The possibilities are endless. As I mentioned, computers even allow people to talk online with other people. Facebook, twitter, instant message, and email are allways to communicate with friends co-workers or family. More recently, computers now are capable of showing alive feed from person to person . This enables people to not only talk but virtually be with that person. Also, computers are home to many software programs in which you can meet perhaps the love of your life. Onsight such as eharmony, you can communicate with people who share similar intrests as you make a bond to last a lifetime. Equally as important, computers encourage the development of fine motorskills. Obviously, typing is a challenging process for many that requires practice, building up hand eye cooordination. By typing you strengthen your fingers and increase your endurance. On the otherhand , some educational computer games also build up hand eye coordination for people of all ages. Although some critics say that computers take the place of interacting with family and friends, it is evident that computers incourage communication with relatives and people around the world, via eharmony or facebook. As a whole, computers are positive to our growing and enterprising culture. the time has come to tell the world really how vital they are to everyone. They provide an adequete place for learning for people of all ages and enable people to communicate with others more quickly and easily. The development of computers also help to build the strength of fingers, and also hand eye-coordination, Are you going to surpass this chance we have for great success? Everyone knows that computers @MONTH1 be a distraction but the are what best for our future. They play a big role in the development and success of our society."	2288	
2289	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you love it when a new advanced technology system comes out for your new laptop? @CAPS1't you love having the best and fastest computer? Well computer are a great resource for learning. With the power of the internet you can learn about places all around the world with the click of a button. Maybe people are using computers too much and are not getting the only exercise they need but really, computers are a very reliable resource to learn from. Computers help many people in many different ways. You can explore different parts of the world in a computer you can also learn a new language on a computer Computers are so high and these days that you can practically learn anything you want off of a computer. Having computers in school makes it even easier to learn because they are musch faster than turning pages through a five hundred paged text book. Technology these days can truly change peoples lives there love, having computers is a good thing. If you ever need to tell your friend something but they are on the other side of the world, you can send them an e-mail. This helps many people reach others much faster. Also, you can instant message a friend if he or she is online, it is much faster than using your phone. This saves a lot of time for people and also helps them remember things. Computers can change people lives forever, computers can help you meet new people and also make you wait to create a computer of your own. Overall, computers can change peoples lives and make people much more aware of what is going on in the world. Although computers are quite amazing things, unfortunately they do take away a lot of time from your normal life. Parents often put a limit on computer use if you are on the computer too often or if you can't seem to get off with the technology these days, you can't seem to get off at the electronics. Computers are very fun to use daily but try not to get lost in the world of computers. The main time computers take away from a persons life is exercise time. If you do not play a sport, then it is even harder to get off of the chair and go exercise for at least thirty minutes. This is one of the things that are causing people to be more overweight than usual. Although computers are great, they are adictive and can change your life for the worse. In the end, computers are an advanced technology that make peoples lives much easier. But, they can change your lives for the worse. In the end, computers are an advances technology that make people lives much easier. But, they can change your lives for the worse depending on how you use it. Computers are a great way to learn and eventualy are going to change the world, hopefully for the good and not the bad."	2289	
2290	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 out of ten people use computers every day. That’s why I strongly agree with this satement: That people are spending to much time on the computer. One, people aren't interacting with family and friends, people are obessed about computer and people getting overweight. On many laptops and computer there are @CAPS2 (you can buy them in the stores too.) @CAPS2 are fun loot, however instead of walking to your friends house you just type with them. Interacting with family and friends face to face not with a computer in between is better. For example, @PERSON2 has a webcam on her computer and she talks with @PERSON1. Who @PERSON2 could just walk down the street to talk too. Do you notice your kids not interacting with you, newspaper readers? When you walk by your kids computer do you see them switching the. The page that they don't let you see is, @CAPS3 or myspace. People are getting @CAPS3 or land myspace accounts when they are as young as @NUM1 years old. For example, when @PERSON2 got a @CAPS3 I would see her on. Therefore she is addicted to the computer. When I was over her house, readers, she would always be on the computer. Now I never go over her house because thats all she would do. People are getting addicted to social networking on the computers. Have you, local newspaper, notice after you made an account on the computer you gained some weight? I have notice my friend @PERSON2 has. When you came home from work or school you find you selve getting chips and the computer? I even sometimes do that but not everyday. Moreover people rather go on the computer than go for a sun. No wonder why they call @CAPS6 one of the fatest countries. As you can see, Readers, computers are taking over our lifes. People aren't being socail without a computer, adults and kids cure getting obessed with computers. Moreover, people are getting over weight and not exercising. Americans, we need to a stop to these."	2290	
2291	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the amount of time people spend using the computer is just fine. I think this because even though people do use the computer, it is a great way to learn about faraway places and their cultures. It also teaches hand-eye coordination and allows people to talk online with each other. In this every, I will explain the benefits of using computers. The first benefits, as I about is that the computer will allow people to learn about faraway places and other cultures. @CAPS1 example, if I wanted to learn about @LOCATION1, I could just type up the word @LOCATION1 on google, and link to at things. Which opposes to having to find a book or even going to the library just to find one book on it. And did you know that @PERCENT1 of all computer technicians @CAPS2 that it is quicker to look things up on the internet then look things up in a book? that is @CAPS3 first reason. @CAPS3 second reason is hand-eye coordination. This would help in sports, @CAPS1 example, if you are playing football, you would be able to track where are ball is going and catch it than someone who doesn't use the computer as much. Hand -eye coordination also helps because in you get into you are able to throw and block punches quicker. Keep reading on to see @CAPS3 third and find argument. @CAPS3 third and final reason is that you are able to talk with people all across the world. @CAPS1 example, @CAPS2 you have an who has to go to @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 a year. You would be able to talk to her using @ORGANIZATION1 or video chat. That way you can keep in touch with loved ones even they are away. So @CAPS3 there reason why computers are good is because you are able to learn about far away places and cultures, @CAPS3 second reason is that using a computers can hand-eye coordination. And @CAPS3 third and final reason is that you are able to talk to loved ones even though they @MONTH1 be far away. So I think computers should be to be used as much as they do today."	2291	
2292	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I want to explain how computers affects people lives, one is that it can give your important information, two you can out an more important things in life, and three you can learn about different culture and languages. My first reason why I want to explain how computer affects people. You can learn important information for instins you can look up a biography for a writing test or thing you just want to be aware of, you are intrest in. My second reason is you can out on more important things in life like family and communicating with them & having fun go outside for some fresh air once in a while and stop playing video games on the computer. My third reason why computers can affect a person life is that you can learn different cultures and language like getting information on your ancestors and how they live their lifes and what are their traditions, languages because if you want a specific job that requires a certain language you can search website that can teach you. I choose the three reasons because their are times when you can look information up and other times when you spend quality time with family and friends, and last look up your past lives like your ancestors."	2292	
2293	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you know over @NUM1 million people use a computer? The reason why people use computers is for a few reasons. Weather it is their @CAPS4, hobby, or their buisness. The computer is a fascinating piece of technology. But Other people believe computers can ruin lifes. Or make people @CAPS5-@CAPS6. So the question everyone is asking is @CAPS7 computers be used as much as they are. Almost every one in @LOCATION1 has a computer. But many people who love new gaddets and technology somtimes forget that health comes first. @CAPS3 you know that @LOCATION1 is one of the least healthy countries on the earth? @ORGANIZATION1 says that computers are an active contributer to americas bad health. Computers were originaly made to make everyday tasks easier. But in my opinion it makes it harder because people are always glued to their computer. What are computers really used for today? The first thing people think of when they hear the word computer is internet. The internet is the main reason people are so glued to their computer. This is because people can always find some kind of new website. Their are billions of websites now its not even funny. The internet is probably the main cause of kids wanting to stay inside instead of exploring and having fun outside. If you are a parent do you want the best for your child? If so you @CAPS7 tell them all the basic necesities that a human needs in order to survive. For example tell them they need exersize, healthy foods, clean water, and shelter. Also tell them about when you were a child and might not have had a computer. This could be a huge step toward in our countries/world health. Not only for the world but also for all your friends and family. So now its time to decide the fate of @LOCATION1. @CAPS7 we be idolized or be shuned upon. I think the decision is clear. So if you really want to start making people of all ages become better people what you can do. If you go to your friends/family and tell them they are on the computer to much they will listen to you if they care about you. If every one in the world does this we might just fix all bud things having to do with this generation."	2293	
2294	1	"Dear @CAPS1 post, I think computers have a good effect on people and thier safty. Computers are a wounderful technology to have, espechaly with a wed cam. Computers are also easyer for school projects. Last but not least, computers are used in our military to keep us safe. Putting a web cam on a computer is an exanlant idea. A douter and son can see his or her dad thats been away on a busisness trip for mounthys or maybe evan years. An example in my life that a web cam came in handy was when my friend had a forien exchanged student from @LOCATION1 come to his house for a year. He was able to talk to his parents anytime he wanted to. He also got to introduce his parents to the people he was living with. Computers are a easy to look up information for school. For example, I forgot to read a book and do a project on, but I forgot to read the book and the project was do in @NUM1 days. What do I do? You can google a summary of the book and all you need to know is right thier. Computers are also good for making your work neeter, and you can print pictures and use that for your work. Computer make the military more safe. Insted of putting solders on the frount line you can have them controll a @ORGANIZATION1 preditor. A @ORGANIZATION1 preditor is a computer controlled plane shoots a computer controlled missilels were our enemys are hiding. Computers lets us know if there is an enemy country trying to invade our country, and about @PERCENT1 of our military and army are made up of computers. Computers are a big important technology in our country. Ya maybe kids are playing computer games then getting exsersize. Computer games slow up the computer anyway, and parent have to put a limmit to the games to. So my three reasons; talking to family, school work, and military and army benifits. State why I think computers are good not bad for our country in the @LOCATION2 And I hope you think the same way."	2294	
2295	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you were around the age of @NUM1 did you have a computer? Or did you have to go to the library to use the computer? Computers have an effect on people both in a positive and negative. Personally, I think computers help with learning and interacting with people. But, there are people that disagree, with me, and think computers can cause health problems. The issue is, are computers good or bad for people. Read on to see why think computers have a good effect on people. School is one of those places where in can be fun but also can be boring. Learning has to do a lot with our future. Computers make it very easy for us. My school books are very heavy, and big. Sometimes if I have a lot of homework I don't take them home. Instead, I will go on the computer and research my topic. Now and days we rely on computers a lot. ""@CAPS1 teachers need worksheets they will go on the computer and print something out."" @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1. So you see it is not only me that thinks computers help with school. We also do projects on them. Growing up did you have a lot of friends or were you the person in the corner. Today, there are so many chatrooms. For example, @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @LOCATION1, etc. You can go on these and interact with other people. Facebook and @CAPS4 let you and friends. You can talk to them and @CAPS1 you go to school you will have something to talk to them about. The computer lets you join chat rooms in which you will meet new people. You can talk to someone across the world too. My cousin has a computer pal. A computer pal is @CAPS1 you are a type of older brother or sister to somebody. This person is across the world from you.. You don't see them in person. The computer can teach you how not to be shy and helps you interact with new people. You've heard the up side of computers but now its time for you to hear the down side. Many people belive computers can cause health problems. Computers also lets you play games. Which can cause lazziness. I was watching @CAPS5. They were talking about kids that use the computer for @NUM2 hours playing games. Now they play proffinal computer games. Those people @CAPS3 they have depression so games make them feel better. All the people on the show wear glass. Most of the people were fat. They stop exercising because they don't want to stop playing their game. Would you want your kids to damage their health. The time has come. It's now or never. What is your opinion? What time of effect to computers have. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect. Computers are a good way to interact with people. Studies show over @PERCENT1 say it helps with learning. Or are you against my opinion? Computers can cause lazziness and serious health problems. Your child can become overweight by not getting exercise."	2295	
2296	1	"Did you think the computers are necessary for us? Many people think the is not necessary have a computer in the house, but other people think the is necessary have a computer in the house. Three reasons, first some kids have home work to do they need to find information or pictures. Second the people need to do work like type a information for the work. Last if we don't have computers we can communicate with - they family of other contry. Sometimes the teachers give homework to find information for a home work. The teachers say the somtimes we need the information for class work if they don't finish they can find the information agen so the kids need a computer. Sometimes the kids whant to have a picture for paint or draw. In a fabric need informetion for how many the workers are mead of fabric. They need to type the informetion for too know how many they need to pay to the workers. They need to type a letter for others persons. Persons like us have familys in other countries. Sometime they whant to talk but they don't have cellphone or a phone. They use the webcam to talk for the webcam can see aech others. The conclushion is the people need a computer for a good no bad. I think this speech work in something to you. Thanks you."	2296	
2297	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I think, this whole idea with us people being on the computer too much is kind of dumb. Being on the computer way too long can blind you. If, you choose to start to spend more time with the computer more than you spend time with your family and friends they'll probably start noticing it. lastly, that also can make you gain weight. Being on the computer can make you loose your eyesight because, basicly its like your looking at a light for atleast three or more hours and usually when your looking at a light or something bright you start to loose your eyesight. It doesn't help you at all. Especially, if you already wear glasses and have horrible eyesight. Another thing is that a lot of others start to use the computer more than they spend time with there loved ones. I think thats pretty bad if your starting to forget about your own family and friends. the people that care about you, because that can turn into something really bad. They start to think that your trying to avoid one another. That's not to good for anyone. Also, when you sit on the computer for a long time and eat and play or read whatever's on the screen. That's basicly gaining weight. Your eating and not even working it off. That's real bad for your health too! I, rather us eat then exercise. I, hope you took my opinions into consideration, and you use them in a positive way! Thank you for listening."	2297	
2298	1	"Computers can be really useful if you know how to use them. Instead of sacrificing your social life for your computer, you can use it to improve your social life. You can use social networking websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 to communicate with your friends and family instantly. You can even download instant messengers to instantly send text messages to your friends or familys' computers. Also, without research people wouldn't live as easily and possibly less healthier if they use the internet to consult online health experts regarding their health. Some people @MONTH1 over-use their computers and ignore socializing which is not good nor is it healthy. But instead of paying attention to the negative effects of computers, we should recognize the positive ones."	2298	
2299	1	"Dear local newspaper, The effects computers have on people is not exeptable. The effect make it bad for people. Also, the effect of computer bad for children and kids. The computer could also lead to not healthy body. There for the effect of computer on people isn't great. First, many effect on peolefrom computer is bad for them. The computer make people go blind and that really bad. If everyone goes blind then know will we discover new things and cook food. Another reason is that going blind could waste a lot of money for glasses and there about @NUM1! Many family can't afford glasses that make their children can't see! Another way computer has bad effect on people is that their body isn't right. Most people who uses computer everyday and don't excersie are fat. This is bad for your health. For example, I have a grandma who stays on bed and watch @CAPS1 every day. This is like usingthe computer. It turn out that her blood pressure was high since she don't move. It causes her to have stroke and now she in a nursing home. As we can see this could happen to people who uses computer everytime of their lives. Another way it bad for your body is because will spend less time with family number. Spending less time with family will make relationship of one another just break apart. For example, I have a dad who always go to friend house and newer spend time with me and my sis. So my dad and I don't really get along. So that why using computer bad for your health. Therefore, computer is bad for everyone. Next computer effect one bad for little kids. There bad because now website has ad that show someone naked or something not appropriate. As the parents can see this is bad for children who don't know anything nad start talking aobut it in school. Also sometimes computer show bad word and soon those kids who see it will learn the word and start to swear. A memory I had is that one day I was on the ocmputer and saw bad word and ever a lady in a bikini. As you can see I was very affonded by sseeing that. I was confused, another reason computer effect kids i because lots of the website give flase information aobut website a child went on to search sometimes it should give a child a incorrect information. One day I wnent on wikipedia and search panda. It said that the panda was blue. And we know it not right but the children don't know that. There, computer have a bad effect on children. Last but not least, computer effect is ad for people health. For example, I have a friend who eat junk food, while on the ocmputer doing something everyday. this was bad for her health. It turn out she had to go to the doctor for eating to much junk, see!! The computer mader has not exercise reusing her to be in a unhealthy situation. Also, most people would sit and look at the computer. This is bad for everyone blood pressure. Expecially when we eating and sitting. This could cause all of have high colesteo. another reason istant no one will excercise making you body fat and won't decrease fat cell. As we can see it bad for everyone health. Therefore, computer is bad for you. In conclusion, computer effect are bad for people and should be step. Since, it not good for everybody by not talking to family. Also computer effect is bad for little kid, since the bad ad. And last it always bad for your health. Thus, people should only use computer if needed."	2299	
2300	1	"Dear, Newspaper I think that computers are a good thing because you can talk to friends and family online. Also, I think Computers are a good thing because you can look up homework on it. Last, I think computers are a good thing because your hand-eye coordination will increase. Let's explore why I think it's good to talk to family and friends over the computer. First, because you can chat on aim and have a conversation. Also, you talk on facebook to see what your friends interested in and what they look like. Last, I think it's a good thing because you can also video chat to see how much older a family member is getting and just to make it feel like your talking to them right there if they far apart. Let's @CAPS1 why I think its good looking up homework. First, I think it's good for looking up home work because you can go on google or another site to look up something you don't understand or cause that's the only place to get the answer. Also, I think the computer is good for homework because if you left it in school you can get it off edline a school website that teachers post homework on. Last, I think that the computer is good for homework because for say math homework you don't have a calculator you can use the one on your desktop and if your computer dosen't have it you can type the math question in on google and it will give you the answer. Let's find out why I think that it will increase you hand-eye coordinaton skills. First, I think this because you typing will increase because you will wanna type quicker and you will start to know were all the keys are. Also, I think it would increase because if you play a sport your using hand-eye coordination. Last, it would increase because if you sit there typing and typing you will just get better. Now that's why I think computers are good and not bad for you. So I hope you take my ideas into consideration."	2300	
2301	1	"Dear @CAPS1-in-@CAPS2, More and more people today are using computers. They are making our lives better and easier, giving us a lifestyle that our ancestors couldn't of dreamed of. Computers make our world a better place. The society of mankind has always been social one. We @CAPS4 human beings have the need to be around and know about our friends and family. With computers, this has become drastically simpler and easier. Facebook, founded by @NUM1 years old @PERSON2 for the students of @ORGANIZATION1, is a site that allows not only communications, but true connection. A recent article in the @ORGANIZATION2 stated that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION2 had a facebook account. This is an incredible amount of people and because of this, not only kids but adults can connect with old friends that they don't know about. You never know, that third grade friend of your's might be the newest billionare. Let's say you did connect with an old friend on facebook, how would you communicate? With another invention that has changed our world forever, @CAPS3. Why send that message via ""snail mail"" when you easily have it sent and recieved in minutes. @PERSON1, a small buisness owner, recently stated, ""@CAPS3 allows met to connect with my customers, I can talk to them and get feed back on my products."" @CAPS4 you can see, @CAPS3 has helped @PERSON3 tremendously, @CAPS4 it does the rest of the world, even kids. But if your young, you might want something even better and faster than @CAPS3. What is this, you ask? Kids today can connect with each other over instant messaging, more commonly known @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @PERCENT2 of kids between the ages of @NUM2 and @NUM1 talk to each other over istant messaging. This allows them to chat and communicate, a proven thing to help kids develop socially, according to the medical examiner through all those advances computers help us to ""get connected"". For a moment, lets forget social networking, and get to something a touch more serious, buisness. The world revolves around money and buisness, just look around you. Most buisness run on computers, all of their records and information is all in computers. Remember those days when you would ""punch in"" a time card, well not anymore. These days you would swipe your key card through a scanner. Not only small buisnesses, but the biggest buisnes in the world is run by computers. The stock market is managed and dictated through computers. In fact, @PERCENT3 of investors buy their stocks online, on sites such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. And where do people get this money? It all comes from the banks. Online, people can manage their accounts or see if they can afford that @ORGANIZATION2 car. If you look at it mathmatically. According to the transition property. If computers run buisnesses in the world, the computers in the world. Through all of this, people need to know things. And the easiest way to do that is online. You can even get your daily news online, almost @PERCENT4 of news companies have websites, so you can check out the weather in @LOCATION3, or what just happened in the olympics. It is possible to go to @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION2.com and check out what is going on the world. Its not only news thats online, it's everything. Through search engine such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION4, one can find anything and everyone. Rose of the hospital for special surgery stated, ""I was about to perform surgery on a young man. I noticed a small if the bone marrow, so I googled it and saw it was a prelude to cancer"" This @ORGANIZATION4 result @MONTH1 men's life! We can also look back in history, @PERCENT5 of history is online, and anyone can access it. Through these advances, we have made human smarter.

I also use my computer to type my homework and email it to the teachers. I also have microseft word , wich is a easier way to stady from my slife show. As you can see a computer can make my life easier. Second, computers reach hand-eye cordination. I know because I contact the mause with my hand but I dont look at it. I have a @NUM1 and I was asking my self how do I. Use a control with out looking at it. hand-eye is like multy task. Some times I say to my self if we learned to hand eye imagine in the future. Third it alows us to contact others. My laptop has a webcam so every @DATE1 we see my my sister. The webcam is an easy way to talk and see others. You can also see other people with skype or @ORGANIZATION1. As a result it turns out to be good. As you can see these are my reasons. Faster way or reaserch. It teaches hand-eye cordinations.

Taking away computers in our society will help the health and saftey of out people. I demand you to make this choose. Its important for our health. We shouldn't be staring at a computer for too long like most of us. We should be going for a jog or to the gym not sitting staring at a screen. My cousin @PERSON2 from @LOCATION3 was obese. She use to spend @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. Soon she realized she was @NUM2 pounds. She stop playing the computer and started to join a gym. Now, she is @NUM3 pounds and didn't go on her computer since then. Therefore, computers do affect your weight. Also, computers affect you vision. @PERSON2, eye doctor from @LOCATION2, says more people are going blind because they use the computer to much. @PERCENT1 of her patients have contacts or glasses. Don't forget! Even a simple move of a mouse is a health risk. I took a survey of @NUM4 different doctors. They all said many people are getting carbol tunnel from the motion of moving a mouse. Computers are a health hazard to @NUM5's of people. Computers affect the saftey of many people. You never know who is on the other computer. My friend @PERSON4 from @LOCATION4 was on the computer talking to her best friends @PERSON3. @PERSON3 said he didn't want to be friends any more. She asked him in school the next day if it was true and @PERSON3 was confused and didn't know what she was talking about. Their are hackers in the world. @NUM6 out of @NUM5 people get hacked or cond each day. If you don't want to listen to me then listen to @PERSON1, police officer from @LOCATION1, says their are more computer crimes then any other crime in are whole state. Computers aren't the safest way to communicate. Its suprising we haven't got rid off computers already. I does affect the health and saftey of the people in our town. I implore you to take away for these reasons."	2305	
2306	1	"Crunch! That is the sound of another kid eating chips while on the computer. More and more kids are becoming overweight because of techknoledgy. Especially computers. People are spending time inside, not exercising. They will stay in their room and become loners too. The last and perhaps most important problem with computers is that they take away our chances to learn. We need to stop this virus of computers now before we are all taken over! Don't you just love to go for a nice run or jog? I do, but now, kids would rather stay inside and play computer games. The number of overweight people in @LOCATION1 have increased a lot since we all had computers. I can remember when I used to spend almost my whole life on the computer it broke down and i had nothing to do, so I started to work out. I lost @NUM1 pounds in one month! Do you see how much better our lives would be without computers. The deaths from sickness do to weight would plummit to almost none. We need to stop using computers so many teens just look themselves away in their room. They stay on the computers and just forget the world around them. They will throw away their whole social life, just to talk to random people on the computer. There are many child abductions in the world to the computer. They meet some stranger online in a chatroom and then they decide to meet in person the next thing you know, the mom is crying and her son/daughter is nowhere to be found. Do you really want this to happen to your child? And this is just one of many problems with computers. When a teacher assigns a book report no one actually does it. They just go on the computer and print one off. This is not going to help us learn. It does the exact opposite of that instead of students actually reading, they just find a quick summary of the book online. If parents want their kids to do well in life, then throw out their computer. Let your kids do work for themselves. I know that from what you just read you can tell that computers have negative effects on people they make us unhealthy, and drive us away from other, we have an easy life because of computers but is it a better one? Computers are bad for us, and now you can see that."	2306	
2307	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have heard some peoples opinion’s about computers some say that when people spend time on the computers they spend less time on other things, then I heard that spending time on the computer gives the ability to learn more. Please heed my advice. I agree that computer’s benefit society. First of all, using the computer saves money. For ex. You want to look up book’s to study or read, you can look it up on the computer, then read it online, instead of buying them. You can also watch movies and listen to @CAPS1 on the computer instead of buying them, statistics say that the average people who use the computer, save about half as much as they spend the percentage is @PERCENT1 save @PERCENT2 doesn’t. Computers help in lots of ways, it helps with assignment for school to look more presentable and educated for class, you'll also look prepared. Computers help with presentations for school and for your jobs. I remember when I got my computer I began to know more about technology and things I never knew before, I did presentations using @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I also did math games online to help me with math. Then, two average boys who shared there there names @ORGANIZATION1 there both around @NUM1 the age teens go crazy on technology, @CAPS4 @PERSON2 say’s, “computer’s give people the ability to learn more and learn about different things”. Then @PERSON1 say, “spending too much time on computers take time away from exercise and enjoying nature.” In conclusion, I would like to say that now that you have heard two different opinions including mine that you have more of a better stated opinion."	2307	
2308	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, The truth is computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, people spend too much time on the computer and forget that they have a real @CAPS6. Millions of people create unhealthy relationships with people they might not even know. Harvard studies show that @PERCENT1 of teenagers have ""friends"" that they only ever talk to on the computer. Some people even get so addicted they forget how to behave & interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 once said, ""@PERCENT2 of kids who own a computer, don't have many friends because they have forgotten the appropriate way to act. Another thing is, spending so much time on the computer is an unhealthy decision. Once you make it, you don't have another option. Although there is so much information on the internet, it's not the best way to learn it. First of all, it takes the joy out of learning. Wouldn't you rather go swimming than look up if humans are less dense than water? According to a @CAPS4 study, @PERCENT3 of children & adults can absorb more information if they learn it hands on. You can think of a computer like potato chips. Once you experience it once, you just can't stop. If you're always on the computer, there's always another way of doing the same on the computer. Some people will argue you can learn hand-eye coordination by using the computer. In the end, computers don't make you happy, so why not learn the skill by playing tennis or piano? Also, if you're a parent that is always on the internet, you're setting a bad example for your children by giving them the message of being lazy & don't do anything with your lives. By being active a @ORGANIZATION1 study shows that you will be more likely to pick an apple as a snack then a chocolate bar because you want to feel good about yourself. It is important for our community that we raise children with a good, succesful background that know how to interact & cooperate with others. Lastly, the only thing the computer is good at is spending all of your money. In a highschool student poll, most children would choose a free way of hanging out with friends than having to spend money & repairs to video chat. With computers, you don't get the full effect of anything you do, & they even make you pay for it. Also, it becomes a competition of who's got the most up-to-date technology which is another bad habit to get into. Oprah @CAPS5 once said, ""@CAPS6 is a way better bargain than a computer."" @CAPS7, computers have a negative effect on all people of size, color, & age. they don't let you live the full, healthy, care-free, joy as @CAPS6 you are supposed to have a choice to have."	2308	
2309	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that the use of computers is out of control. If people keep on letting the computer take over their life, then pretty soon you wont remember how to talk to people in person, wich is just one way that computers are changing people. In no time at all people will be so consumed with being on their computers that america will become more obsess then we already are last, computers are a recourse to do work and research, if we are using them for other things we could be in a bit of trouble. It is shown in recent research that @PERCENT1 of americans use online sites. If this keeps going on through the computer then in no time at all people would be extremly unsociable because that forgot hour to talk to people in person. Without their computers they don't have time to think about what they are going to say next, this will lead to a very awkward situation wich no one enjoys. Instead of being on a dating sit then for you could go out with your friends and have a good time and meet people, wich I personly think a person I dont even know who they are. Imagine, its a beautiful day you are about to up your dog and go for a jog in the park but then uou hear the all to ""you got mail"". You forget about your dog and the jog and go over to your computer to check out you emailed you this could lead to a very unhealthy habbit that we cant afford. America is already clasified so over weight, so do you think instead of going out on a nice day, that you are huncher over at your desk typing on a computer, soon our country will have a major issue, so set off of that computer and go outside! Im not saying that compiuter amt a greta recourse to look up information on but that is all they should be used. If everyone used computers for only work then there would be no longer issue at all, but that far from happining. I think people should only be to use computers for work and education purposes, wouldn't that be the day. Now I hope you relize how computers are affecting people by making them home and be less not going out to nexercise and not uses them for only. I hope you listen to my reasons and use your computers more now!"	2309	
2310	1	"In my opinion I think people spend more time on the computer when they could be outside enjoying nature with friends and family. Therefore I think that most experts are right people should get off the computer and get outside. The three reasons that support my decision are people health less bonding time with others and that a computer screen can hurt your eyes in the long run. The health of people these days is going down more people are becoming obese and some of the reason is the @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 screens they are sitting behind inside. Studies have shown @PERCENT1 of obese people are on the computer for more the @NUM1 hours in one day. When I feel when there is nothing to do you could go outside play a sport take a walk. there are so many things to do outside and it makes me think why people don't go out and enjoy it! Some people use the excuse of its winter so I can't go outside but you can go outside all year-round. My second reason is you can bond with friends and family. I would rather talk to someone face-to-face than on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 messager. When you sit on the computer you won't get to talk or see anyone and you will lose social skill from just talking to people on @CAPS2. You might never want to get off the computer but think about it you would be able to hang out with them at cinerom or fuzion zone. My third reason is using a computer can hurt your eyesight in the long run. Staring at that bright screen for a while espically everyday can put a strace on your eyes and can make your eye sight go bad. Computers aren't helping you they are actually hurting you. So if you want good eyesight get of the computer and get into exercise and the beauty of nature. In conclusion if you want to be a friendly fun to talk to, skinny person with great eye sight hop out of those computer chairs and into nature. The choice is up to you."	2310	
2311	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to discuss computers having a problem with human nature. Meaning, many people not going outside for fresh air or not exercising. A question that goes through my head is, ""do computers give knowledge?"" @CAPS1 that I mean do people get smarter when on the internet because people have a chance to read on learn new things like new words. People say that @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 has interfered with school work and dont get it done, but kids when on the internet get to talk friends and family is useful. Computers have advanced our technology and @MONTH1 bring it to the next level. In my own opinion computers aren't interfering with exercising or enjoying nature because people see creative ideas to do in nature for example, when people are ""bored"" they @MONTH1 go on youtube to maybe find something to do just to got the brains pumping and discover new things. Usually people have been becoming addicted to the internet and wont let up, because the internet is basicly a virtual world and make us really creative like I said before. As as virtual world I mean people who enjoy the process of @CAPS5 thats why some people become. This is my statement on my opinion to what effects computers have on people."	2311	
2312	1	"Dear whom ever it @MONTH1 concern, I agree with the people that this doesn't benefit society. My first reason is we don't get up and go outside. My second reason we don't sleep much. My last reason we don't do much homework. First, we don't get up and play outside, we don't enjoy the fresh air. For example, we stay playing games or listening to music, that we don't even get are exercise. People ask, ""why people gain wieght?"" @CAPS1, because they spend all the time on the computer, just sitting there. This is important because we need are exercise to get healthy, but with technology all they get is being lazy. Second, we don't get are rest, are @NUM1 hours of sleep. For example, people stay up on the computer until its atleast @NUM2 or @NUM3 o'clock in the @TIME1. What do they do through out the hours? @CAPS1, they be on myspace, yahoo, aol, and/or @CAPS2. This is important because you need to sleep to walk up to go to work, school, or even for the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, we don't get homework done. For example, we get name from school and get right away plugged in, is like if we are the computer's plug. Why do they rush to the computers? @CAPS1, because they want to find out about gossip or the latest games. This is important because we need are education. In conclusion, @CAPS3, we do need are computers, but not all the time not for games or myspace. This is not as important as your health or as your education. Computers don't give your life or your career, You do!"	2312	
2313	1	"Many people have different ideas on computers. Some say computers have positive effects and others are more towards the negative side. I am towards the negative side. With computers, companies lose money, people don'@CAPS2 get enough excircise and relationships are reducing. Computers have everything you could ever watch, play, and dream of in them. That is why companies like comcast, @ORGANIZATION1, and music industries are losing money. People don'@CAPS2 want to pay for @CAPS1., games, and music so they go on the computer to watch it. On the computer free @CAPS2.V. is very popular. You watch you favorite show whenever you want to, for free! My favorite website is @CAPS3 because it has every video you can ever want to watch. I go on there and watch it for hours. It's a really bad habit. Millions of people watch it everyday and night! Computer games are now very popular. You can play them for free and never get tired of them. I play them because I don'@CAPS2 wan'@CAPS2 to spend my money on @MONEY1 games only to have them break when I drop them; I want games that are fun and free. Doctors and experts have seen that now a days people don'@CAPS2 get enough excirsice because they are on the computer all day. This is sad because we should all play outside everyday. What's even worse is that when people are sitting infront of the computer they are eating. This does not burn calories, it infact, does the oposite. In @LOCATION1, this is our biggest problem because we are not getting the exircise or nutrition we need. People need to play outside more and become more healthy or else we'll become less active and move like boulders. Our relations with one another is very immortant for your social health and needs. It gives you a nice balance in peoples lives. Lately this has been a problem because a lot of parents are getting divorced. What do you think coused this problem. People are spending to much time at work. what are they working on I computers. When they get home they will be too focused on their work that they wan'@CAPS2 even say hi to their children and wives. This is very sad because you might never see them agian and your ignoring them. If your a child it will be the same but instead with your friends. Computers do not help your social life. Computers are a way of life for some people. They will never break the habit of it. They are sucked under the spell of the computers and it's a hard spell to break. Computers effects are not benefitial they are hurtful."	2313	
2314	1	"Dear editor, I say you should let people go on the computer! A computer lets you do many activites like playing games, socializing, and many other activites. I say you should let people use computers because some people need a computer for work, kids that use computers might want to be video game designers, and you can talk to your friends or family on the computer. If your asking yourself do I really need a computer at work the answer is yes. Some jobs are different than others so you might need a different program on your computer. Take my mom for example she works of @ORGANIZATION1 and she helps people everyday on the computer and on the phone. I say all jobs should have a computer. Did you know @PERCENT1 of kids that played or is still playing video games might want to be video game designers. It's true kids enjoy playing video games on different systems. Eventhough, the computer is where all the videe games are made from. Kids that want to become video game designers want to try to beat the number I video game. Kids just love video games so much and if your addicted to your video game system you might want to become a video game desinger. Have you evern told your friend or family members you would talk to them later? Then they get mad at you because you lied and then they go on thier email and see you emailed them. That's called email you can talk to your friends or family on the computer. It's safe unless you get email from random people, you might want to stay away from those. messages are that cause viruses. Email is the way to talk to your friends or family. BLAM! Thats all I have to say about the subject. So if you didn't catch my reasons some people need a computer for thier job, people who use computers might want to be game designers, and you can talk to your friends or family on the computer."	2314	
2315	1	I think people should keep their computers because they need to find job application and they need to send emails to parents to see if they got the job or not. We need computers because kids need to learn how to work with technology and work with the keys and they can play learning games on the computer that teaches them how to read write and spell. And then people who wants to exercie they can mak a plan when people get up hop on the computer and check there email then for like an hour or two they can excersize. And for college and high school kids they need computers to do a essay or exames and type a @NUM1 letter page about something and they can't do that if they don't have computers. When teachers are at work they need to go home and check our homework that was do on the computers and our grades. And job when they run through your lisense it runs through the computer to see if it's your real lisense or not. Police stations needs computers so they can run through your lisences plate. The airport need computers so they can see what flight is going where.	2315	
2316	1	"Do you own a computer? Do you use it to work, play games, or even talk to family and friends? Computers are getting more and more popular, and advanced. The use of computers is liked and disliked by various people. I personally agree with the people who like using computers for these next three reasons. If you are a stay at home mom or dad, you can still work, the computer allow you to stay connected with family members and friends, and you can play fun games and such on a computer. These are my three top reasons why I think computers are useful and have a lot of benefits, I wonder what other reasons people could have! To all stay at home mom's or dad's working is not a thing of the past! You are still able to work straight from home! How appealing does that sound? To me, very! Just picture yourself waking up, not even getting out of you're @CAPS1's or if you have a laptop you don't even have to get out of bed! I would think that staying home all day but still making money would sound like a pretty great idea, don't you? Do you have relatives or old friends, or even new friends, that you want to reconnect with? The computer is a great way to do ! Websites such as facebook, myspace, or aim allow you to talk to. right now, I have a screen chatting with people, but only people I know of course! As a matter of fact, facebook helped me find my three friends from us field. When I lived in another town, they were my best friends! I recently was just talking to them. Computers are great for finding and catching up with people! Spending tons of money on pointless video games, x-boxs, or @CAPS2's? There's no need anymore! Computers have many websites with thousands of really fun games! Don't bother wasting your money on things that kids could play for free right on the computer. Even though you're still playing video games which are pretty much pointless in life, kids don't seem to think so, and you can still act great benefits like saving a lot of money! If these three reasons I stated above haven't persuaded you, I don't know what will! I think working from home, talking to friends and family, and playing fun and free games on the computer sounds great! I strongly believe computers can make you're life easier, and you can have a lot of fun on them. After reading my opinion on computers, hopefully you agree with me too!"	2316	
2317	1	"Dear Local Newspaper I thint that computers have a positive efect on people also they teach hand eye coordination and it helps learn about far away places also you can talk to your friends on line I hope you consider reading on. My first reason is computers have postive efect on people for example they can tell you about your taxes and how much you could recive or they have collge on line were you can work on geting your dirgre if your a dropout you still can get your @CAPS1.E.D. to also on line. My second reason is it teaches hand eye coordination fore example in the school theres this program called type to learn @NUM1 and it work on you typeing skills and how you can improve on typeing skills also help you get familiar with the keys and the letters on the keyboard also there games on how you can become a beater typer. My third reason is how you can learn about far away places a good hotel you can stay for the or help find homes in or visit a frend in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 you could buck a flight or see wich one is cheaper for your bujet and you could go on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find were your buddy lives. I hope you consider my persuasive letter you of some reasons first it has a positive effect on people second it teaches hand eye coordination and third you can learn about far away places. I hope you consider my letter."	2317	
2318	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and technology have finally caught up with humans in the twenty-first century. These new and highly created devices, known as computers, will help many people succeed and advance in the nearest future. They will help people learn, interact and get smarter through the coming ages. First, computers can help people learn anywhere and everywhere. Whether it be forgotten homework or the latest news-article, computer can help with learning. People don't like to read books; they have the internet reading over a thousand words, even if it's on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Not only that, but computers can people learn about the world, by searching it on a search engine. It can help them about a places language, culture, people, food, style, and so much more, with a simple click of a mouse. Second is social interaction. Computers help people communicate to others even if they're far away. Higher and newer technologically advanced computers are very fast nowadays, downloading instant messengers will be a snap! if people have webcams with microphones (built-in or not), it can be use so much more better than a' telephone call; you get to see them and talk to them! Very convenien for families who have sons/daughers who live far away or in college, and also convenient to familes who have loved ones that are around the globe that they can't see. Lastly is computers helping people get smarter. Reading is everywhere that you see and go; so are math, science and social studies! Nowadays, textbooks are online, so they help students do their homework at home if they forgot it or if they were out sick. Online learning can also help homeschooled kids do work and college kids who are staying at home. With the help of faster, better and smarter technology, computers are a helpful and convenient device to people. Computers can help people open their minds with other places and its people and culture, talk online through @CAPS5 or online chat places with family, friends and strangers (whom you should be careful about), and learn online at home and everywhere. Thank you for time in reading my letter."	2318	
2319	1	"Dear, to whom ever this @MONTH1 concern In my opinion I think that computers have an neagative affects on people. One of my reasons for feeling this way is that computers could be very harmful to people. Another reason, is that instead of exercising people are on the @CAPS1. Also lastly computers are putting people out of jobs. Computers can be very harmful. There are both of bad things on the @CAPS1, there are also lots of bad people such as child abducters, and killers. You never are really sure who you are talking to because on the @CAPS1 you can pretend to be anyone. You can never be to safe. Secondly, instead of going out and playing or exersising people much rather be on the @CAPS1. A lot of people in @LOCATION1 and all over the world are oveweight. We could all use a little exercise every and in a while. I'm sure if they were more active instead of being on youtube, myspace, facebook, or twitter the rate of people being overweight would go down. Lastly computers are putting people out of a job. A @CAPS1 could basicly do anything more than a person can do. This puts a lot of people out of work. The computers are taking their jobs away, this is not good for the economy. Lots of people need jobs at this time. This is how I feel about computers, that they are dangerous. I think they stop people from exercising. Lastly, they are putting people out of a job."	2319	
2320	1	"Have you ever felt like you were missing some things in life? Do you ever wish you chose another job activity that your free time? Now, these questions can be brought to many different points but if a computer comes to mind in any of your answer you need to keep reading. I strongly believe computers have a negative effect on people. First off did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obese?! This means adults and children are spending too much time in front of the computer and @CAPS2 screens, causing a person to spend less time excersizing. Joining a gym @MONTH1 just be way for you to your social life you go from chatting on instant messaging  to having you-feel +all day you should. Everyone wants a good, strong, supportive, happy family. Happy people have trustworthy friends and know how to laugh with them. Put yourself in this position. Your best friends passed away @TIME1. you were too busy emailing and searching for friends to add on @CAPS3. You didn't answer your phone when your best friend calling because you were ""busy"" @CAPS4't let this be you so for a time to spend with your friends. Have everyone over @CAPS5 to @CAPS5. Our parents, uncles cousins, grandparents and nephews will always be there for help also love and support. A complete is far from helping anyone that so @CAPS4't let your computer become your friend. It's now or never! computers are negatively affecting people but of all this relationship with family and friends. So its your turn to go out there are support getting people. All ages to come outside become happy without computers."	2320	
2321	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I feel that the effects that computers have on people is good one for two reasons. One, it allows people to get information faster. Two, it allows people to stay in contact with each other in an easier way. Here are some reasons to support my opinion. My first reason was because it allows people to get information faster. This is a good thing because it allows people to have more free time during the day to either sleep, make food for their families, exersize, or even just to lounge around. For example, a few weeks ago I had a project due for @PERSON1, I am usually very active so I didn't have enough time to do the project. When I woke up the day the project was due I freaked until I remembered that I had a computer, with the computer being there I was able to start and finish a project that would normally take me an hour with books and I finished in @NUM1 minutes and recieved a very high grade, In addition, this is why having a computer is much easier. My second reason is because it allows people to stay in contact with each other longer and in an easier way. The reason as to why I say this is because before my step mom passed away her and my step sister used to talk on email a lot. We lived in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2 lived in @LOCATION2. Also, it is so much easier because with things such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. Also you have to do is just sign in and type. In conclusion, these are my two reasons as to why I feel the computer has a good effect on people."	2321	
2322	1	"It seems like everyone is using computer today. Male or female, young or old, everybody can benefit from a computer. They are are easy to get and have a large range of pricing. Everyone should own a computer. This technology makes communication easier, provides entertainment and can help for educational purposes. Have you ever called a friend on the phone, only to get their answering machine? If you have to tell them something important then, this can be very frustating. The internet makes talking to your friends a whole lot easier. You can type up an email to a friend you haven't talked to in a few months. You can also chat with your friends who are on the same time you are. Most internet chatting is free, so you can stay on as long as you want and not even worry about running up your bill. Several people I know use their computers to keep them entertained. When your friends are busy and there's nothing on @CAPS1 you can always go on a game website. Many stores, such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 sell games you can download onto your computer as well. You can also listen to your favorite bands and discover new ones on the internet. Websites like @CAPS4 and let people watch showa from their computer that they either missed or just want to watch again. Many people are surprised when they find out computers. Whenever students have to do a research paper, the number are resource they use is @ORGANIZATION2. If people want to learn more about something on their own, The internet is a quick and simple way to do it. Instead of going to the library to take out a look, why not hop on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 to help you with your report. Many @CAPS7 school graduates take college courses online too.Clearly, a computer is a piece of tachnology everyone can enjoy. It provides an easy way to talk to your family and friends. It puts a little fun into our lives. If you want to research anything from a vacation spot to your favorite celebrity a computer can help you. Computers really are an incredible invention."	2322	
2323	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people believe computers have a positive effect while @CAPS1 believe they have a negative effect. Copmuters help keep distant friends and fmaily in touch. They help save time and money for parents of bored children or lazy family members. Lastly @CAPS1 jobs and kids school careers would be different without computers. Computers have a larg, good impact on our society. Remember your best friends from college or that boy from @CAPS2 you were always to talk to! Well now with the advancements in computers you can reconnect with lost friends or distant relative. One very popular way to keep in touch is facebook, where you can serach old friends or family. In the news @CAPS3 there was an article about a @NUM1 year old girl found her father after @NUM2 years. It turned out he had been looking for her too and she visits himevery weekend. Another way to keep in touch using the computer is instant messaging or email where you can talk by typing and sending messages to each other and pictures can be sent via email to people all over the world. A last way family and friends can stay in touch is with skype which is a database you can video chat with anyone who has this sysytem downloaded on their computer. Computers not only keep people in touch they also help save time and money. Its six o'clock on @DATE1 @TIME1 and you have nothing to eat and your spouse your car. What are you going to do? Now with computers you can order to go food online or which is a service provided by stop and shop which grocery shops and delivers your food to you. Also if you need a new appliance, shoes, clothes, or what ever you @MONTH1 need you can buy it online at stores and it will be delivered for you saving you time and gas money. Lastly, you @CAPS5't have to pay for gas or arcade fees for your kids anymore because there are wide varities of games online. On good mornign @CAPS4 they interviewed a @NUM3 year old boy who had never been to an arcade and had no desire too because he could play games online. When you are done playing games you can stay at your computer and work. Amny jobs today could not be done if there weren't computers. if you stay at home or go to an office building for work you are sure to use a computer in some way to get your assignment done. Also advirtismnet companies are almost completely run off computers when you are on a site and there is a flashing box the say ""You @CAPS5!"" that is an advirtisment. Another group comuters help are students. Students can use online textbooks or get their home work assignments. For example there is a high school in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 that n o longer has textnooks fro students to bring home. The students all have laptop computers for textbooks typing assignments and other homework. Computers help get jobs done. Computers have a great impact on our society today. They help families and friends keep in touch. They save @CAPS1 people time, money and effort. Lastly, computers help students and the working class get jobs done. Computers have a good effect on people today. "	2323	
2324	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I have been hearing about people fighting over computers and if they are or are not good for our us. But I do have to say that I think they are good. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons why I say this is because it will allows you to talk to friends and family that are away or they can even be accross the street. @CAPS7 over all it's a great way to keep in touch with people. It also helps kids with school work. For example you @MONTH1 find games that will help you in @CAPS2 ever class you need or you can find information on certain things that you need to know for projects. The last idea I can come up with is that you can pay your bills online. You @MONTH1 not think this is a big topic but it is. Say if you have a bill that due tomorrow you can get emails stating that you have a bill due tommorrow and how much you need to pay. @CAPS7 these are my reasons for agreeing with the fact that computers are good for us. Alright, lets get started. My first reason for thinking that computers are good for us is that you can stay in touch with people such as your friends and family. But although there is the risk @ORGANIZATION1 people talking to strangers but that is their @CAPS2 I mom by that that they mine a stupid choice and they face the consiquences. But other than that most people do the smart thing and talk to the friends @ORGANIZATION1 family @CAPS3 or @CAPS4-@CAPS5 theres just a great @ORGANIZATION1 things you can do to stay in touch with friends and family. @CAPS7 I hope you are starting to think about the good things computers do for us. Well @CAPS10 it is time to tell you my @NUM1 reason for thinking computers are for us. This topic is school working is almost every class room you walk into there is a computer. The computers really help got school work They canprovide information on projects or even provide little games for extra help and I bet @NUM2 out @NUM2 students would agree with me. For example I just had a project on the ""@CAPS6 @NUM4's"" and I used my computer to find information about @CAPS7 it I can use the @CAPS8 for school work you can to. Alright @CAPS10 to start off my third reason for thinking @CAPS8's are good for us heres a quote from @PERSON1. ""@CAPS10 that we have had @CAPS7 many advances in technology it is @CAPS7 much easier to pay your bills online."" @PERSON2 is the top guy at @ORGANIZATION1 and he even thinks that paying bills online is a great help too. Plus if you forget about a bill they will send a to your @CAPS4-@CAPS5 or even give you a call. I even think it is easy. I watch my mom pay her bills and it is just click click done. This is my final reason for thinking that computers are good for us. @CAPS10 that you have heard my ideas I hope you join me and the other @NUM5 million people that think computers. But these three topics I just wrote about are only same @ORGANIZATION1 the things that computer makes easier. There are just @CAPS7 many things you can do on the computer. @CAPS7 I hope you agree with me. But I hope you remember the computer is as easy as a click @ORGANIZATION1 a botton."	2324	
2325	1	"It has come to my @CAPS1 that not everyone agress that computers benift society which I @MONTH1 add I dont think they do! In the past @PERCENT2 of people who have lived in the past days want say what they say now. My first resson is because kids who have bad health and there on computers there not doing any good for them selves either than becoming a couch potato playing computer games. But I play on computers but I still get the exercise I need to get and I like to be active. I think they should just stop selling computers cause they went get any where in life just sittin around playing world of worcraft all day. Secondly, the time it must take to download stuff thats the time you could be taken to go run a mile but I dont know. Thats your gugs porogaitive. Dr. @PERSON1 from the brain clinic on computers has stayted more than @PERCENT1 of people who have computers tend to stop doing there social activities and foucus more on video games and not there school work. If I was a parent I would through the computer out the window. In conclusion I dont I think its a good benifit in society to have computers. I urge you to change what you half to do in order to change this society to be better and healthyer thoun it is right now. Well desion is up to you."	2325	
2326	1	"I think that computers doesn't benefits society. I agree with that because people send too much time on the computers, talk to people they don't know and watch things they souldn't be watching. One reson I think that computers don't benefit us is people send too much time on it. I use to be on the computers all the time, but when @DATE1 came and my family went on a trip, I saw what I became without a computer around. I also saw that I was pulling myself away from my family, so I said that I will not go on the computer for a long time. So now, I hang with my family more, then if I want to, I go on the computer for @NUM1 min. (but most of the time I don't) But as you can see, I almost lost myself to the computer and that is way I don't think computers benefits us. Reson two I think that computer don't help us is you could be talking to someone you think you know, but don't. You can be a teen on the computer talking to your ""friend"" when your ""friend"" is @NUM2 years old. You put and show stuff that will get some old guy to want you, and he or she will pull the information out of you if you let them it out. They can ask you stuff that will help them find you and you wouldn't know. That is another reson I belevae that computers do not benefits you. The last reson I belevae computers are not benefits is kid and teens will watch stuff they souldn't be on it. I have a friend, fath, and she was so good, but then she move away and I didn't see her for two yaers. When she move back she change and she said because she saw stuff on the computer, everthing changed for the way she see things. I didn't want to be friends with her anymore because of what she saw, on the computer. Also, my cuosin's friend does the same thing and got my doing it so I don't talk to her any more. See what the computer does to people. That is why I think the computer does not help us, because it get you to slit you and your family, talk to people you don't know, and watch things that you souldn't watch."	2326	
2327	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, although use on @CAPS1, I still believe the computer has a positive effect on society. The computer helps our society with a lot of things, like learning, to talk to far away reletives, and it also helps school with the different programs for teaching. I know some people say people are spending too much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Lets talk about learning. The computers helps kids learn hand-eye coordination which could help in sports and other activities. It also lets you learn about far away places today not a few years ago like in books. It teaches responsibility also by letting kids chose betwee the good and the bad websites. Having a computer also allows you to talk to people wich is a good thing because some people have faraway reletives that they dont talk to on the phone often. It lets you talk to close friends if you dont have a phone. It also lets you to communicate with long distant friends. The computer helps with teaching too. For example, teachers use @ORGANIZATION2 word to create their notes. The computer is hoolsed up to smart board wich is constantly used. Teachers base a lot of activities for the use of the computer. The teachers assign students projects that must be done by a computer. The computer as you see has a lot of positive affects on society, which is a good thing."	2327	
2328	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In these few years, technolgy is more edvanced than ever. That means more and more people are using computers all the time. Some people thought that using computer is not a good idea. But I believe in an other theory, and there is lots of great things computer brought us in our live. Use of computer teaches hand-eye coordination, give the ability to learn more, and allow people to talk with others. The hand-eye coordination really helps people in daily lives. First, all jobs today are all revolding around computers. @CAPS6, having a sence of using a computer is needed in order for people to get a job. In fact, high school are having classes to teach student about and how to use the computer. In class, the teachers teachs hand-eye coordination that allows the students to type faster. As one of my teacher back in @NUM1 grade said, ""@CAPS1 I was in high school, people pays me to type for them!"" @CAPS2 that we can see that person is having lack of hand-eye coordination which forced him to pay some one else to type his papers. If that person has proper hand-eye coordination in order to type fast, he might have a better job that what he had now. Computer also allows people to learn more. Secondly, computer give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Last marking periode, I did a project on the top @NUM2 @CAPS3 countries to go for vacation in. Without computer, I wouldn't be able to know the facts about these countries and finish my project. Computers has websites you can search anything you want. For example, @PERCENT1 of people in a company is searching stuff about other people. That other people might be their customers or, and these informations they got will help them get the bussiness case easier. In addition, people came up with websites that allows you to talk with others @CAPS2 far away. @CAPS4, a website where everyone in the world can join to talk and chat with friends or others. I guss you have an account on @CAPS4 just like me or your friends. As a research shows @PERCENT2 of junior high and senior high students goes home and the first thing that do after turning on the computers is loging on to @CAPS4 to see if their friends are on. I, personal, moved for an other country to @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, there are families of mine in my home country. The internet on the computer allowed me to talk to them on a webcam. Without computer my life will have a hole in it, because I won't know how my family is doing. I think that everyone who came @CAPS2 or other country think the same way as I do. In conclusion, using a computer is not a bad idea. It proves people hand-eye coordination, to learn more about faraway places, and talk to others faraway easily. If there was no computer, there won't be a @NUM3 centery as we called it. So, the using of computer is a wonderful thing."	2328	
2329	1	"I think that computers are good because you can communicate with family and friends trough a webcam or other local websites such as myspace, twitter, and facebook and also to play games and watch funny videos. But also we learn from the incyclopidia and google and other websites to get an education computers are helpful to us and we need computers because without them how are our young ones going to learn how to use computers. Also with out computers we cant know how are family and friends are doing and because we have computers dosn't mean that we can not use them. My father always told me he never went to school or college and he never got an education or how to use computers. thats why he wants me to use computers because he wants me to teach him how to use computers. Computers are helpful and we cant get an education without them yea we have teachers and they can give us an education but not as much as computers because technology is important to us. Also how are homeless people going to learn to use computers. Also how are people that didn't go to school are going to learn how to use computers."	2329	
2330	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that the computer companies think that people spend too much time on them? They also say we use computers so much, that we don's get any exersize? Basicly, the companies dont think that people should use computers. I disagree with this very much. I disagree eith this because people can exersize when ever they want to, people need computers for work/school, and if you don't have any kind of phone, you need to @CAPS3-mail them or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. My first reason why I dissagree with the computer companies is that people can go out and exersize when ever they want. Most people don't sit in front of the computer all day. They will get up and exersize around the block, or on a work out machine. If people do not exercize and do not get off the computer then they are wrong. People can make their own decision. My second reaon why I disagree with the computer companies is because people need computers for work and school. Kids and adults get a lot of projects these days. When they do get assigned one they most likely will need to type it up. Also, people with projects might need to get information on a famous person, and yes i know that that is what books are for , and if they dont have that person, then they need the computer. The computer is handy for prodjects and essays. My final reason why I disagree with the computer companies is if you don't have a phone and need to talk to them, you need the computer to @CAPS3-mail or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. If we didnt have the computers, and someone didnt have a phone, then they would not be able to tell them what they need to tell them. What if it was important? Or an emergency? The would never know... In conclution, The computer companies think that we dont need computers, and don't get enough exersize. I think they want, people need them for work/school projects, and because if you dont have a phone, then you need to @CAPS3-mail or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. You need to wake up and realize we need computers. You need to keep computers in this world! "	2330	
2331	1	"Dear Experts, I completaly agree with your idea that people should get out more and enjoy nature istead of being glued to a computer screen. I will be listing three reasons why people should not be attached to a computer. I hope you will understand my reasons. Computer screen damage your eyes by @PERCENT1! @CAPS2 example my eyes start to hurt whenever I stare at any kind of screen. And I work at the @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 so I can get away from the harmful screen. When you finally understant and knew your computer like your best friend, @CAPS1!!! It becomes your new best friend. You will never want to go to the outside world and become a lonely in never seeing anybody and the . I have gone to the trouble of interviewing his life. He said, ""first I woke up to find my on the keyboard and leaning of to my left and to my right at ,"" @CAPS2 breakfast he finishes his ""computer."" You don't see computer all day?!? Why are you! And example with my work at the @ORGANIZATION2 (@ORGANIZATION1) is that I get to get out of the house and have fun. Third people who stay at home with no friends and are studying, @CAPS2 example @CAPS3, never find out about nature. I exremely love my job because I got to be with nature Nature I feed the animals and get to go outside and admire the beauty of the world. @CAPS2 the computer! new you know my reasons and I with had I write. I agree with your statements like many others and I hope I can help you put it into action."	2331	
2332	1	"There has been an arguement that people spend more time on the computer instead of being outside. I disagree because most people don't own computers, also, two out of three people prefer spending time with friends, and if people do own a computer they are mostly for business purposes. Yes, computers do give people the ability to learn about far away places and they do teach hand-eye coordination, but that's not all they've good for. Some parents don't allow their children to own laptops or computers because of online chatting, inappropriate games, or inappropriate photos/videos. On that note, children are able to play outside get exercise, hang with friends, go to special events, etc. The parents are preventing their children from harm, inappropriate behavior/language, and from being lazy. The parents are realrcing the dangers of the internet. Would you rather sit a home staring at a bright screen or go to the mall, park, or basketball game with your friends? In fact, two out of three people would rather be with their friends. Some reasons you should be with your friends is you won't miss out on the latest gossip or the jokes that would only be funny if you were there. I could go on and on with a list of reasons why you should be with your friends and family instead of wasting your life on the computer for hours. Your friends need you now, your computer is always going to be there, but not your friends. The computer is also used for business purposes as well. There are jobs where people have to write long papers. So, the computer helps people become successful. I highly doubt people who own computers waste their vauluable time playing internet games rather than exercising with sports. Besides, who wouldn't want to take a break from the computer after writing along paper and staring at a screen for hours. I think I have made my opinion clear that people don't waste their time on computers. I think people understand that friends and family are more important than a computer. Also, if experts believe we are wasting out time on computers, then stop giving school technology privalages to have laptops and palm pilots."	2332	
2333	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I feel that computers have a negative effect on the population. You can do different things becide using the computer to acheve ""hand eye"" corrdination, talk to people in different ways, and gain information other than looking it up online. First of all, there are other ways to get ""hand eye"" corrdination besides playing on the computer. Playing sports such as fencing or baseketball can help you. Fencing is not just stabbing each other with sticks, it takes a great deal of mental focus and hand corrdination. Bascketball makes you work with your hands and feet all at the same time. It also teaches you teamwork which can come in very handy in the buisiness world. Next, while doing these activities you get fit. A computer does not strengthen you musles, besides finger musles, but excersise does. Playing sports is a great way to do it, expessally if you enjoy doing it. Even taking a musical instrument will help you gain ""hand eye"" corrdination. Playing the piano, for example will help your corrdination. After you active great ""hand eye"" corrdination, try doing other activities that help you set your next goal. In conclusion, while playing on a computer will allow you to get ""hand eye"" corrdination, doing a sport or playing an instrument wil help you more. To continue, some people think that the only way to talk to your friend is on a computer but it is not. To begin, there is a machine called a phone you could use. It is a better way to go because you can do something else while talking like gardening or looking. Also, letters can be usful, too. You might not be able to have a conversation but you can enjoy knowing how someone is doing like if they are on vacation. Finnally, it is the one thing I think most people today have forgoten is talking to someone in the same room. People have been doing this since the of man. Not talking over the phone or texting or email. Just looking at each other and talking at them, not in a phone or over a text message. To summerize, there are a lot of ways to talk to another person without using a computer. Finally, if we want to know something, we do not have to go emeditly go to the computer. The library is a great place to go and you might find a book there that you might to want to read. Libraries are one of the least visited spots in the @LOCATION1. Since you can look up anything online people have completly forgotten it. There is also a school. Teachers love to help people learn about things because that is there job. Finally, there are your parents. They know it all because they learned about it, too and love to bring it back to their mind. To conclude, more and more people each day turn to the internet to know things but there are places and people that know it, too. To wrap it up, computers effect on people is a negative relationship. People believe the only way to get ""hand eye"" corrdination is through the computer but there are other ways to do it, also if you want talk to someone you need to do it online and finally, information can not only be found online but, in places like the library. This is why I feel the the hold computers have on people is a negative one."	2333	
2334	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 waster your free time, on a beautiful, sunny day, in front of computer screen? In reality, computers don't have a positive effect on people. Instead of spending time outside or exersizing, @CAPS2 stay indoors at the computer. Also @CAPS2 lose sight of important things like spending time with friends and family, and @CAPS2 have pretty much lost face to face communication. @CAPS2 need to start going back to the times where @CAPS2 didn't worry about the computers and get back to worrying about the important things. Instead of spending time outside and exersizing, poeple just sit at heir computer. People blame @ORGANIZATION1 and other fast food placs for obesity, but computers can take the blame too. @CAPS2 forget to go the park and jog, but yet @CAPS2 remember to check our email for the fifth time. I'm sure there are people who do get to the gym and still spend time at the computer, but then there are the majority who don't. Computers take away the aspect of playing outside or exersizing at the gym and @CAPS2 need to start getting back to that. Secondly, @CAPS2 lose sight of the important things like spending time with friends and family. ""@CAPS2 forget about going to @LOCATION1's for dinner or having our friends sleepover,"" says one scientist. @CAPS2 are so worried about missing out on a chance to @CAPS3 someone that @CAPS2 don't go play catch with our brothers and sisters. @CAPS2 forget to make dinner once in a while to give our parents a break @CAPS2 need to start worrying about who and what is really important in our lives, and not the next new way to talk to our friends. Lastly, @CAPS2 have really lost face to face communication @CAPS2 don't worry about meeting with our friends to catch up, @CAPS2 just talk with them in a chatroom. Think about the best friend you haven't seen in @NUM1 years wouldn't you rather see them again, than type the words you want to say? Teenagers how-a-days just open up their cell-phone and send a text message to say""hi"" or they just open up facebook on their computer and chat with someone. @CAPS2 need to step away from the computer and step back into reality. I see how someone might say ""But it's just easier. You have a barrier in front of you and you don't have to worry about messing up."" But really they are jsut saying that whatever they are saying is not something to be said in person, so they shouldn't be saying it all. I think that @CAPS2 should all step back and think about how computers have taken over our lives. Instead of going to the gym @CAPS2 sit at the computer, @CAPS2 forget about what is really important, and, also, @CAPS2 have lost face to face communication. @CAPS2 need to get a hold of ourselves and start thinking about how computers really effect our lives. I really think @CAPS2 should step away from the computer and in step into a pair of running shoes and go for a jog."	2334	
2335	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do not think computers are having a good effect on our society. They are not improving the health of the users, in fact, it is quite unhealthy, the users can't enjoy real life, and they spend less time interacting with real people. I know by the end of this letter you will agree with me. Over using computers is very unhealthy. @CAPS4 using a computer, time escapes from people, and the spend MUCH less time exercising. Doctor @ORGANIZATION1 says ""@CAPS4 watching @CAPS5 or using a computer people just keep eating if there is a bag of food in front of them, even if they are already full, it is one of the leading reasons for obesety"", @CAPS6 you can see, using a computer is a lot less healthy than it seems. Another problem with using a computer is that people don't enjoy real life. The user gets caught up in a vertual world that isn't even real. The real senery of outside isn't seen, wich can make people unhappy, and they don't know why. Also, @NUM1 people can get extremely caught up in virtual games, and forget about real life alltogether. Scientist @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 computer games can lead to depressionbecause the user doesn't get involved in real life, wich can lead to depression without then knowing it."" Computers aren't looking so good now, are they? Last, but ceartanly not least, using the computer causes the user to spend less time interacting with real people. People who think computers are improving our society say that you can talk to people online, but truthfully, it is not the same. People don't build social skills from talking online, wich can seriously damage children's entire life. Also, little kids are actting too atached to the computer, they come hom, and get on the computer. This causes childrens social lifes to be deprived. Computers are taking kids lives away. @CAPS6 you can see, computers are not @CAPS6 harmless @CAPS6 they seem at first glance. They are very unhealthy, restrict the user from enjoying real life, and the user spends less time interacting with real people. We need to find a way to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem than it already is!"	2335	
2336	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, With the wave of technology that comes with the twenty first century, computers have been a huge success. Almost everyone uses them reguarly, but are they really helping or hurting the ones that use them? Computers are not a nessesary part of life, and it would be benifical to all if we cut down on their use. Did you know that more than half the people in @LOCATION1 are overweight? With the oncoming swell of technology something else has been coming ur right behind it, @CAPS1. More and more people are becoming overweight because of their lack of exercise, and healthy eating. According to the editor in @CAPS2 magazine @PERCENT1 of people who use computers for more than half an hour a day are more overweight than the people who use them less. But the sad thing is, that most peole don't even realize they're being sucked in by their computer. As their local newspaper, it is up to you to tell the people about the dangers of overuse of their computers. Computers are also living people away from the outside world. When go to the mall with your friend if you can just order the same stuff online? Why go to the movies with your family when you can watch the same thing on you tube few free? People are thinking like this and they probably don't even realize it! Friends and family members can also talk to you on the computer with just a press of a button. This over extensive use of this electronic can not be healthy for people. Humans are ment to intract with each other, not sit in a house all day! It has also been proven that harrasment levels have gone up since the invention of the computer. This electronic makes it easy for people to bully other people online. This is espesially present among young adults, with the ever popular myspace and facebook.! A few taps on the keys and a mouse click, thats how easy it could be to bully someone online. Even if you wanted justice cyber bullres can make their identities unknown online. Bullying can make someone lose their confedince and self-esteem, which is never good for kids at such a young age. While computers can sometimes make our everyday lives easier, it is evident that they do more harm than good. They are the causes of weight gain in some people, the cause of bullying in another, and can even pull people away from their family's. It would benefit everyone if we cut down on there use"	2336	
2338	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I for one believe that computers do benefit people. They help people live their daily lives, they help society learn, and they help people interact together. If I didn't have a computer I couldn't chat with my friends or check the weather. The computer can be addicting but you choose how much you use it. This why I believe computers are a benefit to the @CAPS6. People rely on computers everyday for their daily lives. People use the computer for checking their email and for writing letters and papers. The computer helps us with @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 @CAPS7 we can writing things and make backup coies incase it gets lost. Were suposed to go forward in life and invent @CAPS1 things. Were not suposed to go backwards to writing draft after on parchment with a bottle of ink and. That is why I believe we should use computer to benefit our daily life. My second reason that computers are a benefit is because they help us learn. Whenever there is a @CAPS4 that I don't know I go to @CAPS5 to look it up. I know I can use a dictionary but the computer saves me time and energy. The computer also has @CAPS6 news that you learn about and it has more than just two peoples points, it has all the points from the people who rare what they think they should do. In general if you want to find a product you google it, or I do, @CAPS7 you get a ton of results and they can lead you to other things too. That is why I believe computers benefit you in learning. Computers have a third benefit, which is they help you interact with your friends and peers. If your friend is sick and has the flu you can chat him online or do a wedchat to tell him something. It benefits both of you because you friend gets to talk to you and you don't get sick. If you have a friend in another state or another country then you can chat with them. If you send letters it'll be to slow. Whenn you chat with others like on @CAPS8 you can meet @CAPS1 people who like the same things as you. This why computers are beneficial to people. As I've said before computers are beneficial because they help people with their daily lives, they help society learn as a whole, and they help people interact together. These are the reasons ehy I believe computers are beneficial to people. You said that people need to get exercise instead of spending time on a computer. What are you going to say next you want a on cars."	2338	
2339	1	"Have you ever imagined people around the world spending too much time in the computer and not being able to enjoy life? In my opinion people should spend less time in computers. Computers is a great distraction for people, especially kids. People should spend less time in computers and more time doing other things like for example spending more time with their family, exercising, and doing their work. @CAPS1 people do all of this things they will become more responsible and enjoy life. My first reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time with their family is because they will be better persons. A phycologist once sayd ""@CAPS1 a children spends time with their family then there is an enormous chance that that person will become someone in the future."" Spending time with your family is really important because you feel that you're loved and that your family cares for you. Doctors have found that when people grow up with a strong connection between them and their family, it make life easier for that person. Therefore @CAPS1 you spend more time with your family you will accomplish all of these things. My second reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time exercising is because you will decrease your chances of death. Researchers have found that @CAPS1 you exercise @NUM1 hour a day everyday day you will decrease your chances of death. Eexacising will not just decrease the chances of death, it will also make you look better physically. In addition you will also be healthier. I implore you to start exercising so that way you will have a long period of life. @CAPS1 you start exercising you will be able to of this things. My third reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time doing their work is because it will help them improve their grades. I have seen people spending more time in computers and less time doing work. The board of education have researched that @CAPS1 a student spends more time doing their work and less time in computers then their grades will increase by a lot. spending more time on your work will increase a students having capability. Teachers say that @PERCENT1 of the students who do their work have A and @CAPS2 in their classes. The other @PERCENT1 of the students have @CAPS3 and @CAPS2. @CAPS1 you start doing your work then your grades will definetly increase. @CAPS1 you want to accomplish all of these things then you have to spend less time in computers. Computers is the number @NUM1 distraction for all the people around the world. I implore you to spend less time in computers and more time with your family, exercising, and doing your work. @CAPS1 you try all these things I assure you that you will be able to accomplish them yet you will became a responsible and a better person."	2339	
2340	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 was you life like before there were the of advances in technology that we have today? Can you sincerely say that your personal and career life has become more efficient? Well, this is indeed because of computers. I believe that computers are the reason why our society has grown today, therefore I strongly feel opinionated that computers have positive effect on people. One reason that I think computers have a positive effect is because it allows you to be educated on news and certain topics rapidly. The next reason is because they allows you to communicate with others instantly. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on the environment. Imagine yourself living before the @DATE1. Think about @CAPS13 you would feel if you heard about a product that brought you into a separate world; a world where you could find anything out all in the comforts of your home. That world, writers at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, is the world wide web. The internet allows you to seek information from your own home, without making visit to the library! Also, if you forget to pick up daily newspaper or your magazine, don't worry because you can likely find coverage of that article online. Nowadays with parents walking around to try to get through the recession, children don't have the ability to get a ride to the back a library @CAPS8, no worries because your can read articles and discover it online. And even shop! @CAPS9 proven by these computers are a positive effect on humans for the reasons allowing this to live their but in a more orderly and the next reason why I strongly support the opinion that computers have a positive effect on people is because it allows all people to communicate with other @CAPS9 of today there are social networking @CAPS10 @CAPS11, iChat, and @CAPS12 a @PERCENT1 of people said that they these application of that @PERCENT1, @PERCENT2 said their lives has change for they can even take to in other of the and their bills have goo down! You know the communication They when it comes to computer @CAPS13 many times a day do you yourself observe or overhear people talking about being agreed! Surprisingly, an easy way to obtain a main goal in life to be green is owning a computers with email accounts accesable to the majority of @CAPS14, there is no need to use paper any larger. When you'd like to spread news it is common now for people to use email instead of making flyers out of paper. Also, I have heard about many newspapers going online so they don't waste paper by printing the news. Another example are students simply emailing their teachers their papers, instead of printing them. All in al I hope you see my points save the trees and go buy a computer, because computers not only make a positive effect on people, but also the environment. Computers, experts say, are the advance of the generation. Is this good or is it bad? You @MONTH1 asks. I clearly stated that I believe computers do in fact have a positive effect on people. One reason is because they educate you and allow you to recieve information on news much quicker. Next, they supply on accessable way to communicate. Lastly, they make for an better environment. I trust that you will make the right decision, fellow computer users, while forming your opinion."	2340	
2341	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever thought of how hard it would be to publish newspapers without computers? I have, and having to write hundreds of papers daily can be a pain. Computers have made our lives safer and more interesting. Our country's @CAPS16 is based on computers. I understand that people are becoming lazy and unhealthy because of this, but advances in technology positioned the @LOCATION1 as one of the most powerful countries in the world. The richest man in the world is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. He is famous for @ORGANIZATION2, a company that makes computers and computer platforms, like @CAPS8 @NUM1 and @CAPS8 @CAPS10. But why is he rich? Because people need computers. People need to communicate with each other. I myself know a lot more about computers than most people I know. This is because my father is a computer engineer. I know that computers can do things we can only imagine. We can find cures for diseases, like @CAPS11, @CAPS12 and diabetes. Yes, Computers might take away time that should be spent outside, playing a sport or watching nature. Some people might just turn on the @CAPS13.V to the @ORGANIZATION1, or play sports on their @CAPS14 @NUM2. That's too far, substituting exercise of your body for exercising your thumbs. But many jobs, @CAPS15 systems, and @CAPS16 systems depend on computers to work. Computers are very important to this world. I agree we are too dependant on computers, but if you are using computers for a good reason, there is no reason you shouldn'@CAPS13 use it. Everyone uses something related to computers atleast once a day."	2341	
2342	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 opinion is that computers should only be used for a little while, use when nessacary, or to exersice a lot if you want to stay on the computer a lot. First of all I say stay on the computer for a little while because if you stay on too long your eyes will get bloodshot, no time with family, and only stay on a bit if your playing a game. Only use when nessacary such as doing homework or looking up information, or just want to import save photos. Games are fine but not too much. And if you're a person that hes to stay on the computer for work or something, you must exercise, to stay on a lot. I say this because if you @CAPS4't exercise and you stay on a lot, it wont benefit you in any way, you will have bad health, and it will be hard to work in an office, if you @CAPS4't exercise. This is why I say ""@CAPS4't stay on the computer a lot. Only for a little while, use when nessacary, and, you must exercise if you do stay on a lot. You should agree with me too."	2342	
2343	1	"Dear, local Newspaper I belive that we should advance in technology because I think computers have a positive effect on people. It allows people to talk online with other people, they teach hand-eye coordination, and it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @PERCENT1 of the world thinks that talking online is better than talking on the phone. And you can set up a web cam so when it's not nice out side you can hook up your web cam and talk see each other with out leaving the house. If you dont have a phone you can go on you computer and email each other save you money to. My @CAPS1 will said when he had a computer it tought him good hand eye coordination but now that he dose not have a computer he lost that coordination. @PERCENT2 of the population of amaricans said with out hand I coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. like me I found my true love on the internet. More people find there lover's on the online chat room. Would you rather find you wife online then in person I wouldn't. It is a better experense. And you @MONTH1 be able to look a job on @ORGANIZATION1. I have a possitive effect on this letter."	2343	
2344	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the question if technology is bad or good, I believe it is causing more harm then good. This is because I think people are spending more time with computer then necessary. Here are some examples. The more time people are on computer the less socially interactive they become. For example, if a computer dominates your job, you can be missing time with co-workers. Also if childs life is dominated by computers it can be bad for their future. If a child doesn't make friends it's ok, but if doesn't learn how he could be in trouble. For instance, if a child spent most of their time on computers and don't learn to make friends when they are older they will have no one to rely on so they could become depress in their lonely world. Also they could become obese. This could happen if a child spent time on a computer not exercising they will just gain pounds which is bad for there future. If this cycle develops and then progressed our comunity could be very bad because we could turn into fat socially people. An addiction to computers could easily be developed because when you spend a lot of time on it you could become addicted to it. This would be bad because you would spend all your time on it apart from everything. Within this addiction you could develope many bad things. For starte is you probably would damage your eyes, and or everything I've talked about before, (obesity, depression, no friends) The final way that the computer is bad is because it prevents you from living a good life. For example if you developed any circumtance that I stated before you probably would be unhappy. Happines is one of the few qualities that makes life bearable. In my life I also think that sports and family are important so once again if you developed any of my previous examples it would be hard to communicate with a family or participate in sports!. As you can see computers are not helpful for any society."	2344	
2345	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a negative effect on people such as being unhealthy, not enjoying the world, and spending time with family. My first reason why going on the @CAPS7 is a negative effect be because it is unhealthy. Would you rather stay in the house all day and never get an excercise? If you are on the @CAPS7 all day, you most likely are going to gain weight because you have to eat. Now you know why the @CAPS7 can make you unhealty. My next reason why the @CAPS7 is a negative effect is you won't be able to enjoy the world. You be so cought up with the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 that you won't have any time for yourself. I remember watching a show and the lady was on the @CAPS7 so much that she was scared to go outside. So. i think it is very important to enjoy world other than the @CAPS7. My last reason why computers have such a negative effect on people is because, people won't spend enough time with family. Many people won't spend time with there family because they are so obsessed with there new computers. My mom always says / ""@CAPS6 if it is the last time you seen me"". @CAPS6 if it was the last time you see your family? Would you rather stay home with your @CAPS7? or spend time with your family? now you know my final reason why computers are a negative effect. As you can see, Computers are a negative effect because, they are unhealthy, you won't have time to explore thw world, and you won't spend a lot of time with your family."	2345	
2346	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 is bliss. Computers give this to us and more. They give us useful skills, we get so much of our @CAPS1 from computers, and it helps us in our everyday life. Computers are very much a positive in our lives. We get so many useful skills from computers such as, hand-eye coordination. They're so many programs to help people read, write better, learn different languages and the list goes on. In fact, many people take online student classes for high school or college. This is very helpful for people who have kids, jobs or money problems. Computers gives us important @CAPS1. We have so much technology helping dotors and researchers find cures to harmful illnesses. Moreover, without computers it would make it hard to help cure people with illnesses. Schools everywhere in the world use computers because kids learn so much more at a faster rate, About @PERCENT1 of students who use computers for learning go to college. Almost every college out there gives their students: lab tops. Why would we want to take away @CAPS1 from our young people? Computers help people in their everyday life. Many people check the news, weather, and more. People can'@CAPS2 always get to a @CAPS2.V. so computer are there. People need to know whats going on around them. One time, I was online just surfing the web. I happen to check the weather, and there were big storm warnings. So I went out got things I needed like food, water and matches to be prepared. When the storm hit, I was well aware thanks to my computer. However a few people did in fact, get hurt. Computers are very helfful in life. Computers are very important in life for, they give us important skills, we learn so much because of it and they help us out in everyday life. So please join me in bring the positive effects of the great computer."	2346	
2347	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, More and more of my friends are beginning to use computers, and while many of them think it is beneficial and needed. I think it does not help society and can be a disdvantage to people in the modern day. For example, the computers people use are very time consuming and while they are the computers they are missing out on the opprtunity to play and get fresh air. Also, even though computers chane communication websites, you can't communicate face to face which is a needed skill when people are looking for jobs and when people are on computers they are missing out on enjoying nature. First off, everyone in the world needs exercise and it is what keeps them in shape that if people don't get at least on hour of excercise a day they can become overweight and get sick. If people are on computers @CAPS1 the time and everyday they will have no time for excercise and they will be in more danger of being sick or overwieght. Even though the computers is an advance piece of technology, you cant get your daily excercise from it, you need to actually, take the time and go outside to get thee excercise you need. Also a way people can get excercise is by playing sports. Sports because it doesn't only a way to get to know people, make new friends, and find your hidden talents. It is that @PERCENT1 people who play sports find what they want to do when they ate they finsl and know then what @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, I think that because people use not getting enough exercise. It is proven that the number one thing that people need as a skill when going for a job is communication skills and that will be hard to achieve if everyone is changing to communicate online because it is not the. For example, many jobs in the modern day need interactions between people and its is hard to interact with people. If you dont di it regularly. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 , I think computers are hurting society because people are not communicating face to face. Lastly, I think computers are non- benifical because while people are wasting time on the computer they are not enjoying the nature and the things around them. They are @CAPS1 too focused on the computers screen, not on the beauty of natures brings everyone. It is proven that @PERCENT2 pf people who enjoy nature are more happy and are not as depressed as others. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, I think that computers are wasting society because people are not getting fresh air and enjoying nature. In conclusion, the computers in our modern day can be very benefical because of the things it can do, but it is not as important as other things in our world."	2347	
2348	1	"I walked into the computer lab at school, and I saw all my classmates doing research for a project on the internet. I thought about how. I wouldn't even know how to do research for a project without the extremely convenient and easy internet. I think the efffects that computers have on us are not very good. Because of computers, we have cyber bullying I read an article about a girl named @PERSON1 who get cyber bullyed. @PERSON1 was on @CAPS1, a social networking site, and she get chated by these ""popular"" girls at school. The girls started making fun of her and saying lots of mean things to her. This continued happening for and finally. @PERSON1 got so fed up and started to believe the terrible things the girls said. @PERSON1 comitted suicide because of what these girls said. Those girls would never said than false things to @PERSON1's face. But they had the courage when they were able to hide behind their computer screens. @CAPS2 it for those effects that have, people would not be getting increased and bullyed over the internet. When people spent so much to not. There is this boy, in my class whos all of his going into the computer all of the he plays daily. He and therefore, he is overweight. @CAPS2 he didn't the computer as a I think get outside and some real games instead of th that he gets no out of. Computers in our society are a big of obesity in @LOCATION1. Children do not know how to do research without the internet. The first thing I think of when my teachers give me projects that require research is 'what website should I go on?' or 'I hope good sources come up on @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS2 I had to do all of my research by going to the library and looking thrugh books. I wouldn't know where to start. When we are given a resource such as the computer, people take advantage of it and don't know how to live without it. I think kids should learn how to use other resources (like books) instead of always relying on the internet. When I think of all the things the computer can do, I'm amazed! But computers have not helped us. In fact, they have done the exact opposite; they have hurt us. There is no way of recovering from all of this damage computers have done; but we can take it one step at a time, decreasing some of the technology that, is poluting lives, health, and edjucation. Computers do not have a positive effect on people, but we, as a country can change that."	2348	
2349	1	"Dear readers, I’m sure almost everyone out there has a computer. I understand that some people are concerned about the amount of time the average american spends on the web, but the computer is the key to a learning experience. The computer teaches us things such as hand-eye coordination and now even how to read! They give information on other people, places and cultures. The computer even lets us communicate with others. The computer is a learning tool. When people use it they’re learning hand-eye coordination. That skill later helps them do things like sports. With the advances in technology, the computer is becoming more helpful. In some cases it is how people learn to read. So don’t you see, the computer is a great thing for people to use? Information is always needed. The web can show you about people, places and cultures. In school we use computers for reports and projects. It is the fastest and easiest way to find information. If computers weren’t used as much as they are, students could be failing school. Adults also use the computer. Some jobs even require adults to be on a computer all day. The computer is a necessity. Communication is most important I know that people are worried because of online predators, but if you are informed on how to protect yourself them, then it’s ok. If we used computers then how could we talk to relatives and friends in other places who don’t have? Intelligent parents are letting their kids use computers for hours. It lets them learn to comunicate with others. I agree that at some point everyone should go and exercise and enjoy nature, but that doesn't have to give up the computer. It teaches us hand-eye coordination and how to read. Also it gives us information about almost everything. And finally because it lets us comunicate with others."	2349	
2350	1	"Dear local Newspaper I thik that people should spend half of the day on the computer on half with these family because they can start doin bad @CAPS1 example like they probaly stop exercising because all they wanna do is be on the computer alday. Is I was the person making the computer I would put something in it to go oof at a certain time like at nine o'clock. I think that if you wanna be on the computer can dont to nothing else than look at educated stuff on the computer I would make certain stuff be blocked on the computer. You can get fired from work because you can be up all night on the computer an go to work @NUM1 min late because you was tired @CAPS1 being on the computer all night an thats a big affect on your life @CAPS1 gettin fired because you was on the computer all night an if you have kids there gonna think that its ok to get fired from work because you was on the computer all night. If I put this in my life everyday I go on the computer after I do all that I gotta to do what I wanna @CAPS1 example like my homework, chores, shower, and eat then I just go on the computer @CAPS1 two hours then go to sleep and. Being in the computer alday can make you different you want know how to do educated stuff because all you wanna do is listen to music and be in chat rooms your gonna wanna drop out of skool cause you not gonna know the skool work you gonna know every song in the world but know skool work and thats why opion on people that like to be on the computer alday."	2350	
2351	1	"Most people say that other people spend to much time on the computer. This is only true sometimes. I think that computers teach hand-eye coordination and let you talk to friends and family in other places. I think computers benefits many people by letting them talk to their friends online. Another reason why computers benefits many people by letting people learn about things they are interested in. Lastly computers let you learn and to do better in school. Computers benefit people by letting them talk to family and friend. The benefit is that if you haven’t seen a family member in a long time, the computer lets you talk to them as much as you want. Another benefit is that if you just want to talk to them. Lastly is that if you need to talk to them and its very important that you talk to them. Computers benefit people in many ways. One way is that it helps you learn about things your interested in that helps you if you are interested in for example art. You can use the internet to research about art. Another thing is that if you are into other things the internet helps you learn about it. Computers benefit people in many ways. One way is that computers/internet help you learn and do better in school. The reason why that helps is that a student is doing bad in school. You can go one the internet and find places to help the student do better. I have told you a lot of reasons why computers help you. Those reasons are that the internet/computer let you talk to your friends and family. Another reason was that it helps you learn about things you are interested in. The last reason is that it helps you learn and do better in school. So I have told you all the reasons why computers help and benefit people."	2351	
2352	1	"The obesity level in the @LOCATION1 is rising rapidly. It has risen almost ten percent from last year. Today, computers are an enormous risk to both children and adults. Adults and children have started to @CAPS3 addicted by the computers. Computers have been affecting exercise time, family time, and knowledge. These are all negative consquences to both adults and children. A recent study has shown that more computers are being sold each year to both adults and children. Its great to @CAPS3 outside and enjoy the fresh air. Running around the fields playing tag, hide and seek, and frisbee are all fun activities you do outside. However, computers are starting to take this away from kids and adults. Everyday the obesity level is starting to rise. More and more kids are staying inside to go facebook, myspace, twitter, and to play games. These kids and adults come home from school or work and stay on the computer the rest of the @TIME1. Since their not exercising they are gaining wait. This is causing kids and adults to start going over weight and starting to reach obesity, when you exercise you feel good about yourself and when your obes you don't want to go out in public because of the way you look. Its fun to exercise with your friends. Join a team at school or @CAPS3 outside at least an hour a day. This will help you - stay in shape. If your having trouble losing wait watch your diet. Stay away from fatting foods like cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes. Make sure you eat fruits and vegetables. Spending time with your family is great. Watching the big game, playing outside, and talking are great ways to interact with your family. Now most kids dont even go downstairs to say ""hi"" because their to busy on the computer. While on the computer they miss out on having a couple laughs with the family. One day something might go wrong with a family. If you were on the computer you would feel guilty because you didn't even say hello to them. Its better to go downstairs and talk for a little, rather than hiding in your room playing on the computer. A recent study has been done at @ORGANIZATION1 saying that some kids don't even know who their @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are. Spending hours and hours a day on the computer isn't doing anything good about your education. In fact, its making you even dumber. Spending countless hours on the computer isn't going to @CAPS3 you far in life. Its fine to so on the computer for a little but @CAPS3 off and read a book. While on the computer your not learning anything from myspace, facebook, or twitter. These sites dont help you in anyway. Your brain will start to only focus on the computer and nothing else. President @PERSON1 has made many speeches about how computers affect your knowledge. ""@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day."" Exercising is great and can be fun. Cooking with mom and playing with dad will create special bonds. Losing knowledge isn't good. Exercising, spending time with the family, and knowledge are all negative consquences when computers come into play. If you have a computer at home make sure you stay away. Go outside, read a book, or go for a hike. These will all benefit you more than being a computer bum."	2352	
2353	1	"Dear newpaper, I am writing to you to tell you why computers are good to have. Computers are good to have because they have the ability to teach people about faraway places and people. It also teachs people hand-eye coordination, and it even allows people to talk on line with other people. Now getting into my letter, computers are good because they have the ability to teach people about faraways places and people. For a social studies project a couple of years ago that I did was about the southern part of @LOCATION1 and we did it on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION4, and we looked a lot of it on line and we learned lots of new things we didn't now before we did the project and if we didn't have computers it would be really hard to find all of that information. Now my second reason why computers are good is because they teach you the ability of hand-eye coordination. It teachs you hand-eye coordination because if you are typing a report or a paper you can watch the screen and you can type at the same time and if you watched your typing you probale mess up or hit the wrong key at the wrong time or hit a button that delets all of your work, and that would be bad all of your hard work gone, and if that happened to me I would be really upset. Now my last but not least the third reason why computers are good because they allow you to talk to your family, friends, or bisneuss coleges. My uncle moved to @LOCATION3 about six, seven years ago and I don't get to see him a lot so my dad sets up the video camera for the computers and we talk for a couple of hours just to catch up on all the things he as missed out on. So in the end computers are a good thing to have because they teach you about faraway places and people, it teaches you hand-eye coordination, and it allows you to talk to family, friends or bisneuss coleges."	2353	
2354	1	"To the local Newspaper Computers are so wired into our lives these days that without them we would be nothing. Computers are good things in our lives, they are positive machines that can help a persons communication, entertainment and one day maybe even a job. Computers are machines that if one day all disaphered, the human race would be caught on a state of confusion. Imagine life without a computer. It would not only communications from buisness to worker but also friends and family. Computers can enhance a persons learning. For a example, in schools computers are tools that are used to help with a child's learning or understanding. If I dont understand something the internet is where I go. It has everything right there for me. I can look up anything from persons of the to different animal spaces. That @MONTH1 seem lazy but the real thought is would I go out of my way t a to find one little or detail? I wouldn't have the time to do that and I don't think many other kids do either. Where would many of our classes go? Many kids are visual learners and a computer is a prime place to learn for them. For a example its much easier to see the effects of on a computer than a book. Its a lot easier to see the effects of on a than a book. Intell we find out has to put a video on a on a book, computers will be the best place to see things on action. What about on a computer. How could a student figure out where is place in a needed without a @NUM1-@CAPS1 model. A @NUM1-@CAPS1 something should look like when its finished. Then the communications. There are so many emails and it should be amazing to see then in one. How would a business notify that the. answer as a contract. Computers are would not way more than many people think. Thank you for listening to my opinions, I hope it will sway you thinking. "	2354	
2355	1	"Dear, Newspaper, @CAPS1 I think using the computer is a good thing, we are able to learn new things about places that we just cant go to. Another reason is that we can talk to our friends online. But most importantly we can know whats going on in the world. We can learn new things like the @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1, or like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @LOCATION2. There are so many things you can find out about places than having to get on a plane everyday to learn about the place. It is also good for reasearching for projects. this is one of the reasons why is we should use a computer. We can also talk to our friends online. lets say you have a friend that moves away and there is no way to talk to that person, with a computer you can talk to your friend still. It is also a good place to find out what homework you missed or just to talk and say hi. My last reason is that we know what is going on in the world. the computer is a @CAPS3 place to look up the news, weather, and sports. The computer keeps you up to date with the news. It also might tell you what big things people are doing like what the president does and some issues that are hapinng in the wrold today. This is why I think we should use computers."	2355	
2356	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have benefited society in a very good way. They can teach hand-eye coordination so that in the future you can type without having to look at the keyboard. Also you can do your home work and not have worry about your ""dog eating it"" or ""you accidently dropped it in your fire place"". It would be saved into your computer for later. @CAPS2 you need help with a class you can go to an online tutor for extra help on a school website. Computers also give you the advantage to learn about faraway places and people. You will be able to find directions to other places. For example: @CAPS2 you to find @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, travel @CAPS3 on @NUM1, turn on to the merrit parkaway and get off on exit @NUM2. Now people can learn about their great grandparents by going on websites that have your family tree. This is better than hearing stories that do not have all the information. Computers are now letting you chat online with your friends and family. You can use a webcam so you can see your friends and talk to them. Now people are playing online and you can meet your friends their and hang out. Lastly you can meet new friends around the world or even in your own town or city. All these reasons are why computers benefit today's society. We are advancing technology everyday so people can learn on computers. "	2356	
2357	1	"Dear local newspaper, Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on their computer and less time exercising. Well people who are on the computer all day everyday is techinaly exercising by using there fingers and eyes. It's not bad for little kids because you could have a program for the kids tohem. But than you have the adluts who just on it just because. It bad for everyone because the power the money is just being wasted. Then although if people are on the computer could go to exercising programs but no it's like these couch patotos they just don't want to move. What company should do is have a limte for how long a person has been on and maybe people might do the right thing. US people think the computers are good cause we could talk to new but then people forget there family. Being on the computer could also get you in alot of trouble like for example talk to some one and then they send threats. People say that you could bring your computer everywhere well in fact thats true. Now see everyone has a laptop thats portable and these no relgure compture they could always use the laptop. Laptops are good but it still stops are problems people on it all the time if these not at home, when your out side people still on it. What a way to make these people not use the computers? Well what the companys are going to have to do is put a timer on it then there a rest button that will tax you when ever you rest it again."	2357	
2358	1	"Dear newspaper, More than @PERCENT1 of the whole world supports technology and computers. People use it in their everyday lives. Using computers benefits the soceity. I teaches everyone new skills and gives hand-eye coordination. It also gives online resources like dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, atlases, and many others. In addition, it gives people a way to communicate and share ideas. Computers are an everyday resource and without them nobody would be as educated and without them nobody would be as educated and advanced as the world is. First of all, they teach people that they can use throughout their life. When people use the mouse to move the screen with their eyes, creating hand-eye coordination. Also, it teaches people facts an skills like to read and write. To use a computer and know how to read and write, but if they don't the computer has many programs to teach people. It also allows typing which makes writing neater and for most people can be done faster. The computer is a useful fool to teaching people everyday skills. Secondly, the computer has many online resources. It has dictionaries to look meaning or spelling of a word, the to improve vocabulary and find synonyms for words, encyclopedia to learn additional information on topic, people, places, structures, or others, and many other resources. It helps people expand their knowledge and learn information about history, people they are to meet, places they are unable to go or things they would see computers widen people knowledge and allow them to experience for themselves. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate and share information or ideas. There are many different programs that allow people to chat privately pr publicly. They have places to share opinions or ideas and places to meet people. Nowadays there are many people meeting friends online. Also, if people discover new information or have new ideas they can share it with the world in a fast easy way. Overall, computers are a useful form of communication. In conclusion, computers are useful tools that can benifit peoples everyday life and the society. They teach people newskills and supply them with new knowledge and also serve as helpful resources to find new or reinforce information. Also they are a new, modern more advanced and quicker way to share information with people all around the world. So clearly the computers are very helpful to people all around the world and they can benefit the society."	2358	
2359	1	"Dear local newspaper, I don't think that the computors benifit society. Computors take away time from; family and friends, forms obesity,and less time for excercising. As a result of, the computor, it has tooken time away from family and friends. If everybody is always on the computor everybody would be bored if they had time with their family. Also people would be bored all the time from not being on the computor. When you're on the computor you can't hang out with a friend. So, there will not be as @MONTH1 friends if everybody is on the computor @NUM1. Compared to family and friends obesity is a very very big issue in the @LOCATION1. In fact is, when you are side tracked you double the amount you normally would. A scientific fact is that when your stomach is full and you eat more than your stomach holds it will grow bigger. Obesity is caused by eating and you sometimes eat when you are doing nothing or are bored. I relize, you have read this letter so far, so I will say excercising is the @CAPS1 important thing to do in life. Even if, you are not obese you still want to excercise to keep yourself in shape. Excercising is good for you so don't delay on it. Excercising is: fun, exciting, keeps blood moving, energizing, and best of all, you can do it with friends! I have no idea about who's reading this, but I love nature! I could go outside for hours on end in the sun without stopeng. Nature is good for you and animals. Do you have a dog? Well, I know for a fact dogs love walking too. To rap this letter up I want to say, that computors definitly do not benifit society! For reasons like friends and family, obesity, and excercising."	2359	
2360	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers benefit society and have a positive effect on people in everyday life. As a student, it helps not just me, but others with school work, learning about faraway places, and even lets you talk to friends online. Let me elaborate more on these ideas. Although you @MONTH1 think doing homework on the computer is wrong, it can be very useful. In @CAPS1 class, we have vocab every week. Instead of looking in the dictionary and searching for the definition, we could just go on the internet. It saves time and effort. Also, when you are trying to write an essay for collage, or any other reason, it would look more professinal and neat typed rather than written on lined paper. Furthermore, you can learn about exotic places and famous people you have never been to or met before. Computers give you a chance to feel that adventure! You can see pictures of famous sites and even book an flight to go there with people on the internet, you can find the newest gossip about them. Also, you can even find out where and when a famous singer is going to have a concert. As you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are popular chatting sites. They give people a chance to communicate. My cousin lives in @LOCATION1, so I could never see her, but because of the computer, I can catch up on special events that happened in our family. A study showed that students have better relationship with their friends than to students who don't use the computer. To sum it up, I think now you could agree that computer benefit the society. They help students with school work, let you have better knowledge of places and people, and help have a stronger connection with relatives and friends. Please take all these ideas into concideration."	2360	
2361	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard in our school newspaper that some people think having computers is a bad idea. @PERCENT1 of computers owners say that this is not true. @NUM1 of @NUM2 graders say computers have helped them a lot. In my opinion having computers is a good idea. First, having computers is a good idea because it teaches hand-eye coordination. All the time you spend on your computer typing will benefit you. It will benefit you because while you are typing, you are also teaching yourself hand-eye coordination. This will help you later in life. And the you become better. And it is great to have excellent hand-eye coordination. Scientists did a test and the results showned that when you have better hand-eye coordination it helps with lots of things. In conclusion, having a computer is a good idea because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Secondly, having a computer is a good idea because it gives people the ability to learn about different places. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 lets you see @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, the moon, and the constilations. It also has a flight simulates. On computer you can learn new languages or a sentences to any language. I remember one time when I bad to surly and do a report on a country. I was @NUM3 grade and I @CAPS3 @CAPS4. This really tought me me a lot. In conclusion having a computer is a good idea because it gives people the ability to learn about different places. Lastly, having a computer is a good idea because it allows people to chat with friends. For example, @CAPS5, I have a @CAPS6 and I have about @PERCENT2 friends on it. I spend on the @CAPS5 talking to friends. It really helps with with typing tem. On it I get in of things, and even when I am absent from school I get the homework. @PERSON1, a therapy, says that kids relieve stress when they chat online with example. In conclusion, having a computer is a good because it allows people to chat with friends. To conclusion, having a computer is a good idea. A good idea because it teaches kids hand-eye coordination. Also it gives people the ability to learn about different places. And it people to chat with friends. Hopefully this provedes you to put this is the paper. The fate as people knowledge about computers is in your hands."	2361	
2362	1	"People spend way to much time on the computers. There are many things that make people lazy and not excersize such as @CAPS1.V. to video games but I think the computer is the worst one. When people are spending their time on the computer it is turning off your brains and your bodys causing you to not wanna do things for the rest of the day. There are also ways to chat with friends online where you just sit there and type when really you could be out doing something active with that friend. Lots of kids like to play games on the computers these games can be addicting and cause kids to want to do nothing else but play there games on the computer just like how some people like to watch @CAPS1.V. the time. I do think computers are a good thing when used appropriately, teachers can use computers for grading, typing up notes for their students. Kids can also use computers for there school work such as a typed out project a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and @CAPS6-mailing teachers. All the time People are spending on the computer using @LOCATION1M, @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter they could be spending time with their familys, doing their favorite activities such as @CAPS8, soccer, field hockey, baseball, ice hockey, exct. or hanging out with friends. Nowadays lots of people have cell phones anyways so if it is important that they talk to someone, instead of spending all that time on the website they use they can simply call or text someone while doing something fun and active outside. Computers should be used for school work and research only because those are things you need to get done but other that that kids should rarely use the computer and get more excersize. People should cut back on how often they use computers."	2362	
2363	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a conflict going around about computers being a help in socity or hurting socity. I was told to wright a letter to my local newspaper aboutt my opinion on this argument. My opinion is that computers help socity. Computers helps socity because they teach us nit only hand-eye coordination but about abot what is happening in town or any where in the world if we didn't have computers life as we wouldn't where we are today. What mean by thout is we wouldn't know how to make life like @NUM1 diagrams to exat proportions for example when people dasign building or what not they first draw it out then they make the blue prints and final disign or the computer. Also bosness wouldn't be the way thyere because without computers @CAPS1 would be no websites with no websites computers would have to rely on newspaper and customers word. Secondly people would not know other people places. If people didnt have computers to know people @NUM2 other places @CAPS1 might be people might ask ""how is that possable"" so will explain. Computers let people interact with her and if we couldn't talk to people of her then we couldn't realy got a good or of what that place is like to go @CAPS1. Also you would have to go to the airport or call to book a ticket. With the help of computers we can book a flight online. Lastly, computers can help people get to know each other. for example, facebook, facebook lets people get to talk without a phone so you can see money on your phone bill, websites like facebook lets them communicate. Now that I stated some of the meny ways computers help, I would like to thank you for your time reading this paper."	2363	
2364	1	"Dear local newspaper, I support advances in technology. I support because people can talk online, make easy payments, and teach people. All of this can be done with one peice of advanced technology that is used all over the world. One reason is that people can talk online. You can talk to anyone you know. For example, you can talk online with far away family members, faraway friends or just friends you never get to talk to. In example, people can talk online with people the don't get to see very often using the advanced technology we have @DATE1. Another advantage with advanced technology that people have is the advantage to make easy payments online. For example, people @DATE1 shop online, pay bills online, and even pay insurance. Many people @DATE1 use the internet for making payments, seeing it as an easier way for them. As a result, making payments online is easier than doing what we did without advanced technology. Another thing people use our advanced technology for is learning. People learn how to fix a problem with their computer, how to make or build a certain thing, and even help with acedemic studies. In example, they can learn more about math, science, social studies, gramar, ect. As a result, people learn from advanced technology without having trouble understanding what they are tryin to learn. In conclusion, there are many advantages for people with the advanced technology we use @DATE1.Those advantages are talking with people from faraway, making easy payments online, and having a better learning experience.As a result, I support advanced technology because it makes peoples lives easier for them."	2364	
2365	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the late @DATE1 and has been around, ever since. It's the computer. I think that the computer has a positive effect on our society. It helps us gain more knowledge, have easier communication, and helps hand-eye coordination. In the following paragraphs I will expand on these reasons. Science, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, etc any topic you name the computer knows it. In fact it has been proven the computer itself can teach you more in one week than a three week college course! We wouldn't want to take away such a wonderful oppurtunity to expand on or knowledge,would we? My uncle an infectus disease doctor told me he has found a diganoses for many of his patients because of research he has done online. With forty percent of scientists and doctors admitting a lot of their knowledge came from the computer I think it is pretty clear how important the computer really is. It has already helped us find cures, diganoses, treatment, and much more..who knows what other areas it will one day help us in. Saying goodbye to someone you arent going to see for awhile that you love isn't any one's favorite thing to do. Luckily, with computers you don't have to! The computer offers hundreds of ways to communicate with others no matter how far away. Worldwide communication has imcreased ninety-four percent since the computer was @CAPS1! Now that's a lot! You can video chat, voice chat, email, instant massage, facebook, and, much more to communicate. The other day when my sister went back to college we missed each other so much we video chatted that very night! It was like he was practically in the room! With computers you don't have to wait on long to see or talk to the ones you miss. According to the . Today's the @CAPS3.S the top neuro suregeons in the world. Fifty percent said they thanked computers for their great hand eye coordination. Typing without looking is one of the best ways to improve your hand-eye coordination. My very own doctor told me one very important skill every surgeon must have is good hand-eye coordination. I think we have computers to thank for this. As you can see computers are very important and helpful to our society. Where would we be without them? We certainly wouldn't have as much knowledge, communication, or as good hand-eye coordination as we do today. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and our society."	2365	
2366	1	"Dear local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are an iseue. Have you ever thought that computers are eating away at the little life you have? Yes computers are good for projects and websites But these days people are using them for unnesesary purposes, such as facebook or twitter, webcams, and computer texting. So meny ways of communicating and people end up rellying on computers. I love facebook (who do eat?) and I feel it's like an extencion of school with out the learning. You get to see and talk to all your friends and play internet games to conect chatrooms and such but one of the most simple resons there on facebook and twitter in the first place is because they dont and or can't hang out with there friends at home. So if our parents would give us more freedome on school days we woulden't be online. Another ishue worth adressing is webcames I under stand if we don't want friends over but webcames is a way of being lazzy and on computers. well without webcame we get more active like walking around or playing games and with webcames you sit there and talk while & camra watches your every move. One last thing I want to tell you guys about is computer texting. If you have an e-mail, like me you can get free texting and send a mesage to any phone you want so you are texting wile your brain is stick on the computer screen. I say just call them and work up your comunication tecniqes. Well now you know why computers are such a big isue. facebook and twitter are a manet to children, webcames just watch you, and computer texting is a new low on texting so to finally solve all this all parents should let the kids have friends over a lot mote than they do now. thanks for lisining,"	2366

2368	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 more and more people use computers, but I think that it doesn't benefit out society. Most people believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but they don't look on the negative effects. Experts believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. What side are you on? Spending too much time on the computer @MONTH1 seem fun and all, but you won't @CAPS2 all the exercise you need. If you don't exercise you're most likely going to @CAPS2 love handles or a tire in your stomach. Going on the computer a lot will make you become addicted. Addiction is wehre you become dependent on it and when you want to stop, it's hard to quit. You also won't @CAPS2 enough sleep because of online chatting. Sure, it's easier to do than calling that person, but the more online chatting you do the longer you do it. You want to stay up because you want to keep talking to that person. Is this really the type of lie you want? ""@CAPS2 off the computer! Look around you! Go enjoy nature! "" is what a lot of parents say to their computer addicted kids. But really look around you outside. Nature is amazing. Going on a hike up mountain sure is hard but you'll @CAPS2 the exercise you need and the sight is amazing. Which brings me to my next point. There are more jaw-dropping things in nature than a gossip column story. Really! us kids need fresh air @CAPS1, so @CAPS2 out and play an hour a day! The last point of my opinion is you interact less with your friends and family members. Your friends will stop inviting you over because you'll seem distracted because of drama you got yourself into and they want to spend time with you not snap their fingers in front of your face. Your family an friends all want to spend time with you, but all you want to do is talk to people on the computer. You'll lose some friends becasue you interact less with them. Friends want to spend time with friends! Is this really how you want to live? Although the computer @MONTH1 be fun and easier way to access information it will always have cons. to become less addicted to it cut your hours shorter. Don't be addicted! @CAPS2 out and play! Enjoy nature!"	2368	
2369	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION5. In response to the recent debate regarding the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people, I believe that computers are a real benefit to society. Computers can do things that people, can't, people can learn about all sorts @ORGANIZATION1 thing, and people can communicate with others regardless @ORGANIZATION1 ther location. Computers, insome ways, are more intelligent than humas. The @ORGANIZATION3. recently had an article explaining the sudden increase in car production. The article said that the car making industry experienced a @PERCENT1 spike in production because robots programmed by computers are building cars at a greater rate than humans. Though the process the companies are making more cars thus making them cheaper for people. @PERSON3 is a proffesor @ORGANIZATION1 neurosurgery at the @ORGANIZATION1 and he belives that in @NUM1 years @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 surgeries will be conducted by robots. These machines are more preuse than humans, thust the survival rate @ORGANIZATION1 surgery will goup. Computers will probably be called upon in the future to perform tasks that are simply too difficult for humans. Computers contain an extremly vast wealth @ORGANIZATION1 information. @PERSON1 is the super @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS2 public schools and he is working on a proposal to get rid @ORGANIZATION1 the books in the libray and put computers in their place. If you need to know the capital @ORGANIZATION1 singapore or the author @ORGANIZATION1, you can do so very quickly if you have computer to use to your. @PERSON2 is the head librarian at the @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION6 and he states that by the time the, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 will be dominated by computers one @MONTH1 see computers to anyone who needs good information fast.

2370	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 regester, @CAPS3 writing this letter because I think coumputers are the besty invenstion a person as ever made. My frist reason why I think computers is the best invenstion a person has ever made because it keep kids from going outside and geting into problems. My second reason is it will hepl people learn about are country and what's going on in different countrys. My last reason is you could talk with people around the would. My first reason why computers are the best invention a person has evere made because it will keep kids from going outside and geting them selfs into problem with a on there people. I think this because in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it all about were you from who you hang with and what you repe. For example you sure just walking in a nigberhoud and you not from there end people know you not from there they will rode you or just shout you because you are not from there that why computer is a great invention because it will keep your kid from making that mistuk. My second reason why computers are a great invention because it helps people learn more about we would and with going on in different contrys. For example you have a school project on how we got @ORGANIZATION1 and you don't know all you have to do is to tipy in that gueston and it will tell you all the answer on how we got our country end and more. My last reason why coumputers is a great invenvsoion because you could talk to people around the world with out knowing them. For example @CAPS4, myspace and more all those websites help you talk end make friend overe the wed without calling them end texting them end even make friends that live in a diffirent country and even askinf them guestion that is there country diffirent or to your country and even if it's a good place to vesit. That why we neend computers. In cunclution, @CAPS5 are great for people to have. one reason why it will help kids from going outside end geting it to problems. Second reason is it will hlep people learn more about are country end diffirent country. The last reason is you could talk to people around the world."	2370	
2371	1	"Are computers good or bad? More and more people each day are becoming addicted to the internet. Some people love it. Although, some people disagree, and are against it. Is the internet really making people go against nature? No. I, for one, think the computer is a great device. It lets you talk to friends, learn about the world, and even make new friends. Search engines like ""google"" or ""yahoo"" are a great way to find out information. Someone can look up to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, good restaurants, or even music videos. Anything you think of, the internet probably has information on it. It's almost like a personal library. One thing people love is friends. The internet is a great way to connect with friends. There's e-mail, instant messengers, and various other sites that allow you to talk to your friends. You can discuss whatever you want, without being in the same room. The possibilities are endless. Then there's other countries. The internet is a great way to find out about places you've never been to. This brings up the search engines and other people again. All you have to do is search for a certain place. Let's say you want to see what @LOCATION1 is like. Type in ""@LOCATION1,"" and you get tons of pictures and information on @LOCATION1. You can also meet people from other countries. You can talk to them, befriend them, and ask questions about their culture, language, customs, and more. The computer is a very helpful thing to have. It's not always a cure all for boredom and laziness. As for the lack of exercise, that's not the computers fault. That's the person's fault. It is possible to enjoy the internet and nature, friends, and family. You just have to want to."	2371	
2372	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think that computers are very useful. I think this because you can communicate with friends, find out what's going on in the world and find @CAPS1 ways to exercise. These are all things that you could do without a computer, but it's a faster way to find it. This makes more time in the day to do other activities. Friends are important to us, so we try to talk to them as much as possible. This gives us reason to talk to them. You also might be able to find friends on the internet that you might've known from high school or elementary school. This way you can see if they are married, have kids, or what they are doing for a living. As a result, you can keep in touch with them. You can find out sports scores, breaking news, laws being passed; or even @CAPS1 jobs, @CAPS1 schools, info about history. The internet has basiacally everything on there. The internet has activities for all ages: kids, teens, adults, and elderly. You can find out about good restraunts, good gyms, anything that might be advertised. As a result, the internet is also a good marketing place. Some people say that we aren't getting enough exercise. Yet, if they didn't have time to exercise they wouldn't be able to have time to work. Most people are walking around all day anyway. You cant find healthy food online, exercise equipment gyms, how to do an exercise the right way, you can find ways to cook food healthier. The internet is also used for ways to find how long an average person should be working out/exercising. As a result, people who say we don't exercise enough are wrong because they (the people using the internet) are usually using it to buy exercise products. The internet is also used to keep track of stocks, big companies, and many other features used in business. This is what some people do for a living so they sit a computer all day but they still get exercise; they are using/exercising their fingers. Therefore, they have nothing else to do until the get off their shift. Besides, most people are using their smart phones for the internet so they could be exercising and using the internet at the same time. This means that they could go on the internet anywhere and be doing something else instead of using their phone (unless they get updates)."	2372	
2373	1	"I believe that computers are used way too much. Many people across the world, are becoming obese and out of shape, People are relying on the internet to contact eact other. What happens when technology fails? Also prosle are forgetting how to speak and act in the real world. Computers do many good things. most of these things are advertised, but what you don't see advertised is all the harmful things they do to you. I don't know of a person who is not sitting on their rear-end while using a computer. People are most likely on the computer for around an hour or more. So sitting down this entire time could have potential to run your posture. And cause back problems. Also when someone is on the computer they are not exerzising like they could be and should be. The average person wands to live a healthy lifestyle and look good right. Well sitting at your computer for that hour you could have been excercising is not going to help you achieve that goal. Another point I'd like to being us is that many people rely on e-mail ad internet to contact each other. Well, what happens when technology fails @CAPS1 sometime it will, And lots of people will be lost. If a sports coach cancels practice @PERSON1 for some doesn't spend or a few parents can't or don't have the opportunity to check their e-mail, they and there children will be left there wondering where everyone is, @CAPS2 is something I've noticed around me. Since students and adults talk on the internet so much, they really forget how to talk and act in society. This could pose as a major problem for a business man or spokesperson giving a speech. Or a salesman might lose a sale @CAPS1 he treated the customer with disrespect due to the fact that he just did not how to talk to the man. On the younger side of this teens use the @NUM1internet to talk a lot, when they get into a real life situation they won't know how to go about it or handle it, this making it awkward. In conclusion, I think that in a way computers are ruining society, They are a major contribution obesity and lack of exercise, they are heavely relied for communication, and lastl, they can manipulate the way you speak and act in society."	2373	
2374	1	"Computers have pro-and-con effects on our society. Many people believe that computers have a major positive effect on our country, yet some people believe that computers have a major negative effect on others. It is important to know that computers do improve hand-eye coordination and can be used for educational use. However, there needs to be some physical activities in each person's day. Each of these topics are the pros-and-cons of the debates experts discuss and argue on. Hand-eye coordination is a positive effect from computers. When a person types words up using both hands all fingers they are improving hand-eye coordination. Musicians need very good hand-eye coordination. They can't look at the notes and fingers at the same time, they need to look at the notes without checking what they are pressing. Musicians can improve their hand-eye coordination by using computers. Computers are not just for socializing or improving you typing skills. Students need to use computers for educational uses more often. As technology changes, students are expected to do well in school to open doors in the future. Doing well in school means to follow direction. Study for tests, and create good projects with good information. Students must find good information through books. However, what happens when you can't have access to books (can't drive to library, parents are too busy, library is closed, etc.)? Maybe use a computer. Retrieving information is free. You do not have to borrow a website. People are able to do their projects using a computer. This is another benefit from using computers. There are negative effects from using a computer. Over use @MONTH1 cause obesity and might keep people from doing physical activities during their day. It is important to do very little socializing and other unimportant things on a computer. The percentage of obese people has gone up. this @MONTH1 be because of the over use of technology. So it is very important to do more exercise and less unimportant things on a computer. Computer both benefit and don't benefit our society. Beneficial topics computers do are improving hand-eye coordination and educational uses. Non-beneficial topics are the over use of computers. however, computers seem to benefit our society more than they don't."	2374	
2375	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers have been a great addition to out technology. The computer can teach @CAPS2 people, different things. This wonderful addition has a great effect on people, like how you can socialize with people. Also instead of waiting for the news to come on @CAPS1 you can almost intantly have any news you want. The computer can do @CAPS2 different things. One is that you can learn things without knowing it like hand eye coordination. Also if you have to research some one for a project you could use books. But if the person is relatively new they might not have something about them in a book. Thats where the internet comes in. Also you @MONTH1 want to plan a trip and you dont want to call the annoying automated machine. You wont have to do anything on the phone with the internet. This is how usefull the internet is. You @MONTH1 be saying most people spend too much time can the computer. And if you don't have enough self control you can get special chip that allows you on the internet for a certain amount of time. The internet is every powerful thing. You can chat with other people no matter how far away. If you both true a web cam then you could chat and even see the person even if they are on the other side of the world. There are also some sites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 that you could socialy know whats going on with people. And if your feeling down you cold past something. Even though most people who have an can see this you will feel better about venting you feeling and less frustrated. Lets say you planned a trip to @LOCATION1. you want to know what the weather is. Instead of waiting for the @NUM1 clock news, you can go on the internet and instantly know. Something with the news if ou are impatient and heard of new news you can look up instead of baging a newspaper. The internet can have books magazines and news papers online, so that saves trees which helps the earth. The internet is an amazing thing that most people take for granted. In conclusion you man learn things knowing it and not knowing it. You are learning to type and about around the world. You my also he update with you social life and talk to people you havent seen in a while. You can also know the news when ever you want before or even often shows on @CAPS1. You can do this all with the click of a mouse!! How amazing.!"	2375

As kids get these games they get hooked on it then they never come out of there room. My brother had a friend who played one of these games he used to be a really fit kid but now these games changed hislife. There is this one game that come out around like @DATE1 and I saw that @NUM1 million kids play this game. Those @NUM1 million kids will have a very short life because they dont come out of there room and all they eat is junk food. This has a huge effect on them they forgot about the outside world. I worry about these kids because they are throwing there life away. But of course I cant do anything about it because I am only a thirteen year old for gosh sake!! I have some examples and I want to share them with you. I decided to go on the website and create a ten day trial. I did this because I wanted to interview someone who I start interviewing him and he says he has a @NUM3 level @NUM4's and is the highest you can go. Now he must have a great life knowing that he played this game his whole life. My second example that I like to tell you is that one of my older brothers best friend loved nature it was his favorite thing to see. Untill one day he played this game and he played it all day and all night. He didnt realize what he was doing to himself till he got on a scale and weighed himself. Finally my last example that I would like to share with you is that this game is like nicotine. This game has @NUM1 million kids playing it and it just keeps going up. Kids are forgetting how fun the out doors are. If their parents take away these kids computer they would think that there life is ending. Now that is pathectic!! In conclusion I think that this game should be banned. The only reason why I'm saying this is because I dont want these kids to end up like my brothers friend. They can live such good lives if they want to. They could start by stop playing the game and setting a grip of themselves."	2376	
2377	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 of people are starting to use computers. Some support the advances in technology and believe computers have a possitive role in society. Others think computers aren't that great for us. I gave this a little thought and decided to go along with the experts that say computers are bad. People who use computers spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Let me explain more about why computers have a negative effect on people. As I said, boys and girls in the @LOCATION1 that spend a lot of time on the computers don't get enough exercise. They would rather stay on the laptop than to go outside for a while and run or shoot some. Instead of getting the daily exercise they spend their day after school playing games and goind on emails and other websites. We can all assume that this is one of the many causes why children in our country are overweight and obese. If kids spent more time outside playing with friends then they would be healthier and happier people. Another reason why I think computer arent good is that people miss the beautiful nature everyday. Staying home on the internet in a closed room with no air isn't healthy for us. If there wasn't any computer then humans would go outside, enjoy the fresh air outside and notice the amazing trees, grass, and animals that are in the environment. You should look at the nature everyday and remember how beautiful it really is. However, with computers these days people are prevented from going outside and seeing everything that surrounds us. This is another factor that plays a major role with why people aren't healthy. Instead of interacting with family and friends you interact with a computer. Some people play games and get addicted to them. Soon, they start to stop going ""to work or school. Then, your parents get angry for skipping school and not getting good grades. If they keep it up students will not pass a grade and will need to stay back another year. If adults get addicted is a computer they will eventually lose their jobs and end up losing their home for not being able to pay off taxes and mortgages. They will stop talking with family and not have a strong bond anymore. The relationshop with friends will not be as strong and you will be by yourself. Some people that can't interact with their community end up being alone because of the internet. You wouldn't want people to end up like this in you family. In conclusion, I hope I have taught you many of the reasons why I strongly believe computers are not good for people. They prevent us from exercising, getting fresh air, and interacting with family and friends. More and more people use computers now and our community is breaking apart. I hope I have convinced you to agree with me and please consider to think the some way I do. "	2377	
2378	1	"Dear @CAPS1, In this @DATE1, computors are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. It seems as though people, especially teenagers, have a fetish with this technology. Some try to claim that this as a good thing, however, people have to stop and realize that it is not. A mere twenty years ago, when children got home from school they would go outside and play until it got dark. Now children go home and stare at computor screen until their parents kick them off. This unhealthy and studies show that as the number of computors in the @LOCATION1 rises so does the number of obese children. This issue also effects adults, who spend time updating their facebook status rather than taking a walk. If people continue to use computors lengthy amounts of time, health problems will continue to grow. The excuses people concact to explain their obsessions with computors are extraordinarily fable. For instance, people say that computors help improve hand eye coordination. However, playing sports such as tennis would do the same thing, but while improving your physical at the same time. Also, many on the computors give them the chance to foreign cultures; but the truth is books or documentation recource for . Finally, people enjoy the way computors allow you to with people; but no smiley faces typed into a text box can replace the sounds of human emotion you when you talk with someone on th phone. There are a few examples of there is enjoy a alternations to computors. Humans going on the computor all time deprives us of the chance to talk with others in person. There was one woman who became so obessed with a facebook game that she neglected her family. It became so bad that she cared more about growing virtual plants than making her children dinner. Also, if your playing computor games rathen than playing with your friends, you aren't getting the socialization humans need. One day your life will flash before your eyes, is a computor screen all you really want to see?"	2378	
2379	1	Well I think that using computers help some people in different ways and also it can be a fun positive hobby. But I dont think that being on a computer all day is good for you and it also can be very addicting to some people. But to me computers are fun and I think if you be on computers to much you should take a brake. And equal it out like doing other stuff or have other hobbys or even just try new things. Goin outside can be one enjoying nature can be another those are stuff you can do computers and nature sounds nice to me but I dont think banning nature or computers is good try both is my opinion.	2379	
2380	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some experts and some everyday people are starting to belive that computers have a negative effect on people. I do not belive this. Computers are very important. They help people learn to read write or even how to make @NUM1 equal @NUM2! There are even online colleges. Computers also help many students write an essay. I have written many essays on the computer. I even find my reaserch for an essay on the computer. A computer is an excellent source of comunication. Wether if your on facebook talking to a friend or sending an important document through e-mail. Big and smart buisness even use the internet for advertizing or to hire @ORGANIZATION1 employes. The goverment even uses @CAPS1 to post the presidents speech's if you missed them. You can also wath the super bowl doritos commercial's. Computers have many diffrent application type things. You can type a paper on microsoft word or try, to beat your dad's highscore in pinball. Computers were used to make the movie @CAPS2 one of the best movies of the year! Even I can go home and make one the most watched video on @CAPS1 on the computer. And my dad's tryingto beat my highscore in pinball. You guys at @ORGANIZATION1 use computers everyday! To write the story then post it to your website. That's why computers are good things not bad! So how would a computer have a negative effect on you if a computer tought you how to read or if you beat your dads high score in pin ball, and that at essay you wrote yea you probably typed it on a computer."	2380	
2382	1	"Ever since they were invented, computers have been growing in popularity throughout the world. First, the amount of overweight and obise people has grown dramticly in the @DATE1. This could be because they are spending to much time on their computers and not enough time exercising. Also, because of computers, everyone is not enjoying nature as much. Lastly, the computer distracts people from seeing their family and friends. Therefore, computers are not a benefit to society. People spend too much time on computers and not enough time exercising. Exercising is necisary to maintain and good health. In @LOCATION1, more peole are getting sick because they have a low imune sysytem. getting off your computers and exercising would make the world a healthier place. Next, teens don't always get the exercise they need because of computers. The aversge teen spends @PERCENT1 of his/her day on a computer. If they could cut back and exercise more, they would get the exercise that they need. Another nreason computers do not benefit society is because they limit people from enjoying nature. Sitting in a dark room with the computer as your only light is not a good way to live. Going outside and enjoying sunlight. You can enjoy nature and get and next people spend long periods of time on the computer looking at pictures of places like rainforests. Why not plan a vacation and go there? Being outside in and around nature is very enjoyable. Lastly, even if it os hard for you to stop using the computer, go outside a little bit every day. Eventually you will be able to fully enjoy nature wihtout the distraction of computers. The @DATE1 reason computers are not a benefit to society is because they cause people to spend less time with their family and friends. Some say that the computer is a good thing and allows you to socially interact with friends and family over the internet. Actually seeing them in person is much better than typing to them on a computer. Plan to have lunch together so you can spend more time with your family. Right away you will realize that this is much better than chatting to them on a computer. Over all computers have a negative effect on people. They limit the amount of exercise that people get they don't enjoy nature as much and they spend less time with family and friends. This is why computers hurt society and not help it. "	2382	
4778	2	"Do u believe there are books, music, magizines, and movies in are libaries? These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could  we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach.     First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended.          Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere.  In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people.     The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go.     Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see"	6578	6579
4779	2	"I strongly believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things.     When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library.     You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future. If a child went into a library and began reading a book about drugs it could hurt their future. If the book was telling them that drugs aren't always bad, then that kid @MONTH1 grow up thinking it is okay to do drugs. This could really ruin someones life. I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases.      If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves.      I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries. I hope that most would agree that no one should have to see these offensive books when they enter a library."	6580	6581
4780	2	"Do you think that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves in a library if found offensive?Sometimes they should if found offensive by alot of people.Sometimes books are found offensive by a few people and the books should not be band. Sometimes books are found offensive by alot of people and they should be band.Sometimes no matter what library's do not band the books.     We have freedom to keep those books in the library.We also have the freedom to say what is offensive to us in those   books .wh should band some books and some should not be band. some people think we should band books .i think books should be band too because they can be found offensive to some people.     They @MONTH1 be offended by racist things in books.Murder books they @MONTH1 take offensive.Books about @CAPS1 they @MONTH1 take offenive.If i had a young daughter i would not read this stuff at all. Because she does not need to be reading those books.     Little kids do not need to be reading that bad books.I thinks that all little boys and girls should not read those things. They should stay sweet and inisent. Young boys and girls should read books for little kids. Little kid books are for kids and the other books are for adults.     We should band some books because they can be found offensive to some people.  Some people do not like to be offended. Some people are not offended. Books that people find offensive should be band and those books should not be read."	6582	6583
4781	2	"Censorship in libraries should definetly be allowed. It is history for everyone in the world to know. Sure it @MONTH1 bug some people that stuff like that is being written about them; however, they probably read material about you like that as well. How is that fair? Words in the library are just people's opinions about other people, groups, or other things.      Sure there are facts about what that group or person did, but that's history. People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to blacks, but now that people have read about it and what it caused, they realize how inhumane and bad it is. It's necesarry information to learn. People who get mad at libraries for carrying that material in their books just can't let go of the past or they care too much about what other people think.     As far as movies and music go, they are just informative videos about @LOCATION1's history, and music is for entertainment. You can't take all things you see hear in a literal way. They are not meant to be taken in an 'in your face' sort of way. It's not like there isn't another movie out there making fun of the one that offended you. Libraries carry this reading/learning material to help inform the less than average person or the more than average so they can both become smarter.       Libraries aren't made to make people angry about what some guy thought or said once. It is just a place to gain knowledge. If you don't want to let your child have access to information like that then I suggest that you don't let them go to the library ever. That's is what it was made for and will always be made for. Yeah the person who wrote that book or movie @MONTH1 not have gotten their information from a reliable source and said some false things about a group or person. It happens. But they are stilling trying to educate the reader. Education is what makes our world survive. We have to keep learning and the library makes that oppurtunity available with all the information it holds.      Libraries should keep every book that they have. If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people. So do what you do best and keep writing stories you hear about in the news or anywhere. It's good information that is informative."	6584	6585
4782	2	"Many books are helpful as you @MONTH1 know by now, but taking away books that are found, 'offensive' is repulsive. I believe that these books, movies, music, magazines, should be kept on the shelves. There are many reasons for keeping these books for the public, one main one is that who ever has a membership to the library paid to see everything.     These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska.     As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it.     Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life. So holding books back just because a group of peoples opinion is outragous! This is a free country and we should be able to know that by not having people hide stuff just because a slight offense is brought into play.     This is my opinion on this matter and some @MONTH1 take offense to it, just hear me out when i say why let someone tell you what you can and cant read? Thats just wrong. Thank you for taking time to read what i had to say about this matter, and just understand the right to opinnions and how everyone has one and will express it."	6586	6587
4783	2	"Should good books be taken off the shelf because their not appropriate for @PERSON1 children? Should libraries be only child friendly? Censorship in public libraries isn't the answer to solve the problem with children in desiding on what books they want to explore. Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults.     I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers. I don't beleive tax payers would appreciate that their tax money isn't going toward things that actually matter. A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down.     I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age.     Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes. Some of those ideas can educate people very well with quality knowledge or not, but are brain candy and just are fun to read.      If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book.     Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas. Some for example like 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' show what life was like in that time. And even if the book has offensive language for @PERSON1 children means that it should be correctly cattegorized"	6588	6589
4784	2	"A huge issue came to my attention today as I went to the library. I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people.     Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much.     Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record.     These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves.     Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty. What would be left to check out?"	6590	6591
4785	2	"Have you ever went to the library and picked up a book that you thought was good?     Well some people pick books by the way the cover looks,some pick it by what it says on the back,But some people pick it by what kind of book it is.If every librarian took the books off the shelf that were offensive, there would be barely any left.Just because the book is offensive doesn't mean that it's a bad book,and that doesn't mean that your not goin to learn something out of it because it's offensive.     I do not believe that certain books should be taken off the shelf just for the kind of material that it is.If other people don't like the material in the book then they don't have to read it.Some people learn things from lessons that are learned the hard way.So maybe if they didn't like the book because of the way it was written,they should read it anyways.Offensive books can teach people lessons about how other things in the world are.     Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left.     So i don't agree with taking every book off the shelf that's offensive.There is always going to be something offensive out there in the world,and we can't just get rid of everything that we think needs to go because it's offensive.That would make no sense.Not every thing's nice and sugarcoated,you have to see other parts of the world too,and i think that taking offensive books off the shelf is not the right way to go."	6592	6593
4786	2	"I believe by my beliefs alone, that nothing should be removed from the library just because someone finds the material offensive in anyway possible. So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are. People need to understand though, it was written by someone else.You @MONTH1 judge, but out of your own respect, should not report to remove of something for their ideas."	6594	6595
4787	2	"Here is what I think about materials being removed from the shelves if they are offensive. I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation?     Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf.     What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids.      When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids?      There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people.     Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials? Just remember to think about what you put on the shelves at your public library"	6596	6597
4788	2	"I think books, movies or magazines should be aloud in libraries. Some people @MONTH1 not beleive in this, maybe there is a solation to help this problem. And this way is to keep all these in the library.      Some people @MONTH1 need to learn these (offensive) books or moives, so how else are they going to be able to research them? The people that are affended by these need to try and avoid them as much as possible. There are other ways to avoid things you don't want to see or read.     A way to resolve this problem is that there should be a adult section. This way people @MONTH1 be expecting offensive thing's a little more. And people can be more meture about it and if they see something they don't like to just set it back down.     How well we know what is offensive and what is'nt? Well every person is differnt to the next person. This is way I think books should be left where they are. If everyone picks a book we think is offensive I believe there well not be many books left to read.      People have rights, and by that you can read watch whatever you want. And if you don't like it don't watch or read it. Maybe the next that comes along will enjoy it."	6598	6599
4789	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books,music,movies,magazines,etc.,should be removed from the shelvesif they are found offensive?      No, I think that it should not be removed because other people will like to learn about the things that the shelves would be offering to the public.if the people don't like what they see it should be a certain area that warn people that they might get offended so enter at your own risk.     Secondly, people should know what they are walking into in a library because they have signs that let you know what topic is what and where they are located,so if people walk into a section knowing they might get offended it would be there own fault and nobody else's.     Last but not least. If someone gets hurt it will most likely be about religion and that is basically a sign within its own name saying someone might get hurt so do not be so quick to jump into the topic or section you are going to look at.     In conclusion I think that materials such as books,music,movies,magazines,etc should not be removed."	6600	6601
4790	2	"I will persuade you to agree with me on why somethings need to be sensored at the library.  And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library.  I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library.      There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes.  What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering.  The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather.  The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them.  Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer.  There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult.  And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened.  Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war.  And what they to go through during their imprisonment.  These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern.     There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see.  Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored.  First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity.  These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies.  So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching.  There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories.  Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book.  I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored.  This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything.  about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in.  music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be.       But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.  And on the other hand there are alot of good things that do not need to be sensored like music and book and even certain magazines."	6602	6603
4791	2	"Dear Newspaper, I believe that everyone in our town should have the same right to check out books, music, movies ect. I also believe that libraries should put the ratings on the side of every book, music, movies etc, so that parents and care takers can see what type of books and music their child is checking out from our local library.               You have to remeber our local library has a very braud selection to choose from and there are some books and music in our library that I dont think are very sutible for our younger children.          Then again I think the children should be reading on there own level, but for that to happen we would have to trust our children to know what kind of material they should be looking at and what they shouldnt be looking at. Alot of younger kids come into the library not even knowing how to read and go right to the advanced section just to be cool, the library is not a place to come to act cool. Its for learning new things and advancing your reading level. If things keep going the way they are all of our books will be gone except for all the little kid books becuase those are the only things that dosnt get checked out. so please local library  would you please think about puting rating labels on the cover of everything in the library so we can put some order into this place. Sincerely, @ORGANIZATION1"	6604	6605
4792	2	"Dear newspaper, we all know that everyone will that persons will find something that is offensive to them. No matter who that person is we all have something that is offensive to us and thats that. This does not mean we need to take books off the shelves of libraries that some author spent his time an money on.     Books in libraries are either in there for informational use or just to hear a good story. No author is going to try an offend any one in anything thier writting. Why would they do that if they want their book to be well liked and bought? Truth is no one wants to be offended or talked about in a hastily way.     There is no need for censorship  in libraries. Libraries were made for educational information, history, and non-fiction tales to please our minds. If we censored all of this how would we learn what's good, what's bad, and what's acceptable in life. If a book, movie, magazine, or music is to graphic or not apropriate for that person then they should just not look at it or view it.     It's clear that every human being is different and special in their own way. We all have our own idea on what we think is right, wrong, and just plain offensive. No human on this earth is perfect, we can't decide or know what will be offensive to another. And if something is offensive, you just have to be the bigger person and go on with life"	6606	6607
4793	2	"For many years, libraries have been allowed to put certain books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves that could be considered offensive.  I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent.  Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership.       Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories.  The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,'  do not belong on the library shelves at all.  However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed.  If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership.  In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library.       Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library.  Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library.  Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store.  However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library.  Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography.       Much of the popular music today is considered offensive.  The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them.  I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances.  I do not believe that explicit music is okay.  People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it.  People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all.       Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1.  We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.  Libraries are some peoples resort to peacefulness, so lets keep it that way, and respect the feelings of others"	6608	6609
4794	2	"Absolutly not this is a free country. It is basically the same thing as freedom of speech. If someone finds the material offensive then they shouldnt read it! Sure im sure libraries in communist countries take books off the shelves, but that's because theyre communist! If you take away freedoms of people then eventually our counrty will become one of those communist countries nobody wants.     Why would anyone not be able to read a good book its a story. Music is music no matter what they say in the lyrics, and movies if you get rid of movies well then whats the @LOCATION1 coming to certainly not a free country. I enjoy all kinds of different movies. Lets see I like dramas, comedys, horror, and action movies they're all great! So what if its a little rasict or sextist all its doing is telling a story. Same with music I love songs my favorite genres are hip hop, classic, and country. Books I do not like very much but some people do so you have to keep them.     So if you ask me people that want to take books, movies, and music out of libraries to protect people then that means your just trying to protect yourself. Maybe a section in the library should be made saying these books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. I do agree with that because some people really dont know what theyre about to read, listen to, or watch. So that is my conclution on this topic."	6610	6611
4795	2	"@CAPS4 I do agree on removing offensive or negative books from the shelf. Music, books, magazines, or even movies should be atleast vision proof, in other words fix everything so kids can watch or read to.          Music, is a very popular trend on the world now. Everybody listens and feed into it, but some music and also lead to problems. You know how most songs can be played and have alof of 'negative' lyrics? Well I believe that can be fix, because not everything you say do not have to be with a vulgar word or end with one. Music is not about '@CAPS1, @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3', music suppose to make you feel good inside or maybe even down in some people cases, but music is a positive fact and people do not suppose to turn something positive into negative.          Books are influencional on me because I like to read, I enjoying reading books that I can relate to and understand cause most people can read something and not understand a thing. As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills. Even if you read a magazine, anything would help as long as your reading something. Magazines are basically about the world, celebritys and how the media react, but like a book a magazine do not stick with one topic.     Movies especially movies are a big deal in the world. If you havent notice what ever kids/teenagers/ and maybe even adults see in movie they eventually going to do it. All movies should be @NUM1 which mean, everybody could see. People fail to realize movies are not reality, what you see in movies you can not do in reality, it might be base on real stuff but its not. I love movies and im sure everybody else do to but they should really vision proof it.          In conclusion, @CAPS4 we should take the offensive stuff form the shelf just for the childeren stake."	6612	6613
4796	2	"If anything the libraries should never take book from the shelf because someone does not like it. That would make someone who really like the book that they took alway upset. Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why.     First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read.     Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it.     Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there.     In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do. No matter what people think about the books the person who made it made it for a reason thats why he/she is a writer."	6614	6615
4797	2	"I believe that certain books and other things should be removed from the shelves because, those offensive things are getting to the little kids heads. Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much.        It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books.         Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life. For all minors do not read nothing about drugs, sex, or anything that does not have to do about education or life."	6616	6617
4798	2	"While reading a book do you ever think that kids shouldnt be allowed access to reading this, especially not for a public library? If they think that book is too offensive should they be allowed to take it off the shelf? Should they just complain to the librarian? Some people will have very different opinions when answering these questions. What's the right answer though?     The way I see it, they should not be allowed to take it off of the shelf. Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section.      Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for.     Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves. It would be very disrespectful to destroy an authors hard work. People have a choice in what they read and we should not take that away"	6618	6619
4799	2	"How do yu feel about book, music and magazines in the libraries. some @MONTH1 like them other msy not. but there is always one person out there who kies them both.     Well me i could careless for them. im not even much of a read. i mean, well i do read sometimes but i really dnt like to read. because when i do read i alwas get sleepy and end up fallin asleep, and illl end up goin to sleep.

4800	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive?     Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?'     The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect.      In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes.     In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states,      '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy."	6622	6623
4801	2	"We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right? You just want to throw the book away or call the artist of the song and ask them what they was thinking! Then we have the books that we just absolutely love and want to keep rereading them all the time and the songs that we listen to everyday. The way you like something is all based on opinions and how you think.     Everyone is different. Even if its by skin color, religon, age, where you live. We are all different. Someone could like a book, magazine, or song that everyone else absoultely hates. Everybody could love a book, magazine, or song that one person absolutely hates. In the end everything is both hated and loved by someone.           Therefore if you could just remove something off the shelf or censor it so somebody is prohibited to explore it, it wouldn't be fair because there is somebody in this world that adores or would adore that. Your taking away privelages of everyone else, keeping them from wonderful stories and lyrics. Would you want someone to take away your favorite book or song? No, and neither would anyone else in this world.     I agree with Katherine Paterson, everthing would be gone in the end if we had the power to take something away that we didn't like. Nobody would have anything to read, listen to, or watch because we all can't agree on anything in this world."	6624	6625

Becuse i like books that has love, reacing, figthing and so on but not ever budy is going to like that stuff. Yes poeple like reading books that are funny, sad, or just a love books. Now moveis, muics, and maguzins are diffint then books. Becuse you got rap which i think is stupped. theres rock and roll, cuntery, pop, hard rock, jazz, and others.Movies are diffent to cuz you got movies that kids dont need to see. Good movies for kids is like @CAPS1, hopp, and so on. Maguzins are about like movies there are things in maguzins that are just as bad in muics, movies, and books. So i think there sound be a person to take the stuff off the shelves becuse who would wont there son coming home saying he lerned a new werd today and the werd he said makes your jol derop. At first he's going to lagh at you and say the werd agin. So i say yes to some budy taking that stuff off the shelves. I say alot of poeple would wont there son reading a good book depending on his age. As they grow up they would be able to read skary books or love storys what ever they wont to read. @MONTH1 be he would wont to read about reacing, fire fighters, police, mitstorys about missing poeple.Jazz and other muics needs to be sinered. becuse they say suff that little kids soud not hair at ine time of there little lifes. Poeple dont under stand that little kids are going to acked like us. And that muics teches them diserspect for are elders. Lets say you to the stor with your little boy and there is old man behid you and he said hi to you your little boy will perbole say some like shut up old man.

I think that the music is got to be for all kinds of people like old and young like for every body.     I think that the movies with the bad parts isnt aloud to even be out on the self. The people sould know better. The kids would get the movies and watch them.      I think the magazines are all right because the people can see what is going on. That how the thing that happen get around it is like a news paper.     I think that we should take off things that are offensive to people. The people fills like they are being made fun of	6628	6629
4804	2	"I'm writing about my views on censorship in libraries. I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book.     To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship?     Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds.     Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means.     A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually.     Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned.     Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong.     To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child."	6630	6631
4805	2	"Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not.     Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games.      Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored.      If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will.     Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts.     The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard."	6632	6633
4806	2	"I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been. People have the right to read or watch what they want to. I thought thats why we are @CAPS1. Our public libraries have always been safe and clean enviornments and if its not broke dont fix it.      I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it.      People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not.      Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit.      My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy. If its not broke then dont fix it"	6634	6635

It all will teach you somthing.Everyone is different. They all have there own opinion. Ithink that everything that makes it to the shelves should be able to be looked at by anyone.There might be some bad words or some bad bad things in books but it teachs them how to treat people, how to talk to people, and how to show respect to others. I don't think they should be removed from anything. If it makes it up there then that means someone wants to read it.I have gotten into a argument with my friend before over a type of movie that is able for kids to see in the library. He said it was to much for them. If its up there then everyone is able to see it. It teaches everyone something if its bad or good. Now if there is bad language in a book, yea it should marked out. Now in high school I think its ok to have those bad words in the book, movie, music, etc. If they choose to read it, or listen to it, or watch it then I think its fine. Everyone has there own opinion on things. Some people think its right and some think its wrong. It is up to the person who wants to read it, watch it, and listen to it.

4808	2	"Imagine. Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life.     My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or  in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences.     My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about.        You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something.     Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life. Life's to short. Might as well enjoy it"	6638	6639
4809	2	"Dear @CAPS1,          I am writing you @DATE1 because I think all media such as books, music, movies and magazines that are offensive should be removed from shelves from libraries because they do not set a role for people. The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem.     If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right.    We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all.      Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems.     I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place. Kid's and adult's love going to the library and their for we need to keep everything clean.                                        Thank you,                                        @CAPS3"	6640	6641
4810	2	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     @CAPS1 of us would agree with Katherine Paterson when she said that there are books we hope our future generations do not chance across. @CAPS1 of us would also agree that she made a very good point when she said that if any of us present-generation people were granted the ability to take the said books from the shelves, there would no longer be any reading material for anyone to read. Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities?     I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence,  and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail.  Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands.     There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age.     Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need.  Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their  discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material.     In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset"	6642	6643
4811	2	"For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation.      In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out.      So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased  unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping.     In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials."	6644	6645
4812	2	"There are many books in the libraries. Some people take them offensively. Materials such as books, moveis, and magazines should be removed it they are offending people.     Books that are offending someone should be removed. One reason is that they relate to people lifestyles.Some books relate to family issues and have negativity about them. Others relare to home issuse where they involve abuse. There are also book that are on bullying. These should be removed because children can read them and start bullying other children. Also they can b threatening to children that are being bullyed.     Also, movies can be offending. Movies that are based on bad action should be removed. Most of these movies consider harsh words. Children that like action movies should not be listening to anything like that. Action movies have a lot of abuse in them. Young children can act these movies out and hurt other children. Some movies also have violence in them. If children see people using violence in the movies they would want to do it to because they think its cool. Also people in these kind of movies use bad treatment toward people. This can effect people lives.     Also, magazines that are offending people should also be removed. Magazines show and tell things that celebrities are doing. Not only will young children do these things but young adults. Magazines also show people criticizing politics. Some @MONTH1 include talking bad about the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS1. Young adults @MONTH1 take this the wrong way and start doing the same thing. This @MONTH1 also make it seem like they are bad people. Also, they use verbal abuse and use bad lauguages.     Some books, movies, and magazines should be removed if  they are offensive to people. Young children and young adults are the most effected by this. They are effected because they see what adults are doing and want to do the same thing. Especially people that they think are role models. All books that are offensive should be removed."	6646	6647
4813	2	"Reflecting newspaper views on censorship in libraries. I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens.     Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries.     Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places.     Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it.     I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library."	6648	6649
4814	2	"I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.  Materials should not be offensive in any way to chilren, or any human being.  Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories.  When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story.  A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons.  I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch.       Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive.  Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something.  If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash.  The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble.      Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive.  Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something.  Children can learn so much from books, music, movies, magazines, etc., so why make them say offensive or disrespectful things?"	6650	6651
4815	2	"Censorship In Libraries     Do you believe that certain marerials such as books, music movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if found offensive? I think people learn a lot from going to the libraries. I also think they learn from reading historical text, and getting outher peoples opinions on things. I mean why take out all the information if you can learn from it.     I do think the books, movies, magazines, and music should be age appropiate. I think this because little kids should not be reading high school text. They would not understand it and not learn anything from it. If it is age appropiate I think it would be very helpful. I also think everyone should be able to go to the library to have some quiet time.     Magazines to me are very helpful. They are very helpful because you can read a small paragraph, and learn a lot. Me myself I love to read magazines they are very informational. They also have great pictures in them unlike books. If you take these out of libraries they would be no help.     I love going to the library to have some quiet time. I think that if you take out books, and magazines there would be no point in going. I also think people would not be as smart if they did not go to go to the library. Libraries are great places to go so why take out all of the information in them"	6652	6653
4816	2	"In libraries today there is a big controversy going on about wether certain books, music and magazines should be taken out due to explicit material. There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries.     The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area.     @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3.     @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries.     The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries."	6654	6655
4817	2	"Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed     I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.  I  am going to tell you why I think they should be taken off of the sheleves. I am also going to tell about one of my personal experiences with something like this.     The reason I think @CAPS1 like this should be taken off of the shelves, is because of little kids coming in and taking them off of the shelves and looking at @CAPS1, that aren't apporate for little childern to see. And older kids looking at them and getting some ideas from them and going home and doing them. Which could cause harm of even death.     A personal experience with something like this when I was in fourth grade. Is I went to my teachers bookshelf and picked out a book to take home. That night when I got home I asked my mom if she colud read it to me before I went to bed. So she did and when she opened the book it had alot of bad words in it. That are bad for little childeren to hear. So she to it to the principal the next day and showed it to him and he fired the teacher for having the book on the shelves.     Those are both good reasons why @CAPS1 like that schould be on book shelves. They can teach alot of bad @CAPS1 and get people in alot of trouble."	6656	6657
4818	2	"Should certain things in life be censored? Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read.     I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out.     Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense  if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods.     Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching.     It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out"	6658	6659
4819	2	"During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing.     When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it.      Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left?     Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people."	6660	6661
4820	2	"I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold. Movies thats what ratings are for. Magazines depends on the topics but theirs many points of view of this topic. Books, no cause you get so much information out of books its amazing you feel like your really their.            I believe that the parents are responable for what their children buy. Cause if you don't want your child to listen,read,watch. Then take a big boy/girl pill and take charge. You can whin and pull a fit all you want. But, really what good is it going to do. To me it looks like your nothing but brats.          A parents job isn't to be your childs best friend or anything. Its to be a parent. As a parent you have to make choices that teens @MONTH1 hate you for. But in the long run they will realize you made those choices for them is cause you cared. So personally I really don't think its the music's fault or movies,magazines,etc. I think its the way those kids are rised in their household, that impacts the choices they make.           Heres an example, I saw this really awesome video game that I wanted once. But my dad said no. Cause its language and themes were bad. At first I thought I hated my dad. But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run.          I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you. But always think of the possible influence you could have on someone but not intented for it to happen."	6662	6663
4821	2	"No, I think that if you take books, music and, magazines that  are offensive away then you are taking the differents between everyone away. If there are know problems then what is there to talk about. People need problems to get smarter about thing and to not do the things to are bad. Plus there will always be one person that trys to change thing or go ageines it. That is how people around the world are. We fight for what we think are wight.      I don't thing in anyones life time that someone has not when ageinst anything that anyone has said. The thing is that some people are more open about sharing what they say. But there are the other people who they down and don't fight about the little things.          If you take things away then were are we going to get hour information. The news some times have offensive suff on it. Offensive things are what some people live on if there is nothing bad going on then they could go cravy. Then what would what happen. Would the government try to keep it away from us or would we know about it.      Personly I think it would be a bad idea to take offensive things away. Music is a big thing around the would. I just don't know how you could keep that away from anyone. Movies are anther one of thoese things that the people who wight them are very out going people and would do anything to get there words out to make moeny. So in closeing I think that we sould not take offensive things away."	6664	6665
4822	2	"I believe you should leave all books on a library shelf. They are there for a reason, granted a lot @MONTH1 not be appropriate for some age groups but they do not have to pick up those books and read them. Anyone that picks up a book does it for a certain reason, they could be interested in it or they @MONTH1 just want too @CAPS1 at it and think why would anyone want to read something like @CAPS3. It all just depends on what the people in the library like.     Taking a library book off of the shelf might be inappropriate for younger kids can kind of be wrong. Just for the simple fact that it @MONTH1 not be inappropriate for adults and it could be something that they would like to read. Also almost every library has a childrens section for a certain age group and under to pick out a book for themselves to read. If they go to the adult section and get a book it is their parent or guardians responsibility to make sure they @CAPS1 at the books the child has picked out. They can choose to do that or let the child get the book.     I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem.     I was in the library not long ago and I found a book that I wanted to read, but my mother seen the cover and the section it was in and she told me to take it back. Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age. So I listened to her and I understand why but do not take it off the shelf, no reason to.     There are ways to make sure inappropriate books do not get into childrens hands. If we were to take any book off of the shelf that we did not approve of there would not be any books left, there is always going to be something wrong with every book. Someone always finds something inappropriate. Juat make sure to watch out for those books and nothing will be inappropriate for any age"	6666	6667
4823	2	"Should books, movies, music, ect. be rwmoved form the shelfs if the offend people? I dont think they should remove anything. Its not fair to the people that like certin things that other folks dont.Not many people have money to buy good books and movies they like, so taking them away would probably hurt them finantialy. Plus @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices to pick from in the library,     I think its not fair for the other people because not everybody thinks the same. The people that do like the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that.     Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up.     Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more.     So takeing away all the offensive things will jus mess @CAPS3 up for everybody. Not everyone gets offended about small things. If they were to take they were to take them away, @CAPS3 wouldnt be fair, people would lose money they dont have, and @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices. So please dont take anything good out of the library."	6668	6669
4824	2	"Yes, I totally believe that material such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. Why would you keep offensive material in the libraries anyway? If it was you in our shoes and you found a book offensive, wouldn't you want that book remove? Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong.     The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you  walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book.      All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?' So yes I believe that those things should be remove from the shelves."	6670	6671
4825	2	"Should we be censoring what people read in libraries? Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry.      Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately!     I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are.     My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance.     Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers"	6672	6673
4826	2	"Libraries          @CAPS1 we would do without books? We wouldn't have libraries, right? And @CAPS1 if someone decided to remove certain books? Libraries are very helpful to us. They are our number one resource material. Libraries could teach us many things. We could learn many topics; history, biographies about important people from the past and our present, fiction and nonfiction stories and many more. Libraries are for all ages, from youngest to oldest.     Libraries have many books, movies, magazines, sometimes even music and ect. Their is always something to learn in a library. I belive many topics are unappropriate to certain people of different ages. Yes, they are maybe to young to learn these topics, but @CAPS1 about when they get older and want to learn? We need libraries. We need books. Kids, teenagers and ect. will enentually learn the topic, either in the libraty or at home, even at school with friends; so why take our books away?      I also belive that even though I don't like certain topics, they should not be removed from the libraries. I peronally agree with the author Katherine Paterson, she thought many books were offensive to the audiance, but if someone had the power to remove a book from the shelfs, that made everyone to have this power, and @CAPS1 would we have left? We would loose very important information of our lifes and our ancestors.      People have different taste, fellings, thoughts. If we listen to every person's dislikes over our books in the libraries, our shelfs would be empty and eventually we wouldn't have libraries. I'm please asking you, don't remove our books of the shelfs. Don't take our past and our future. We are who we are because of the information books have thought us during the years. Books, magazines, movies and music are part of our lifes, taking them away, you are taking our lifes aswell"	6674	6675
4827	2	"Its an @CAPS1     Have you ever been in a library and you are looking for a certin book, but just cannot seen to find it because everything is out of order? Many libraries have trouble organizing their material, in ways that will help people find what their looking for easier. I believe that books movies, magazines and music should all be separated. I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people.     Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level.      Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it.     Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out.     This is my view on how libraries should be set up. I think by doing this it would keeps the younger children away from books that might be offensive to them. I do not think that books that some people find offensive should be taken off the shelfs, because they might not be offensive to other people"	6676	6677
4828	2	"Should certain books be removed from a library just becouse they ae found offensive? Types of movies magazines and music should all those be removed becouse some people come to find it offensive. No,Everyone has a different oppionion so in the end everything is offensive one way or another to people  thier would be no books left on the shelf.     First, of all I believe that books,movies,mucic, and magazins ets... should not be removed from the shelves becouse everyone has thier right to thier own oppinion. The author of those things had the right to publish thier work its thier oppionion lots of people @MONTH1 agree with what that piece of work as well as many people @MONTH1 not agree at all and come to find it offensive. Its your choice to listen or read certain topics,everything has a title or a gender so you should know wether that piece of work is for you or not. If you know you are going to come to a decagrenment then the easy choice is simple just to not read it or listen to it.It is a very easy choice to make, therefore not causing any type of problem.     Second, of all is thier needs to be all types of variety in library's therefore bieng books,movies,magazines music ect...for everyone to enjoy or anything you'd like. I mean thats what libraries are sapposed to be like. I like how I can go to the school library of the local town library and be able to find right about anytype of topic from it being on animals to information about drug abusers.     Last, but not least comes in the parential control. Yes, thier @MONTH1 be many parents out thier of not mostley all of parents @MONTH1 find many things in a library that they would not like thier child to see or hear. But thats just life. Parents should know what thier kids are up to so its up to them to them to teach thier child ffrom right from wrong.     In conclusion libraries should not exclude any type of music,magazine,or any type of book just becouse someone @MONTH1 come to find it offensive everyone has the right to thier own oppionion and just becouse you come to find it offensive does not mean eryone else does as well people work should be shown to the world and if you choose not to take it in then dont"	6678	6679

So if you take some books away that people like than they will not read books at all.     Let me tell you a story. I was in fith grade and I had a relly good book it was called @CAPS1 was @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and it was a relly good book. @CAPS1 about this guy how invants and mushein that makes food fall out of the sky. It was a good book but some of the kides in class made fun of the name @CAPS3 and ower fith grade techer took the book away.     In my ninth grade yare there was a book called @CAPS4 of  the @CAPS5. In this book there are this group of people called the old dogs. They are this group that are in russa and this is the time dering the cold war. There commaders name is tony he and the others go to russa to find one of the amrcions the the russa the was catsherd. So my techer read my book and took in away becuse if the langige in there book.

I toud her that the people in the move are not dead but she still would of not of let him see it. And i bought him a music @CAPS11 and she would of not let him lisint to it.          I saved up and had @MONEY1 for my bother. It was his berthday and he whated a @CAPS12 @NUM2. I had one and he whated his own.

It is a teen game, my bother is ten years old he is not old anfe yet but i let him play it. So win my dad got home he toold him to git off!

4830	2	"Over the years many materials such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., have been removed from the shelves of libraries all over the world. Well I find this to be sad and dishonorable to many people.     In the past children were able to remove book, etc., from the shelves without being questioned by anyone. Isn't @CAPS3 the job of the libraries to supply book and more to children for learning purposes weather they are in or out of school, children have the right to learn the same as everyone else in which Katherine explained, 'If you take books of the shelves then we will have no books left on the shelves for any of us.'     I have seen what this does to people, they sit around all day doing nothing just thinking about the happiness that these things brought to them and trust me @CAPS3's not a pretty sight. Just because something looks bad or inapropriate doesn't mean you can just take @CAPS3 off the shelf, due to the fact that there are others who would want to read, watch or listen to that sort of thing. I have also experienced this when I wanted to check out a @CAPS1 that was produced by a raper, I went to the check-out desk showed them the @CAPS1 and then they said, 'I'm sorry, that souldn't be on the shelf anymore.' @CAPS3 was outragious just because of @CAPS3 being produced by a raper. Now I ask you this, 'Think about @CAPS3 if you were in our shoes.'So in conclusion, the fact that the things you want to check out are being taken out dosen't feel right not to us, not to the children, and of course not to the future generation to come. We won't stand by while this happens, @CAPS3's time for them to make a choice between the right or the wrong."	6682	6683
4831	2	"Offensive reading, music, and movies are popular with parents who are trying to sheild their young children.  Not all people find this type of reading, lyrics, and appearences on @CAPS1.V. offensive, however. To some people, offensive has different meanings, and the object wouldn'@CAPS1 be out for sale if it wasn'@CAPS1 popular in some way. I don'@CAPS1 disagree with the use of offensiveness, but that is just my opinion and I have reasons to back it up.    Parents in our generation listen to the music that kids and teenagers listen to now. Some find them disgusting and vulgar, while others are singing along with the tunes on the radio and with their children. Now a days, the artists' music appeals greatly to the younger children because of the upbeat background music and not all because of the lyrics. My mother has told me time and time again about how she hates some of the artists I listen to such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of the vulgarity in their lyrics. My response is, '@CAPS4, it's all life experiences, and that's what attracts us kids to their music and they know it. Plus, sometimes I just like to listen to the songs because of the music, not just the lyrics.    Children can back up their beliefs on the music, but somehow the parents always 'know what's best.' So, they try to take away the music that the kids have come to know and love. Sorry parents, that won'@CAPS1 work. All over the popular radio stations, the hosts are playing these songs trying to get more loyal listeners, and they are succeeding. Parents can'@CAPS1 stop their children from being exposed to what they think is offensive music; sadly, it's all around them, from billboards and posters sold at malls to the so called popular music and movies of today's generation.    The famous artists wouldn'@CAPS1 be making the vulgar and offensive music if they thought no one would buy their albums. In this generation, sex, drugs, and alcohol sell, so the rap artists and the popular choice in music put those factors into their songs. Teenagers will buy their cd's and the artists will keep making music to please their buyers.    Not all music out there now is offensive though. There is country music, blues, oldies, and I'm sure more that don'@CAPS1 put vulgarity into their songs. But, if you listen carefully, more songs are starting to add curse words and talking about drinking, because they know what the people want to hear. If the parents don'@CAPS1 agree with the choice in music, they can change their presettings in their cars to more resonable music that they approve of. Eventually, I believe that vulgarity will increase and it will be all around us, not only in music, but everywhere we look.    Also, in movies, directors and producers know that the viewers want to see action. Sex and drugs sell big time in the movie area because it gives the viewers something exciting to see and to tell their friends about. People now a days don'@CAPS1 want to spend the seven or @MONEY1 to see a movie that is about praries and horses, the majority want to see something with more hype and excitement.    Most movies have been upgraded to the @CAPS5 rating instead of the @NUM1 or just @CAPS6 movies because of the reasons of offensive language and actions. To attend these movies, we all know you have to be of the age of eighteen, but what about for the teenagers that don'@CAPS1 want to sit around and watch animated movies full of made up characters? I understand that the producers and directors are shielding our eyes from the obscenity, but it just makes the movie that much more appealing to the younger children's eyes.    I believe, that as we get older, the offensive language and actions, the vulgarity in music, movies, and books, and the rude and crude message that has been displayed in front of us, will increase greatly. I'm not saying that it's okay for offensive language and actions to be in movies, books, music, etc., I'm saying it's what sells and if people like to listen to it, no one can stop them."	6684	6685

4833	2	"Censorship or No Censorship    You walk through huge metal and glass doors. As you do so your eyes fall upon huge shelves full of books, magazines, movies, music and everything else that you could imagine. Then you  proceed to walk in and out through the various forms of liturature gently touching the spines of each book, magazine, movie case, music case. But suddenly something unusal catches your eye, the sight stuns you at first. What sight would be so stunning that it would make you stop in your tracks immediatly? The answer is, the sight of your favorite section being censored. Just imagine; all of the books being taken away, all of the music being thrown out, magazines being thrown into dumpsters and so on with all of the other forms of writting, speeches, songs, and acting. That @MONTH1 be okay with others, but it's not okay with me.     How many books have you read? How many of those books did you like? How many of those books, that you liked, could be offensive to someone other than you? the chances are that everyone has probably read at least two books that could be offensive to someone else. But the chances are much greater that someone could read that book and possibly have a good reaction and maybe even be changed for the better. Take @PERSON1's book of theories of evolution as example. The book could being offensive to someone who believes in a higher power and they might think that their religion's bible is the one and only story. But to a medical, science or even history student the book could help them understand their field of study and research better. Therefore, making one side strongly against the book, but one side strongly in favor of the book. No matter which side you're on, one will almost always lose to censorship.     During the time of presidents such as @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1 and various other there has always been a war under the surface and it's name was censorship. It went further than most would think. It went to files, books, music, and eventually movies and magazines. When @CAPS1 was president there was censorship with books and newspapers galor. The books would be censored when something was considered racist, un-american or even political. The newspapers would be censored when an article was considered political, racist, un-american, rude, kind and an other reason you could possibly think of. Another case of censorship was when a famous singer was not allowed to sing for the president and first lady because of her ethnic background. Finally the first lady's persuasion was enough to get her favorite singer to sing for her with one complication, the singer had to sing outside on the front steps instead of inside like past performers had.     The new victims that are falling to censorship is music, movies and magazines. Where the main reason why the past forms of liturature were to be censored was on ethnic backgrounds and racism; it has no been shifted to gay, straight, bi, lesbian and other sexualities. This @MONTH1 not effect some people, but it could change someone's life by helping then realize who they are. A sad part is that this could also go in reverse it could open an oppurtunity for bullying. Again no matter which side someone is on, somebody will lose.     To be completely honest I think that cecnsorship is completely and absolutely wrong, especially in libraries. When someone is in their childhood all of the way into their adulthood, they go to the library if they want to find a book, magazine, movie, song or even sometimes a newspaper. Should their eyes be shielded from what others think are wrong, offensive, stupid or unethical? I think not, I think that the information is put out there for a reason and should have it's own voice."	6688	6689

One time i was watching this movie and this boy made a fire in the school and i thought it was cool because he did it and he didnt get caught., So i goes to school with a friend @NUM1 i watched the movie and told lets make a fire in the boys bathroom so i had some machess and he had a lighter. then we stared to put tissiu on fire then it had got out of control and we ran out with spoke all threw the hall way the fire went out but my friend and I had got expelled for that school year.See we thought it was cool but it wasnt.          Music sometimes gives a bad message out to kids to go sell drugs or beat somebody up even still. If you do those things you will get in some big troubel that you dont want to be in.

When you go to find the book, you realize that it is no longer there; the book was removed from the library because it was believed to offensive.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because authors have freedom of speech and press, censorship is based off opinions, and censorship affects everyone within a community.     A part of living in the @LOCATION1 is having freedoms such as the freedom of press and the freedom of speech.  Those freedoms apply to everyone.  Censoring a book is like taking away those freedoms from the author.  Their book is their voice and no ones voice should have to be silenced.  Some books that are censored are not written by @CAPS1 authors, but that does not mean that the books should be taken away.  The books still represent some person's feelings and beliefs in the world and those books might relate to someone who is living in @LOCATION1.     When books are chosen to be censored, it is because of a person's opinion and opinions vary greatly from person to person.  Some people live a very sheltered life which would result in an opinion that many books are offensive and inappropriate for students to be reading.  Other opinions can be based off of religion or politics.  If people with these opinions are allowed to remove and censor all books they found inappropriate, there would be nothing left for children to read.     Parents usually pass their opinions onto their children and this will affect what they read and watch.  While these opinions should be respected, they should not affect the books and children within the school.  If a parent tries to remove a book from a library, another parent will try to keep it in the library.  Instead of a meeting with the board and an argument that goes along with it, parents should only enforce their rules within their homes.  The parents should sit down with their children and explain their rules and expectations about what their children should and should not read.  This way the children will know their boundaries and it will not affect anyone else within the community.         Censorship affects all people everywhere: it affects authors, students, parents, etc.  When books become censored, opinions clash and arguments begin.  Censorship should not be allowed because it goes against the the rights we as @CAPS2 are given, there are too many opinions to be able to satisfy, and it affects so many people."	6692	6693
4836	2	"Censorship in libraries can be not only a benefit but a loss as well. Censoring books in a library is understandable when it comes to offense, but it is also difficult to satisfy everyone when it is based on just that. If libraries allowed any person to remove items that they find offensive, there wouldn't be much that a library would have left on the shelves. Everyone has different opinions and are offended in different ways, so censorship could benefit people, but it could also be a disadvantage for others.     As a standard citizen, I think that censorship in libraries is not a good idea. If a library censored every item that offended someone, there wouldn't be many things that they could reveal uncensored. There are things that some people @MONTH1 find inappropriate in important pieces of literature, things that are an important part of history and such. I think that if a library was to have a rule on censorship, it should be limited and made so that people will understand the guidelines. For instance, if there were some extremely vulgur context within some items, the library should have a designated section for those pieces and it should have some kind of sign or warning letting people know what they are getting themselves into. A library should also organize its' layout so that there are different sections for each level of maturity, such as adult, teen, children, or something along those guidelines. I don't think that censorship is a bad thing, but I also think that it should only be taken to a certain degree that can somewhat satisfy everyone.     All in all, library censorship depends on how the management feels the library needs to be ran. Many libraries can be ran in many different ways when it comes to censorship, but I don't feel that everytime someone takes offense to a piece of work that the library contains they should remove it from thier contents. Censorship can benefit many people if they get their way so that they feel more comfortable knowing what they are going to see when they get an item, but it can also be a loss to those that wish to explore and learn new things; a process that a library is supposed to be used for."	6694	6695
4837	2	"You Can't @CAPS1 That On @CAPS2     I don't think that certain materials should be moved from shelves because others don't like them. To speak bluntly about it I would have to @CAPS1 if you find it offensive deal with it. We still have that right as @CAPS3 citizens don't we? Once more, why should others have to miss out on something that could potentially help them in some way just because you see its vulgar?      To go into depth I would like to state that what people believe to be offensive to others was created by an immature society. It is a wonder why we don't know everyone in the world personally seeing how everyone likes to get into others business. Hypocrites are the only people who would be supportive of something such as this. If you would let me take it deeper; you can find fault in any and everything the world has to offer if you look for it. But who would be the inconsideraste narcasistic asshole to do such? I'll explain who.     You might've heard of the recent @PERSON2 incident if not I'll elaborate. @PERSON2 was going to be on the childrens show @CAPS4 @CAPS5. As a childhood fan this was a very big deal to her she explained it as being probably the best thing to happen to her. But while shooting the show @PERSON4 wore a strapless sundress and someone became 'offended.' The show was never released and her dream of being on one of her favorite childhood shows was crushed. Parents @CAPS1 she was too suductive and her clothing could be chalked up as too sexual for children. Yes, that is what I said you don't have to reread it. My argument is this; if I wanted to be ignorant and trash @CAPS2 I could very easily do it. Some examples of this are as follows. @PERSON1 is way too sexual for a cartoon movie with a @NUM1 rating. Ariel the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be changed immediatly because she only wears clam shells over her breast. Tinkerbell's attire should be changed because her dress is way too short. @PERSON3 the iconic female cartoon character looks like a prostitute.      All of the characters above are characters seen by children or are well know be children and adults. What is the difference between them and @PERSON5? Some mighjt @CAPS1 for one she's not a cartoon character but we do have a word for people who have a fetish for cartoon characters. I won't go into more detail on that but just know it makes no difference. No one would even dare to tell @CAPS8 that their characters can be seen as vulgar and not very child friendly. So neither should @PERSON2 be said to be vulgar. If you haven't already become offended and are still reading allow me to shower you with more interlectual reasons. I like to call these reasons common sense.      My first reason is the same sundress that @PERSON4 wore is being sold in children sizes. So it's ok when a child wears it, hell you could probably @CAPS1 its cute. But when a woman wears the same dress you @CAPS1 it's sexual. What kind of insolent moronic thing is that? If the dress is seen as sexually explecit when women wear it then it is no longer fit to be worn by @CAPS6 girls.     My second reason is that @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a childrens show. This means none of those children are going to pay attention to how sexy the cast is. They are going to be enjoying the humor, lights, and music. And anyone who tries to @CAPS1 otherwise is the exact definition of the word idiot. I don't remember most of the episodes of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 let alone what the characters were wearing.     And my final reason is you have to be some kind of pervert to watch a childrens show just to see how the women look. That is the prime example of having no decentcy or morals. This also tells me how hypocritical these parents are. This means they went to the show and instead of listening to the message that was being sent they had their eyes all over @PERSON4.      In conclusion I would have to @CAPS1 no one has the right to judge others by any means. Now am I saying you should be able to go to your local library and rent some pornography; not at all. But I am saying is people need to stop trying to be some uptight about simple things. Nothing in this world is done without reasoning this goes double for books, movies, magazines, and music. No one will write a book just to write it. There is always a meaning to it and for you to try and take that book off of the shelves because it offends you sickens me. Bottom line if you find it offensive deal with it within your family. Don't try to speak for everyone and don't try to censor everyone"	6696	6697
4838	2	"I don't believe that there should be the removal of offensive materials because there always is a person that is offended by everything. If there was the removal of all offensive materials, there would be no information to read, listen to, or view. If the content is offensive, then they should put an age limit on it. Just like if a movie has a lot of violence, it would be rated @CAPS1 and only people over the ages of @NUM1 would be allowed to view it. It should be used with all the media we have around us, like barriers on songs that have explicit lyrics in them or books with foul language in them.                     There should be at the very least a system to reenforce this idea. It would keep the easily offended people happy and the ones who use the media at a content level. It would just be obsured to keep the people who want to view it from watching the videos and watching the movies with dirty things in them. The inability to access such materials would cause a big uproar in the national public. It would anger the public to the point of not buying media related things.                            People would stop buying @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. Then the economy would be crappy because of the loss in the revenue of the @CAPS2's, @CAPS3's, and all of the other countless offensive materials.I believe that it would be wrong to take away the very thing that this country relies upon because then the country would be in the toilet. Then the government would have to bring it back in order to fund our country. It just seems kinda ridiculous to put a restriction on media.                                                                 Other people's freedom of speech is either being stifled or gotton rid of. It seems as if the artists and other people who say what's on their mind are being silenced when they have really good ideas to share with the world."	6698	6699
4839	2	"In my opinion I do not think that certain materials should be taken out of libraries for any reason no matter what they are. If something is really bad and people do not like it that doesn't mean we should deny the people of our society the right to learn about it. Whether the libraries mix the material in with all of the other books in the library or make a section devoted to offensive material, I still think libraries should carry any material made with information that can be used to learn.     There are probably a lot of arguments that you can use to try to say that we should not put certain things in libraries, but there are also a lot of reasons on why we should put them in libraries. I will start with saying that we live in america where we have rights that represent freedom. We have the right to learn about whatever we want no matter if it be good or bad.      Next I will talk about why books, music, etc., should not be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. If something is found offensive than that means someones opinoion has been used negatively towards something that they dont like. If we were to start taking stuff out of libraries just because we thought they were offensive, then there would be nothing left in any library because everything in there would be found offensive to at least one person. So just because someone or even more than just one person finds something offensive, it doesn't mean we shouldn't let people learn about it.     Now I will give an example on why it would be a terrible idea to take material that is offensive to some people out of libraries. In the @CAPS1.S.A we had a horrible tradegy occur on @DATE1. Terrorist came to our country with only one thing on there minds and that one thing was to destroy us. If you thought what I just wrote was something interesting and you wanted to learn about it then I would tell you to go for it. But what if all offensive material got taken out of libraries and there was no way for you to research it or find out what had happened on that day. Yes, this did offend millions of people when it happened, but we still have the right to learn about it.     So no, I do not think we should take any material out of any library no matter how offensive it @MONTH1 be. Learning is a very important thing to every living thing on this planet and to take the right to learn away from someone is just proposterous."	6700	6701
4840	2	"Some people consider that now in days theirs a lot of thing that are more offensive shown in movies and books; things that are shown in public libraries. And some of those people want to take out, all of those thing from the shelves. Why? Because they think that things like that are a good example for their childrens.     But in my personal opinion I think that no one has the right to take away from someone something they like to watch or read about. Because not all of the people think the same way. And because some people like to read or watch those type of things. I think that is very simple if you don't like a movie or a book just don't watch it or read it."	6702	6703
4841	2	"There are many books on the shelves of libraries containing information about war, violence, have sexual content and other things that you @MONTH1 not want your child to read about, but you can not make it all go away.  If one person starts taking books off of the shelves of libraries, then everyone will want to do the same.  If there is a book that someone wants to read, then they should be allowed to read it.  It is that person's choice whether to read it or not, and it is not our place to judge them.       If you are someone that does not believe in violence or war then that is your choice.  That does not give you the right to be able to take away everything that teaches people about it.  Other people are curious about war, and want to know what it is all about.  War is apart of our world's history, and if you take that off the library shelves, then it is like you are taking away a big part of history.  Taking these types of books out our libraries, will result in taking these subjects out of our schools as well.  This would really hurt the kids of learning about history in their history classes.  You can not just take that away from them, and expect them not to find out about it.  They are going to learn about it someway, and books will help them understand it so much better.  Just becuase books contain information about war, it does not mean that they do not teach us about good things as well.  Yes, they @MONTH1 go into depth about the struggles and what war is all about, but they also teach us about overcoming struggles, coming together, and teamwork.       If one person begins to take books out of the libraries then so will everyone else.  It is like a monkey see, monkey do kind of effect.  Before you know it, all books will be out of the libraries and no one will be be able to read about anything.  Doing this would greatly affect your child's learning abilities in a horrible way.  Reading is the main way that kids learn in school, and without books it is almost impossible for your child to learn at all.  This would decrease the development of your child's learning, and their skills would not be at their full potential.     If you find a book offensive, that does not mean that you can just take it away from others.   People @MONTH1 want to learn about things that you do not, and that does not give you the right to take that away from them.  Let people read about what they want, it is completely their choice and their choice only.  It is understandable that you @MONTH1 not want your child to read a selection of books in the library, but do not take that ability from someone else.  There should be no censorship in our libraries.  It is a great privilage to be able to read something you are curious about, and it would be horrible to snatch that away from others."	6704	6705
4842	2	"No I don't believe that those certain materials should be removed. Sometimes its good to have those things on the shelf because most of those things are telling whats going on around the world and what some people are interested in.     Books are something to read and learn and also to refresh your mind depending on what you are reading. I read books that interest me such as horror, action, and poems. The thing I read could be different from what others read. Thats why it should be a variety of things on shelves because its always people that have a different taste of books.     Music is somthing everybody listen to. You have those who listen to rap, hip hop, r&b, rock, and also gossip. Thats why there are different radio sations for those who have different taste of music.      Magazines are facts and someones opinion that is about someone famous or someone that have alot attention drawn to them. Its also alot of news reporters that post pictures and get some news about them.     Thats why I say no because everybody does not read, watch, or listen to the samething. That why it should be a variety of things for everyone to enjoy what interest them"	6706	6707
4843	2	"Censorship Does @ORGANIZATION1 has always been an issue in society. Dictating what media is in citizens reach would rarely result in good thing. Examples of this can be found in literature, such as @CAPS1 @NUM1 and in the real world example, the population of modern day @LOCATION1. Getting rid of all offensive material would prevent people from having a choice of what they read. It would also eliminate some of the most important pieces of literature in history from the shelves.      For many people, having a choice is very important. Gay rights and abortion political issues are perfect examples of society's need for choice. Taking away all said offensive books, movies, magazines and more would loudly take away the choice that people have to read them. If one wants to read To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3 @CAPS4, he or she should be able to have access to that information, even if others @MONTH1 find the racism themes and language in the dialogue and narration offensive.      As adults and young adults, people are responsible for themselves, and have control over their actions. If one doesnt want to read a book or magazine that contains offensive or inappropriate material, he or she should maintain this responsibility and put the book down and find something more suitable for his or her taste in the vast ocean of books in the library; that is the purpose of the library. In addition, book and movie reviews are easily accessible on the internet. A reliable resource commonsense.com. On this website, thousands of books, movies and television series are reviewed by parents and rated based on content. It is free, and almost anybody could visit this site before venturing to the library to make a selection appropriate for his or her self.     In a quote from author @PERSON1, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. @PERSON1's statement is completely true; @ORGANIZATION1 has their own opinion of what is inappropriate or offensive. By the time these people all express these feelings, so many books with so many different contents and topics will be removed from the shelf. An example of this is @CAPS5; his work will be studied and marveled by many for years to come. However, in several of his plays, sexual innuendo and gestures are used. This doesn't make him any less of a poet or writer at all. People that enjoy his work should still have access to it, despite others' opinions of it.       By censoring the media on the library's shelves, one is deprived of the choice of what he or she takes in as well as easy access to some of the most noteable pieces of literature. The option of eliminating these materials should be avoided by all to keep literature alive and easily accessable"	6708	6709
4844	2	"I think that everyone is different, everyone has thier own opinions, and everyone is interested in different things. Who is to say what is aproprite and whats not, because there are alot of people in the world, and what I said aplies to all of them. It is true there would be no books to read. It would also cause alot of fighting over the simple fact that some one had someone eleses boooks removed ect.     So no I do not agree with books being taken off shelves. What is being published in these books they are refering to cant be any nore harmfull than the nightly news or whats happening in the world. So live and let live there is no one that is forcing you to check out the books you dont prefer.     This would just be another reason for the states to fight, and bicker amungst ourselves. We as a country are free, we have the right to read what ever we want. Maybe they should be in the back or a diffreret room for storage so they wernt in plain sight."	6710	6711
4845	2	"Do you think that the library is an interesting place when you can decide if you want to read something bloody or even something perverted? Do you think the library should only hold kid books and some educational books? The library should be a place for you to adventure, believe, and create in.     The library is a place where people that write what they think is interesting in books for others to enjoy. Free publication of speech right? Well if you get rid of everything that some people think is offensive, then you might as well get rid of the whole library. No one is going to agree with everyone. I mean some educational books, like the ones about @LOCATION1, have pictures of half naked men and women that walk around with their breast showing, but that's just @LOCATION1 and they are trying to inform you about their culture.     I understand somethings, like half naked girls on the car magazines, can be tossed out. Those type of things are pointless and if some teenage boy wants one of those magazines, they can buy it at a store. You need to understand, some of the offensive stuff you read is helpful. It's no ones fault but your own if you pick up a book and start reading it and then figure out there is some offensive stuff in it. If you dnt like it don't pick it up, but don't make them take all the offensive stuff out.      Think about the old people, they still like some romance in their lives, so they like to read romantic novals. Believe me I have read some of those and they all are not so religious, but it's what the older generation likes. What about the younger, hopeless teenagers? They love to read about killers and muders. Do you think that these books are all rainbows? I don't think so, but at least the average teenager is reading.     Coming to my conclusion, I just want you to think about your favorite series or author. Are they family friendly, or do you like to be naughty at times? Remember, you wouldn't want them taking your favorite books away from you."	6712	6713

4847	2	"Yes, i do feel that certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the libraies.Some of the things in the libraries can cause children, teen, or even adults to do, learn, or hear the wrong things. I feel that book such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' are not a very good choice for reads of any age because, it entertains witch craft and things of the devil.I believe that book like that are encouraging people to want to try and experiment things some reads do read things like that for fun the take it heart and try to become the book in a way, which could lead to problems.     There are, differnet types of magazines. Some are ok and some are not. I think that out of all the things the magazines should constantly be check. There are ne w issues out atleast every week and some @MONTH1 contain certain pictures or articles that are not right for the libraries. I think that this is a verty bigissue because too many times i have went past something that I felt were offensive.       Some of the movies can be classified as inapropriate as a well. There are many diffrent movie out,but i don't think that certain ones should be allowed in the libraries. Some movies have to much sexual content as well as volgur language. Not every movie is ment to be put on library shelves. I think that what ever movies or books that people would like to read or whatch that are not appropriate should come from the libraies. Many differnt types of people with different beliefs pass through libraries. Some @MONTH1 feel the same as i do.     There should be a nice variety of music in the libraies but i think that it should be screened before put on the shelves to the public. Some songs either have too much bad laguage, downgrade women, bad laguage, sex, or talk about killing, robbing and or stealing. The full @CAPS3 should be heard by one other head librarians orr who every is over that deparment,just because one or two songs sond okay or the beging does'nt sound that bad doesn't meant that it is still appropriate for a library setting.     In conclusion, I strongly agree that some of the  books,music,magazines, and movies in libraries should be properly reviewed. If a person happenes to come past something in appropriate I think the shoul notify someone in charge of tha section so that it can be removed and replaced by something more suitable. You never know who is looking at the things that  are displayed on the libraries shelves it could be children, teen, or adult. Thats why I agree that cetain things should be removed from the libraries because some of things are offensive."	6716	6717
4848	2	"Libraries from all around the world consist of materials that are found offensive in many ways.  These books are being looked at in many views, by children, teenagers, teachers and even parents. Parents have to wonder what their child is researching at school and if things are being talked about, that should not be talked about. Censorship should be happening in certain libraries around the world but in some libraries you should take it upon yourself to stay away from those certain materials.     Children at an elementary school should be involved with 'The @ORGANIZATION1' books, or materials on animals. No child should be looking or reading materials about sex or drugs at such a young age. Censorship of those materials would be encouraged, not only by teachers but the parents of those children going home and telling mom and dad about sex. Im sure thats not the reader the author intended on reading the material but sometimes it happens and could lead them into trouble.     Teenagers on the other hand are a little more grown up. By saying 'a little more grown up' I mean, they are considered to be smart about what they do in life and the choices they make. In the library at my school you are going to find those materials that invovle sex and drugs but as a teenager myself, I know what is wrong and right and take out of it the lesson the book @MONTH1 have on me. Take drugs for a instants. If I start reading a book about a teenager who was invovled in sports but started doing drugs and lost a scholarship by doing so. I would think this book is appropiate because it shows what drugs could do to a dream you @MONTH1 have. I love playing basketball and by starting drugs, I could end my whole career in a few seconds. Teenagers around the world need to read what authors have to say about their experiences and learn from them.      Overrall, I do not believe that authors made their materials to encourage students and others to start doing things such as sex and drugs. I take it upon myself to stay away from these materials but sometimes things pop up in books and you just have to go on and not make a big deal about it. Those things are part of life and we need to handle situations even if that means not banding certain materials from libraries. It would help many concerns people have but also your taking away the opportunity of showing the teenagers and even others what the real world is like and what to be aware of.      I believe there should be a line drawn to where those materials are, considering the age of people looking at them. Also the surroundings of the location.  Like at a highschool where students are pushing to get through high school to graduate and go on to college, not to take the day to read about topics that could get them into trouble and ruin something great from happening to them. Not letting sex and drugs take their chances of going on in a sport, ruining their lives, or ruining the life of someone else. If those certain materials are left in libraries children should be kept away from them,  and teenagers need to think about what they are reading and make good decisions"	6718	6719
4849	2	"Do you find that censorship is a part of your everyday life? It is awful how many times a day someone hears or sees someone use a swear word or some type of offensive gesture. There are lots of book, music, movies, and magazines that use inappropriate language or something that might offend someone else.     I believe books should not be removed from the shelves if it has vulger words in the story. Its a part of the story and sometimes the only way to convey the message is to get someones attention by using those type of words. It is used to tell the story the way it was. It wasnt intended to make anyone feel offended. I would suggest to do away with some swear words but not all of them.     No matter what type of music you listen to it could be rap, country, hip-hop, or r&b you know that there will be censored words in the songs. I think a lot of rap and hip-hop in the modern day has changed tons. It seems like every song you listen to you can not go more than two or three words with out someone swearing. Censored music should be done away with! You do not want the youth of @LOCATION1 to learn these words at a young age. I think most parents would agree that they do not want their kids listing to this type of music.     Magazines are available almost anywhere thses days. Young children have access to them at almost all times. Those kids @MONTH1 see famous people who they @MONTH1 look up to drinking, giving people the middle finger, or smoking. Kids will see that and want to try it. Magazines should not put anything of that nature in any articles. Like i said before, you do not want the young of @LOCATION1 to learn these type of actions.     It seems like movies started it all. From shooting people to swearing, movies have everything we do not want. If someone takes a child to a movie they will be influenced by the movie and maybe do something that is not right. If movies were less graphic and cut down on the swearing it would make a difference. Movies dont have to be done away with just limit the age range to where young people can not watch graphic movies.     I think libraries are the culprit of it all. The offer everything such as: access to computers, magazines, movies, books, and even music. They don't check everything to make sure there isn't anything censored. They allow just about anyone to check out anything. If the libraries would check more often maybe we would'nt have the issue of children of offending someone or saying swear words.     No matter if your for or against censored material being removed from the shelves you should realize the facts. Children of @CAPS1 or being surrounded by these things everyday. Its almost impossible to avoid, but maybe if we did away with censored items you could see the difference with the children. The least @LOCATION1 could do is take this into account and try to remeber that censorship is all around, if everyone tried to avoid censored items there is no doubt that @LOCATION1 would be a better place"	6720	6721

We are allowed @ORGANIZATION1 of speech but not the @ORGANIZATION1 to read, or watch, or even listen to something if another @CAPS2 says that they do not like\condone it?

Some books @MONTH1 have material that seem extremely prejudice to one person and an eyeopener to another, which @MONTH1 lead to that angry person issuing out a ban on that book for use of prejudice but for those people that have not yet seen that book @MONTH1 never experience the life changing words written inside. Say the ban was issued; how many people will know what say, @CAPS6 @CAPS7's @CAPS8 was, or @CAPS9, or the @CAPS10 @CAPS11? The easiest answer to the question, little to none. Say the ban was not issued; how many people would know the history that many people endured and fought to prevent the future from becoming and try to become a new after reading said book? The easiest answer to the question, many. In the book @ORGANIZATION1, you can read about how they read about what life @PERSON3 and the other @CAPS12 had to go through, and what how their own lives, compared to hers, was similar, but the difference they saw was that @PERSON3 was a prisoner with little to no hope for @ORGANIZATION1, they on the other hand have that oppurtunity and they remembered that book and it helped most of them to continue through life remembering that their own can never be as bad as hers. now if that angry persomn that was mentioned earlier saw this, do you think they would still like to issue that ban or do you think they would want that book to be broadcasted?                                       Music     I, myself, must admit that if I could ban some music, I would, but would that be fair to others that like that music? I do not think so; for example I have a friend who loves scream-o, but he hates rap, I on the other hand hate scream-o and love rap, so would I ban scream-o if I could, no, why not, because I would not like if someone tried to ban the music I like, besides music gives people energy and makes their day better.                                       Movies     @CAPS13 are actors tyhat we all love and hate, but censorship on  movies because @PERSON1 or @PERSON2 is in it? C'mon. @CAPS5 some people view movies as prejudice or just horrible some do not. Tropic @CAPS14 for example had a black movie character who actually believed he was @CAPS15-@CAPS2 and this offened alot of people, but to some, myself is who @CAPS15-@CAPS2 it was quite the treat. Was the movie almost banned, yes, possibly, but @CAPS13 were some @CAPS15-@CAPS2 people who protested against the banning because they felt that it was fine; they did not break any boundaries in which we would feel offended but they kept it at a constant.     The moral of this story is to not judge a book by its cover (cliched I know but it works); @CAPS5 you hate hate something does not mean someone else does not so don't knock it until you try it"	6722	6723

4852	2	"Do you think that just because it would be harder to get that younger kids won't try to get it anyways? The books in the library are organized in sections adult and childrens. The younger kids should know that they shouldn't be in some sections. It's not the library's fault they look at the book their parents should tell them they can't not just the other adult in the library. Some high school students use some of that to do homework and projects.     Today more and more books, music, and magazines have inappropriate language and pictures. Parents should be aware of all of this and just because they don't like it doesn't mean somebody else don't enjoy it. The more people talk about how bad all of this stuff is in front of children is making them want to go look at it to see why and how it's so bad. Parents blame the library when their kids see these kinds of things in all these materials when it's not their fault, because when children come into the library they shouldn't have to have a babysitter. There are many different places for younger children to see these kinds of things, and just because its easier to see in certain places it's not the owner or managers fault they see it.      The library tries to seperate the books, the music, and the magazines. When the younger children see their older brothers and sisters looking, laughing, and joking about these things they want to see what it is as well. Parents don't blame their children it's easier to blame somebody they don't know. Some adults look at these thing and if they are all taken away then it's not doing anything but giving them a reason to look around for information. Eventually they will hear about it and go looking for books and whatever else they can find over what they hear. There are worse things on the internet then in books, songs, and magazines.      The internet has everything anybody can think of, and parents let their kids on the internet just as much as the let them go to the library. The internet is more descriptive and has more detail compared to any book. People all around the world put things on computers that they think most people wont see. They might do it to show friends and family that they don't see very often, because they live in a different state or whatever it is. If parents are okay with their kids to play on the internet why do they want reading materials taken away from people who can use them for school.     Parents act like just the younger kids are the only kids that look at these things, when some people use them for important matters. If these things are taken away form everybody becasue one kid does what they know they shouldn't it's not fair to the people who don't abuse their privileges. Why should people who use these things responsibly have to lose their privileges of using books and magazines if they look at them and don't destroy them and let younger kids that shouldn't see them look at them. Either way younger kids are going to see these kinds of things so why take them away from others that can use them responsibly."	6726	6727
4853	2	"In the world today not much is done to censor library items and this is wrong.  Censorship needs to happen because what if a random child picks up a book that is inappropraite for their age and they read the book, the book might give the reader the wrong idea.  In a time of increasing amounts of inapropraite behavior, censorship could be a key to stopping innapropraite behavior.       If a reader picks up a book and reads the book, the contents and text of that certian book @MONTH1 become an influence for the reader.  If a book showed how gang violence was benifical to society, the reader @MONTH1 develop an urge to join a gang, and the reader has no idea of what they are getting themselves into.  Books, movies, music, and magazines all influence the reader.  If a reader takes a magazine that is pornographic from the library, than the reader @MONTH1 begin to show an intrest in pornography, and develop an addiction to pornography.  All of these behaviors are innapropriate in today's society.  No matter what the case is a library should have censorship over its material, and take out all uncensored items that are deemed inappropriate for the reader from the libraries shelves.  Also, the libraries should be accountable for making sure the item that the reader is checking out is age appropraite.  By doing all of these things readers will be less likely to see inapropraite content and not be influenced by the wrong contents of a library item.     In the world today people are influence by friends, family, and television.  However, library materials can be just as influencial as all the other items listed above.  If libraries censor material and take out all uncensored items, bad influences among the reader are less likely to happen because the items that they checked out are censored"	6728	6729
4854	2	"Everyone has their own beliefs. A library is provided for anyone to come and check out books, magazines, etc. However, those could all contain offensive contents. Some parents wouldn't like their children to read or see certain things in those books.     I think that if a child is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to pick their own reading materials. If they're younger, they should have permission from their parents to check something out. That way, nobody is disrespected.      There should be separate sections in the library. A section for adults, one for children @NUM1+, one for children under @NUM1, and a random section for just anyone. Also, a section for magazines and one for younger kids should be made.     In my school, we can check out whatever book we want. I have read some with words/graphics that would be offensive to some readers. In my opinion, if you think the book would offend you in any way, then you shouldn't read it.      Everyone has a right to write what they want. I think it would be wrong to not sell or provide books from certain authors just because of the offensive words, etc. it contains. Libraries should be like the movie theater, in some way. They should label books as rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@NUM1, etc."	6730	6731
4855	2	"I beleive strongly in freedom of speech, and the freedom to say @CAPS2 you want when you want. Those offensive reading and veiwing materials are just another point of veiw of another soul in the world, and should'nt be taken offense to, but understood and taken with a grain of salt because, some people might feel the same way about how you feel. I think everyone has been on both sides of this predicement, i know people have said and/or things that have offended me, and i problably have offended someone as well.     Offending people with a sense of wanting to hurt them is @CAPS1, but my friends and I are all about the same when it comes to this subject, we joke around and 'cut up' alot, and sometimes people take offense to that, but we really dont mean to piss them of, we were just kidding. I am the type of person who will tease someoneand stuff, but that means i like u, so if i dont mess around with u, i problaby dont care for you to much.     I try to think that people arent really as mean as they are and that they were reallyjust kidding, but i know people are hatefull by nature. People who try to hurt other peoples self asteem are not good people and should be in more trouble than they get in for picking on people.     From @CAPS2 i have seen in school is that people, I think try to be offended by things as a reason to get into a fight or cause trouble and be the center of attention. Its sad that people resort to that but its happenig every day in my school.' @CAPS2, u called me a fag, im gonna beat ur ass,' is a term I have heard to many times to bear any longer.     In conclusion, its @CAPS1 to pick on somebody or offend them to actulaly hurt them. people should just grow up in my oppinion, and just role with the punches life deals"	6732	6733
4856	2	"Do you have a child? If so would you want them to see a bad book or a bad movie? That involves mature adult views only? Especiall, at your own @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     I do not want my children to ever be exposeed to that kind of negativity. That is for adult's only, not for your little childrin. All @CAPS1 @CAPS2's should take off the shelfs anything that they would not want their children to see.      Imagine going into a @CAPS2 and see some ten year old boy looking at a bad magazine. It would break your heart and make you think wow that kid's to young to be reading about bad stuff like that. All @CAPS2's should take that into mind not only does it make the @CAPS2 look bad it also makes our community look bad. To let little kids see bad images their not ready for.     If @CAPS1 librarys are going to promote that kind of behavior then they shold make you be eighteen. Or make you have a parents consint not just say here ya go without their parents even knowin that they got it. Every @CAPS2 should monitor what they put out on the shelves.     To sum up my collusions all @CAPS1 @CAPS2's should monitor what they view to the @CAPS1 to borrow. They need to think about if their preants seen them reading it or watching it would they get mad? They need to consider that factor when ever they are putting materials out for the @CAPS1"	6734	6735
4857	2	"Firstly, I believe that it is okay for libraries to have censorship on their shelves as long as a person is eighteen and over to check out what ever book or movie they want to check out.                          Secondly, I believe there is nothing wrong with the censor movies, books, and ect. Because some adults want to learn new things about life, and what their children are doing in the world today.                                                                                          Lastly when a personenter the adult session in the library, I believe that they should have to show a valid state @CAPS1, to prove that they are eighteen and over."	6736	6737
4858	2	"Are there book that you have read to make you feel offended? I have not read any offending books in my life but other people have. Do you think we should take books off the shelf that offend or taint people?     Some libraries have more books than others. Most of the books are read by the librarians. The librarians might think that some books do not offend them but they don't know what has gone on in other people lives. Perhaps, someone had a family member die and the book made them feel uncomfortable.     If someone is offended by the book should the library have to take it off the shelf? I don't think they should have to because that book might not offend someone else so they could enjoy the book better.     I truely don't think it would be fair to some people who enjoy reading books. For the simple reason that it is going to offend many people whether they like it or not. When you take a book off the shelf because it offended someone you will not be able to augment anotherone on the shelf because it will offend another person.     If I ever read a book and it offended me I would go to the library and check out another book. I just say there is no need to blow it out of proportion. It is only a book and it shouldn't offend someone that bad.     That is why I think you should not take books off the shelf if they offend someone. It will not offend everyone who reads it. So next time this happens to one of you just return the book and get one that will fit with what you read and that will not offend you."	6738	6739
4859	2	"Acoording to the quote by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 has, or should have the right to remove a book or magazine or etc. off a shelf if @CAPS1 finds it offensive. There are bad books out there, and we could or our childern could be reading these books too. But do I think we should just be able to reccomend the removal of these books or to remove them ourselves off shelves? No i don't, I think that everyone has the freedom to do as they please, within the law of course. So if a kid, or an adult sees a book that might look offensive to the naked eye they should not pick it up and look at it. And if they do then they cant complain or ask to have these books removed off shelves. Kids know between right and wrong and so do adults, so they know what kind of books, or any kind of situations they can/cant handle. The only time i would ever reccomend a book to be pulled off a shelf or have removed for good is when a school makes you read a book that would offend you, or your culture, or ways of life. And this isnt with just books this is with music, movies, magazines, etc. But my main opinion of this whole subject is that we know what we can handle and if we cant handle a book, or a song, or a magazine, then we shouldnt consider looking at, or listening to, or watching. That is my opinion about weather or not i think that a book, or a song, or a movie should be removed if it is found offensive"	6740	6741
4860	2	"Sometimes I ask myself the same exact question. I ask if I think something is appropriate or not. People usually don't have a choice if they wanna see inappropriate things or not. It is just shown to them in an advertisement, article, or even said in a song. At the same time, some people like to see these things and are immediately attracted to them. That is why people put these things in advertisements.     Most advertisements that you would see on the television these days include sexual content or bad language which shouldn't be allowed. The reason you would find these things in an advertisement is that most people think its funny or they really like it. I personally like to see some inappropriate things in an advertisement but sometimes they get carried away with what they put in them. The ones that get too carried away are the advertisements with sexual content in it. The viewer should either be warned or not see the content that is in the advertisement. If they don't want to see it then it shouldnt be on there.     Overall, I think that advertisements need to cool down. And by cool down, I mean they shouldn't be able to show or say as much as they do in the commercial, article, book, or song. There could be little children looking at your advertisement and getting in trouble with their parents and possibly ruining their future. Allthough there are some parents out there that don't mind if their children see these things. I personally would think that it was unacceptable for the children to see it. They usually do not have a choice to see or hear the explicit content in these advertisements. Advertisements should not be allowed to show this content if there are people out there that don't want to see it."	6742	6743
4861	2	"I dont find almost anything offensive unless its about religon. If its isn't that then i might not care for it. The world as one, as one has many thing that have happend that has offended many. But all that has made them either stronger and to view the world diffrently than others. As this nation from others have offended many.     Books and life are like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. They must balance to become one, as music and teens. Peace and hate are not so balances in the world that is why we are how we are. Like if they are offensive to like a mother, then why can't she just walk away form it and ignore it, unless if has blood and nudity then it must come down.       I for one don't take a side, and for the last of this. Why are you writing it in the first place? How come you don't edit and review what you have made and ask someone if its offensive. It dosen't have to be what they wrote as well"	6744	6745
4862	2	"I think that censorship is a bad thing all the way around. People write books, song lyrics, make movies, and write in magazines to express theirself on how they feel about something. Libraries should not have to take a book off the shelf because a indivdual getting offensive over it. A book, or a song @MONTH1 have words in it that is racist but look at it thought the book writer, or the song makers eyes.     I also think that book from/about the slavery days should be in schools, so that students can become more educated about the past history. And also how colored people lived their lives as slave workers. I also think that if all the books are getting taken off the shelfs, what do the people do if they want to read a book that someone thought was a bad book, or what if the person took a reading in the wrong way? How is that fair for someone else that @MONTH1 have wanted to read that specific book?     I think that we have the right to say thing that we want and do things that we want but its all has consquenses. the law about '@CAPS1 Of @CAPS2' which give you the right to share your opinion about something. That is all that the book, music, movies, and magazines writers are doing.                                                  Sincerly,                                                            @PERSON1"	6746	6747
4863	2	"who would want there children to look at books that are not appropiate for them? But who wants to remove the books everyone is interested in? So many opions and so many different answers, but we all seem to continue to bump heads. In my opinion I would try to help everyone out but, I would  get rid of things that are offensive and not appropiate for children, but we can't just get rid of everything that is pretty important to others then we would have bigger problems. So how do we fix this problem?      A great place to start at is the public library, everyone goes there so anyone is aloud in and out. So to make things a lot easier for the children to not see the inappropiate and offensing things, they should put the books and magazines in the back were there can not be seen by them. So now everyone is happy, they all get @CAPS1 they want after all.      When it comes to other areas it will be a hole different story, we can't just tell them to put the stuff in the back, because those are the things that they want to sell to the world. People can have many arguments of how they should remove it, but at the end they wont. Even though I also agree they are bad but we can't just please ourselves.We can try to make them put them in an area where kids can not see but it wont last for a long period of time. A better solution for this would to just keep the children from looking at these things and teach them good from wrong, because kids will be kids and will try to find a way to look at things they know they shouldn't be looking at.     This will be a never ending riot beacuse people will have many different opions of this topic and it will continue on in the future. That is @CAPS1 makes it so hard to make things better. So hopefully one day this will end, but I said @CAPS1 I had to say to let my point of view out to the world, so now you tell me '@CAPS1 would you do?'"	6748	6749
4864	2	"You ask me, do I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Do i have the right to make those decisions,or anyone else? Some people like offensive stuff. Can I take that away from them? Does everyone even know the definition of offensive?     Well yes, I think that any material found offensive she be remove from libraries. I know I have several young cousins that go to the library all the time and I dont want them accidently picking up the wrong magazine,@CAPS1,book,or dvd.     I think any movie with nudedy clips or rascism should be banned from librarys because I think its quite disrespetful. Same with magazines, it's one thing to hear about racism and naked girls and women and men in songs or read about it, but see it? that's just a little too far. I know some people enjoy those things because they like porn, or they are racist. But I dont like porn, because its disgusting and disrespectful, and I don't like racism because i'm not rasict and thats just rude.

4865	2	"Libraries are a very useful source of information. They hold information on the past, and they also hold fictional stories. Many libraries throught the @LOCATION1 are being censored for material that is seen as inapropriate. My belief on this topic is that libraries should not be censored.     Books are the main source of information in a library. If a library were to have a censorship over books, then the information in the library might decrease. Books are an important recource when studying, or when reading for fun. There would be a smaller selection of material on the shelf if the libraries were censored. If libraries were censored almost every single book would come off the shelf, because of all of the different ethnic groups, and religion groups, almost everything could be found as offensive. This would defeat the purpose of the library being a place for information on all different subjects.     Music is a growing and popularizing way to express and convey your likes and dislikes. Music is an important part of culture and history. Libraries have music for the purpose of educating the minds of people who havent experienced the type of culture that they are studying, or that they are interested in. There are so many different types of music that it is almost impossible to find music that is not offensive to some people. Music can also help younger generations understand what life might have been like in the past. If Music were to be censored then younger generations of people wouldnot have the complete access of information that they deserve to learn from.     Movies are also a very essential part of culture. Movies can be one of the most useful tools for learning about a specific topic. Movies can not only explain what people think about a specific topic, but they can also show them visually. Movies are a very important tool in a learning process. If movies were to be censored in libraries people would have a harder time accessing the information that they need. Censoring movies would deprive people of being able to experience a specific topic of information in a new way. Some movies @MONTH1 be offensive to people, but to other people they are a good learning experience.      My opinion on the topic of censoring libraries information is that we should not censor libraries. Books, music, and movies are a very important tool to be able to utilize to our advantage. Books have been around for the longest time and have helped explain how events in the past might have occured. Music is a very important tool for understanding the culture of a different ethnicity, or understanding the culture of a different country. Movies can help the person to experience the information they are trying to learn in a new way that music, or books could not do. If any of these materials were to be censored in libraries, the result would be that people would not have the full access to information that they deserve."	6752	6753

4867	2	I personally think that any inappiate material needs to be taken off of the shelves. I think this because if a child happens to pick up this book or they will be curious. They @MONTH1 just keep looking out of interest or they might learn new words. They @MONTH1 even come ask you abhout somethings they @MONTH1 have seen.     This @MONTH1 be bad in many ways first children are seeing things they shouldn't seen also they learn new things. They might try those new things they seen and that @MONTH1 not be a good thing. First some one @MONTH1 hear it or see a child behaving in this manor and they @MONTH1 report you the parent.     Cursing is bad a child shouldn't say curse words and if another adult hears it they @MONTH1 think they child is in a bad environment and @MONTH1 need removed. The child @MONTH1 get ahold of a book with porn or something of that catagory and they might repeat something they have seen. This @MONTH1 make another adult think they are being sexually abused or @MONTH1 think the parents are doing this in front of the child.      There are many reasons these bad books and e.t.c need to be taken off the shelves of public libraries. It could cause serious problems with children that dont need to be exposed to this. It's a public @CAPS1 everyone goes there. If anyone wants such bad books they go to the certain places that carry them where little children are not aloud to be.	6756	6757

Books should @CAPS4 be taken off of the shelves just because one little person finds @CAPS3 offensive. If someone does @CAPS4 like a book that much then they should of got a little more background information on @CAPS3 before they read @CAPS3 and dissed the book. @CAPS3 @MONTH1 @CAPS4 intertainment to them but to someone else @CAPS3 just @MONTH1 be what they are looking for"	6758	6759
4869	2	"If you could censor the libraries would you? I would not, because if we could all take an offensive books off the shelves then all the books would be gone. I have three reasons why library censorship is a horrible idea.      One reason is that if everybody could take a book off the shelves because it is 'offensive' then there would be no more books.      Another reason is that every book is probably offensive to someone.      My last reason is that books is where all the knowledge was first put before the internet.     In conclusion, library censorship is a bad idea for a number of reasons."	6760	6761
4870	2	"Would you want everyone controlling what you read, listen to, watch, or even look at? I know I wouldn't, because everyone has there own personality and interest that they like. So why have someone else control you? Some reasons that I do not agree with everyone else taking things off the shelf that they think is offensive is because some people might not think it is offensive, the other reason is because the parents of the children can always control what they read instead of controlling what everyone else reads, and the last reason is because if we control everything there won't be any more music, book, or even movies.     Wouldn't you like to read a book with out someone saying it's offensive, and taking it off the shelves. Well, I would. If we take every book off the shelf that someone thinks is offensive we might not have any books to read. We won't have books to do reports on, or read even for fun. We should not let everyone else control what we read even if they think it's offensive, plus if you think it's offensive you dont have to read it.     So some kids like watching horror movies or reading dramatic things in the magazines. The parents can control that if they don't approve of it. Why does everyone else have to suffer because it's taken off the shelf by the parents, it should not be that way. I know kids can be kids but come on, they are kids you can control what they read, watch, or listen to.      What do you think the world would be like without music, movies, or even books? It would be probably boring. Would you want to be sitting at home without some kind of music to listen to or even movies to watch? I know that I would most likely dislike it, because when I clean I have to at least listen to some music, and if other people get to take it off the shelves because they think it's offensive, what good is that for me? Don't I have a say in what I listen to ?      So why give permission to people to take things off the shelves that they think is offensive? What would you do with out movies, music, or even books that you like or even enjoy? So I say that I disagree on letting people take things off the shelves that they think is offensive. Just think about it. What would you do?"	6762	6763
4871	2	"They should not remove things thta are offensive.Why remove it when as you grow up and get to explore life you will have to go through alot of offensive things.Kids need to learn things like this beacause it would help tech them what they might see in the future.You cant just hold things back music is a way of life sure there will be foul language in it but dont take it away because the kids parents use the same words.Movies they are for enjoying and for bringing people together the kids might see bad things but all you have to tell them is its not real.     That is like saying kids cant watch basketball games on t.v cause they are ruff or even football games,thats also like saying your kid cant play that sport they might get hurt.Well you will never know untill you let then do it.Good and bad things happen to everybody so dont take away ther enjoyment from most people casue thats what you think or other people think.     When i grow up and have kids i plan to let them make mistakes and learn from it and thats cause you have to do that in life.We all understand you are caring for the kids but that will not stop them from doing what they want kids will be kids, and some kids will try to act like adults so treat them like it.Im just saying pretty soon your kids will be adults and you cant always try to hide theem from the real world, you might try but it could lead to mental illness and other things.So just let the kids explore life cause you know what they say you cant always stay a kid forever."	6764	6765
4872	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'         I think that they should be removed because someone like children, teenagers, and adults can get really offensive about what they read. Like for an example for teenagers, they can read about losing weight if they are big or not because some most people think if you want to fit in then you can't be big.     I have talked to a girl once and she went to my old school. And she was telling me if you wasn't to skinny enough or didn't wear the right clothes you would not fit in at all. Well this girl I was talking to she is a big girl, and they said some of the girls would make fun of her and told her she didn't belong at that school. They made her high school years bad because they would make fun of her all the time.     What I  am trying to say is don't let people put you down by the way you look,what clothes you wear, or how you live. You just need to be you and express how you want to express yourself. If you want to wear weird clothes then do it don't let no one stop you how you want to live your life. Because when you least excpet it you will be the one with a good job and a good family and other things like that because you didn't care about what people thought of you. Just keep going, don't let no one let you down or offened you in anyway."	6766	6767
4873	2	"Authors and @CAPS1                          Should @CAPS2 On the Shelves     Should materials that express oneself  or something be removed? Freedom of speech should be in that category. It's not against the law to express the way you feel. So, why should those authors, publishers, artists, and @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves?      I remember when I was a young kid and my class read about @PERSON1 and he had a right tell the whole world how he felt. Some people did not agree with him, and other people standed by him. But it was a freedom of speech. He expressed himself; like those authors, publishers, artists, and @CAPS1 were expressing themselves.     When they released their novel, magazine, record or film to the world; no one told them that their work was going to be taken of the shelves because it affended people. Maybe thats the reason why they wrote their novel, magazine, record or script to get their message out into the world. Everyone can't be like @CAPS3 and express themselves on national t.v.      If people are so affended then they shouln't go to the section where they found that novel, magazine, record or film. I've been in a library before and last time I checked they were organized by genre. So those people can ignore those books, magazines, records, and films that affend them--other people might take interest in those subjects.      Sould materials that expresses oneself or something be removed? No it shouldn't, because those authors, publishers, artists, and @CAPS1 worked very hard to get there voice out to the world. They succeded their goal in doing that. If libraries take their work off the shelves then there is no reason in writing a novel, script, article, or singing their newest hit. With all respect I don't think libraries should remove their work."	6768	6769
4874	2	"Censored items in libraries are found offensive to some of the people that go there.  People feel like the @ORGANIZATION1 should have nothing but books, information, and a way to relax on a @DATE1 @TIME1.  Although I @MONTH1 feel like it's not a problem, it definietly causes me some problems for children to see it.         Here is a story that happened when i was younger in elementary school.  @DATE1 visits happened frequently in @CAPS1 family when i was younger.  @CAPS1 family and I used to get up around nine and eat breakfast.  After that we would go up to the @ORGANIZATION1 for our weekly book that we got every week.  As soon as we pulled in I remember racing out of @CAPS1 moms car and sprinting to the door.  Walking in was amayzing!  The @ORGANIZATION1 was the name and it had marble statues, polished wooden floors, stairways leading up and down.  There were never ending waves of books.       But one day was different then the rest.  There was a door that had adult only written above it.  When a youngling comes across a gigantic door that lets only certain people in, you know they're going to be curious.  I said, '@PERSON1 have you ever been in there?'  @CAPS1 brother replied, 'No, it says only adults can go in there.'  '@CAPS2 since no one is around do you want to go check it out?' I said.  'We better not mom would be furious if she caught us.' he responded.        '@CAPS3 me you will not go in there,' @PERSON1 said.  I promised him and walked to the kid books.  Nothing was going to stop me from going in that door.  Sneaking @CAPS1 way from bookshelf to bookshelf i found @CAPS1 way back to the door.  Walking in was like something I've never seen before.  Row after row of naked people and censored videos.        Apparently @CAPS1 brother had seen me go in and was waiting for me to come out.  @PERSON1 had been in there before kind of the how I did.  Curious, rebellious and doing your own thing is exciting but can get you into some serious trouble.  Because @CAPS1 brother went and told @CAPS1 mom which made her go ballistic.  No one under eighteen should be aloud in there she said.  Grounding me for a week was punishment enough.       So reading this story is a perfect example of why you should not have that stuff.  It's simply inapropriate for children period.  As you become more mature and are able to handle nudity and censored items like that then you have the opportunity to do so.  Do i feel like it should be allowed?  Probably not because one day you will be with the one you love and realize you never needed any of that at all just the one you love"	6770	6771
4875	2	"I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Just because you dont like a book because of what it has to say in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken off the shelves. Everyone has different interest in different things such as books, music, movies, and magazines so if you dont like it that doesn't mean somebody else doesn't.     If you don't want your children getting into all the things you don't like that the library has on there shelves then dont take them to that library. I think people take things to far with trying to get things removed from places just cause they dont like what it is. If you dont like something then just put it down and go on with something else and someone who really likes it will come and take it.      If i didn't like a book that talked about drugs and things like that and you liked it, how would you feel if i was trying to get that book removed from the library? I dont think you would be to happy about it. what im trying to say is just cause you don't like something doesn't mean that someone else don't like it and won't have fun with it. thats why i don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive"	6772	6773
4876	2	"I personally believe that anyone can write whatever they want.  If someone finds a book on the shelf that they find to be offensive, they don't have to read it.  If they choose to read a book that they don't like then it's their fault for reading it.  If the author of a book found out a local book store had removed the book they wrote, I think they would be pretty mad and they would possibly stop writing because they think people don't like what they write.     You shouldn't worry about censorship if it doesn't relate to you personally.  The only way someone should be able to remove your work from being published or released is if the story talks about someone in particular in a bad way enough for the person to find it offensive.  One time I was at my local book store and a younger lady was looking down at a book that had a title that offended her.  She went and told the librarian and the next day the book had been removed from the library.  You shouldn't be able to do that.  If the lady found the book to be offensive she shouldn't have looked at it, she should have just ignored the book and kept on with what she was doing.     In my opinion, censorship is not acceptable.  People should be free to write what they want.  The author of the book shouldn't be blamed for writing offensive material, it should be the person finding it to be offensive that has the punishment.  If you don't like the book then don't read the book."	6774	6775
4877	2	"I think that certain books should stay on the shelf. One of the reason's that I say this is because they help us understand things better. Books also help us locate something if we can't find it on our own. Some books on the shelves @MONTH1 also be very old, or possibly falling apart.      Books @MONTH1 be very useful in helping us understand things better. For instance, if we need help on homework we could look it up in a book. They also help us understand things better by giving details about something.      Some books have been very useful in helping us find things. Like, if you can't find a street or something some books have maps that shows how to get there. They also help us locate where we can find answers at if we can't find them.      Books have been around for many years. So some books @MONTH1 need to stay on the shelf because they are very old. People might have books that have been passed down to them, and the books might be falling apart. These books @MONTH1 also need to stay on the shelf because they don't want them to get ruined somehow.      Why do you think that books should stay on shelves? Well, these are just some of the few reason's why I think books should stay on the shelves. Many other people might have more reason's than what I do"	6776	6777
4878	2	"I believe the libraries should keep the books, movies, music, and magazines on the shelves. They are enhancing the vocabulary and minds of children and adults. People would understand more about the world we live in. We are free to express our feelings in books, movies, music, and magazines.     It enhances the mind and vocabulary of kids and adults. When we read something from the magazine we usually want to share that information with other friends, kids read @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because @CAPS1 interest them. Back in elementary school I know for a fact that my friends would only get @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from the school because they didn't have to pay for it. Libraries shouldn't remove the shelves at schools or public libraries. Kids' @CAPS5 magazines are good for classes at schools as well because they have straight facts and teachers could give quizzes on them, and it gives a better understanding to kids. Adults can get novels and magazines from public libraries and they can teach them stuff that they have never heard or seen of. It could enhance everybodies mind and vocabulary. We do it everyday.     People would understand what world we live in, and how we are affecting it. @NUM1 is a good example for this. I was in kindergarden when @NUM1 happened. I didn't know anything about it until the @NUM3 grade. Everybody was still talking about it and I felt dumb for not knowing what evrybody was talking about. So i got a @CAPS5 magazine and read the whole thing cover to cover, I read about @NUM4 of them until I found out what it was. When I found out I about cried because I was little and I was starting to put peices together. I went home and asked my parents if we had family over there, they said no. I still felt bad. It heightened my emotions and I found out we were at war. It makes us who we are today with a library and all the information from the books, magazines, movies, and music.     We have the freedom to express ourselves in whatever shape or form, but mainly in music and movies. Movies can creat a person and so can music. SoI think only appropiate music shoud be on the shelves in the library.     I guess what i'm trying to say is @CAPS6 all the books. magazines, movies, music, etc. we wouldnt't be the people we are today. Would you be the person you are todaty @CAPS6 this stuff in your local library or school library? really, think about it."	6778	6779
4879	2	"Censorship is not only a problem that newspapers are facing and is becoming more prevalent in libraries and book stores. All across the country, book/music/movie carriers are taking certain books and other materials off the shelves that they deem inappropriate for their clients. The problem is, even if that book is taken out of a store, that doesn't mean is in accessable. Also,  shouldn't the library or media store simply move the books and materials so children @MONTH1 not get ahold of them. Whereas adults who @MONTH1 enjoy whatever that piece of entertainment @MONTH1 be, will be able to check it out or buy it, thus the stores or library don't lose any customers either.      Libraries are generally in charge of buying or ordering the books or other materials they want or chose to hold in their facility. Because they are giving this freedom, the administrators would already have an idea of what they would or wouldn't want to buy, depending on what they believe would be appropriate for anyone using the library. Therefore, the library shouldn't even have any material to be thought of as 'offensive' in their system. If something isn't generally accepted as offensive, the library would most likely carry it, and it would be up to the parents' discrestion to determine what their children are reading, not a library.       As for various stores selling books, or music, or movies, they should simply move the materials to an adult only section in the store, and/or make the customer produce an @CAPS1 in order to purchase that item. Though this @MONTH1 be a hassle, it prevent unnecessary censorship and infringement on our rights guaranteed by the @ORGANIZATION1. If this causes the sale of that item to go down, then many stores @MONTH1 not carry it, or the company would get the hint that their song, book, movie, magazine, etc. was too sketchy for the public, and possibly @MONTH1 prevent its likeness from reoccuring. The problem then just solves itself, and censorship doesn't have to come into play.     Another point, said in the quote from Katherine Paterson, states that even though you @MONTH1 want a book removed, if everyone removed a book they deemed inappropriate, then there would be no books left to buy or read. The same thought can be applied to the new music we listen to, where if we all were able to prevent a song from being recorded based on whether or not we find it offensive, we'd have not music, and such follows with movies and magazines. The problem with censorship is that there is no clear cut line on where to stop, meaning if one thing gets censored, it could end up being completely changed or completely removed. This could also lead to censorship bleeding over into that genre of book or music or movie, and that whole genre would end up censored or cut. There is just no clear cut end.     As a person who has been or is a teenager, one would no that with today's access to the @CAPS2, censorship inadequate. Even if a child is prevented from reading or listening to something, now days they can just look it up online. The stores and libraries @MONTH1 try to rid of offensive material, but in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, once it's out there, it's out there. Kids will find ways to access something even if they can't legally buy it or aren't given permission to read it. Therefore, it becomes the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids read and listent to, and to install their own limits on the @CAPS2 they receive, and not the store or library who merely carry what will either make money or attract customers.     There is only so much that can be done to shelter people from offensive material. The fact is, offensive material exists, has existed and will probably always exist. Everyone has a right to publish or read what they will, and the opposite (not publish or read what they will) is true. The cold truth is, parents now will have to step up their ideals for what their child is exposed to, rather than rely on society to do it for them. We are all given the right to read, say, and publish what we want, and even if we don't agree with the material someone else has produced, we don't have a right to completely censor it. The best we can do and hope for is sheltering our children from offensive material, which is really no responsibility of a store and little responsibility of a library. As a newspaper, the views on censorship are very harsh, and should be in any case of censorship in any other print or media setting."	6780	6781

4881	2	"Censoring anything these days is a huge deal. To me it seems the stuff we are censoringhas already become a part of our everyday lives. I can't even walk down my high school hall way with out hearing someone droppin the @CAPS1-bomb. I mean about one fourth of my school has some sexual experience already; @CAPS2 of my school has either drank or done some kind of drug. I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm simply saying almost every teen knows about these things. So censoring anything these days is almost pointless, but is for a good cause.       Almost every good book that has been written contains sexual content, violence, swearing, or alchohol and drugs. I think these things are interesting to read about. It kind of gets readers hooked. I can't remember a book that I've read that didn't contain any of these things that was good. There are very few books these days that don't contain swear words, sexual content, or drugs and alchohol. I think that most high school students are mature enough to handle this problem on their own, if they think the book is offensive they can turn it in and find a new one.     Today there are very few @CAPS3 rated movies that dont contain nudity, drug refrence, violence, or sexual conent, in fact there are very few @NUM1 movies that don't have these things in it. Once I was watching a movie with my mother, and three minutes into the movie there was already nudity. These movies are just becoming a part of our everyday lives. If parents want to keep their kids safe, they might want to watch the movie by themselves first to make sure they want their kids watching it.     The music these days is very different than the music our parents and grandparents listened to. There are tons of different genres and more than @CAPS2 of them refer to sex and drugs. Rap is becoming very big right now. And the lyrics mainly consist of swearing, sexual intercourse, using drugs, or alchohol. It's hard to find a song on the radio that isn't censored. There is an artist that is very popular right now, and about @PERCENT1 of his songs are about smoking weed. And it's hard to keep people from listening to music, becuase all someone needs is a computer and they can listen to anything they want.     These days its hard to censor things. There are some things I agree on censoring, but there are some things that people need to lay off on. These things are becoming part of our everyday lives. And it's hard to get used to and some people will never get used to it. The generations have changed, and will always keep changing."	6784	6785
4882	2	"I don't that the libraries should take awy the books, movies, or any other materials.    What if their little kids want to watch a movie or something and they can't because all of the materials are gone. I think that the librarians should keep all the materials.    Maybe if all the libraries would all get together and pass out flyers to the people in the community; maybe the libraries would be saved. I think that the neighborhood would like to help the community keep the libraries the same as they've been for many years.   I don't know why parents are trying to take over the libraries the parents should have control what their children watch ,read ,the music, and books they read.I think the parents are really over reacting because children need books to learn how to read ,and listen to music if their bored.    All parents should pick their children movies,music,and magazines they look at and watch, and listen to"	6786	6787
4883	2	"The first thought that comes to my mind when I think of censorship is control.  This is because that is exactly what it is, people are telling other people what they can and can't write about. If that book, newspaper or whatever it @MONTH1 be is not approved of it is then removed from shelves of public libraries, thus never giving us the chance to learn from it.     Recently I have had personal experience with censorship, in my sophmore english class we read 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'.   This book has attracted a lot of censorship over the years. That is becuase many people find the book very offensive.  I understand how people would find offense in the language used and the way certain people were treated in the book, though would the book be near as good if people talked more like we do today, when the book was set for the @DATE1?     I am not just saying that we should keep certian books just becuase the language in them makes them more interesting. These books give us prime knowledge as to how things were way back when, when there was slavery and there was a lot of offensive words said, but these words weren't so offensive then.  This day and age we know that people are to be treated equalling and with respect so we know to looks past these small meaningless words.     Now we all enjoy the child story '@CAPS3' right?  Well it appeared to me that not everyone did enjoy it.  As I was looking up facts about censorhip when I was doing an english project, I came across a website that showed some books that had been censored and I found '@CAPS3'.  I was dumbfounded at first becuase, what could be wrong with this amazing book(that soon became a movie)?  Well the reason it was censored is becuase in the story @PERSON1 runs off into the jungle with @CAPS3 and they weren't married. I know little children can be rather curious and I know that sometimes they see something and they want to do it, but I know that running off unmarried is not one of those things.      Children read books for the story, not to analyze everything about the book.  It lets them imagine and it opens their minds up to new and interesting things!      I have gained many new things from 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' one of them is that this book strengthened my want for everyone to be treated equally and fairly.  Books should not be censored if there is valid information in them that allows them to show how things are or were even if it is offensive.  After reading the children's book '@CAPS3' when I was young, I have found that even though @PERSON1 runs into the jungle with @CAPS3 I'm still here learning about the way a proper young women should behave and not off in some jungle somewhere living with a man I'm not married to.     When it comes to censorship things are censored way to hard, even though many things in books can be offensive doesn't automatically give the need to take the book off of the shelves of libraries.  People can not hide themselves and their families from everything that @MONTH1 have the potential to harm them,  they need to just grit their teeth and bear it."	6788	6789
4884	2	"For some people, a local library can be where they spend most of their time. Everyone remembers going to the library as a child, and picking out your favorite book to read. The wide variety of different subjects or stories found in these books are practically endless. There is one question, however, that many people wonder about the library. Are some of the materials- such as books, magazines, movies- too offensive to some people? I believe the offensive material in libraries should not be removed, however, it should be isolated to one particular spot, so everyone can know which area contains the material.      There are many reasons I believe this. One reason is that I believe that some materials are not ment for children and some young adults to see. The least a library could do is keep one section for just the children, and another section for the potentially offensive materials. However, the responsiblity of keeping the children from wandering near the offensive material should be in the hands of the parent.      Another reason that the offensive materials should be one held in a particular section of the library, is that sometimes young adults, or even adults, can unknowingly pick up a book that contains offensive material. I'm sure that nearly all of us have been in a situation in which we started reading a book, and the story ended up to be something completely different from what we expected. If the offensive material is held in one section and contains a warning, this will not happen.     One reason I believe the material should not be completely removed from the library is illustrated in the shown quote by author Katherine Paterson. If a person could just remove a book from the library because they thought it was offensive, then more and more people would start doing this. Then, before we know it, there would be no more books left to check out.     All in all, I do not believe that the offensive material should be removed from the library. I do believe, however, that the offensive material should be kept in one section of the library, so that no one accidentally picks up a book/magazine that contains offensive material."	6790	6791
4885	2	"'@CAPS1 me liberty or @CAPS1 me death!' were the exact words from a man who wanted freedom to express himself, then if he can have this freedom, why can't we? For the material that gets sent to libraries @CAPS2 of freedom to all students who choose to read it, for those who don't want to read it @CAPS2 up too them but, why take it away from all? On the other hand some can say that for the books and materials that are in the libraries does provoke those too read it becuase of the interest they have. As a teenager I can relate because when my parents or teachers tell me not to do something, your mind tells you different. For the books to be in the library @CAPS2 of great concern to some, but can be the smallest problem to others.     Censorship in libraries @CAPS2 getting of great concern to many parents, guardians, and teachers. They don't want the children of today to be drawn into books or materials that are negative in any way and @CAPS1 out the wrong message. These things should not be allowed into the public libraires, but be bought by those who choose to read it. When a parent sends little @PERSON1 off into school they want to be certain that he will be encouraged to learn positive things, not knowing that he will have the option of walking into the library and picking up a book that @CAPS2 negative in every way. In that situation parents want to be assured they have nothing to worry about, but in todays society, every child @CAPS2 at risk.     In my own opinion I believe censorship in libraries @CAPS2 wrong and does not @CAPS1 kids the ability to expand there knowledge on other things happening around them. For parents to be so concerned, that they are willing to fight censorship in school libraires @CAPS2 in my opinion disrespecting the freedom of speech itself. Those parents should have raised there kids right to where they don't want to be provoked or interested in negative writing. And for these things to not even skim there mind and keep on living there lives. These books, magazines, articles and etc. were all written by those who believed in the freedom of speech and wrote it for othes who have the same beliefs as they do.           These materials should not be of concern to anyone becuase you should have the mind set to know that it @CAPS2 wrong and to just leave it alone. And too let someone who does like it read and or listen to it. For those whose take offense to the materials I believe should not even care about it. It @CAPS2 there own choice to rather read or listen to it. And for them to listen or read it and say they don't like it but keep on doing it anyways @CAPS2 contradicting there own selves.      So for censorship on materials that enter libraires @CAPS2 forsure going to be an ongoing thing that many @MONTH1 try to battle, but in the end I know where I stand on this topic and so do many other people who strongly believe that it @CAPS2 wrong to keep such materials in the chool enviroment. But the true question throughout this whole essay @CAPS2 where do you stand?"	6792	6793
4886	2	"I don't think that they should remove books that some people think are offensive. People like reading books about all kinds of topics. Most of everything in a book can happen in the real world and it's your choice to read it or not.          If you think a book is offensive in anyway, why pick it up? In most circumstances, the books that have any offensive language or pictures are set aside so people who enjoy those books can find them apart of every other book.           Certain things offend certain people. I'm a teenager and most of my age group like books and movies that are exciting. For an example, the @ORGANIZATION1 series are very popular to teenage kids. The books and movies have inappropriate language and other material that might @MONTH1 offend some people but it's how the person looks at it.     If you have kids and you don't want them to see movies or read books that are offensive, don't let them. It's your choice what you read or watch. They have it labeled on most movies or books that tells if the content is offensive at all. So in my own opinion, they shouldn't remove offensive books, movies, and magazines from the shelves because certain people like certain things and thats never going to change"	6794	6795
4887	2	"Do you think there are books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to you? Well I do, some things @MONTH1 be offensive to you while it is not to someone else. In this esssay I will explain my position on the subject using my own experience, observations and through reading.     First, let me start with my own experience. When I was about five or six my family lived with a friend and the friend had a book that my mom considered to be offensive to me at a young age. I ignored my mother and read the book any way and come to find out she was right.     Second, I will talk about the observations I have made on the subject of offensive material. When I was in @CAPS1 grade in @CAPS2 class at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the teacher, @PERSON2, was trying to think of a book to read to the class and I made a suggestion. She said that the book I suggested my be offensive to some of the other students. I was to young to understand what she meant so I asked, she explain as must as she can so that I could understand.     Third, I will talk about reading. I have read a lot of book in my days most of them do not talk about how things are offensive to others but some do. Though reading the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 series I learn that some spells are offensive to other students. The three unforgivable curse are used with @PERSON3 and his death eaters and are offensive to @PERSON1 and the rest of his friends at @ORGANIZATION1.     Now we come to the end of this essay. To recap I have talked about how materials can be offensive to other people.First I talked by how my own experience show me how things are offensive to other people. Then I talked about the observations I have made. Then finally I talked about the things I have read that showed me things can be offensive to other people. So when you think some thing is offensive to you and you want to get rid of it take it into consideration that it is not offensive to other people."	6796	6797
4888	2	"I do not believe that certain materuaks, such as book, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     When I was in @LOCATION1, I used to use the pablic library. The library had my favorite books which were love story. I really liked to read love story because they makes me auspicious feeling. I went to the library every @DATE1 and I read many books. One day, I realized that there was no love story books.  I asked a librarian and she told me that someone is found offensive by love story books.      I think everyone has exactly rhe same right. In this case, I would like to say that the person had a right of choosing a book to removed which he or she found offensive. But if someone did that, some people would be dissapointing. So in the public library, they should not be removed from the shelves even they are found offensive."	6798	6799
4889	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so dose everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' ---Katherine Paterson     @CAPS1 quote is true in many way. If everyone takes a book off the shelf that they dont agree with or that they might find affensive then there will not be any books left on the shelf, because everyone has there own beliefe or opinion on different subjects. I dont think everyone sholud have the right to take a book off the shelf just because they dont approve of it.      People know what they believe in or dont believe in. It should be there choice if they read that book or not. You can't controll what people like to read beacuse everyone has their own opinion. If people got to band books that they dont like then it would be a insainly boring place. What is @CAPS2 or even the @CAPS3 without stories. There would'nt be anything to talk about because there is nothing that you are going to get everyone to agree on. There will always be somebody that dose not like what you are doing or saying.     There is a more intelegent way to handle the situation of people not wanting there children to read some books. Leave that decision up to the parent or caregiver of the child. If you do not want your child to read a book then you as a parent have that right to say no to that certian book. It is the parents responsibility to teach there child the values and morals that you have.        Not all parents are responsibile thougth and some will let their child read whatever they want, but that is where the teracher comes in. The teacher should also have a say in what the child reads. Maybe not at home but at school the teacher should make sure that they are protecting the children form book that they do not need to read. Everychild is different so let the teacher make a disicion at school on what they think that the child is mature enough to read if the parent is not setting the example for them in the first place.      In the child point of view i know that i would not always want someone telling me what i can and can't read. It would feel like i had no freedom and that i was always being controlled. If everyone had the right to get rid of books that they did not approve then it seems like more children would want to read those books just because they were told not to.         If everyone takes even just one book of the shelf there will be no more books to read and @CAPS1 place will be boring and simple. I agree that not all books should be read by children but that dose not mean they are not good books and that they dont serve a purpose in what they are saying. If people do not want there child reading a book then it is their responsibility to be a parent, And children want to have a choice on some things such as reading. Over @PERCENT1 of books are not wrote for children to read"	6800	6801
4890	2	"In this passage I have just read about censorship is about how kids are getting offensive over books, movie, magazines,and music. I will write about how the kids could be getting offensive or up set with all the material (movies, books,and music). Also how the kids might be getting the materials . Maybe even how they are feeling after the material.     First of all, how the kids could be getting offensive of the material. The material might have raceism in it, or just really bad things that kids at that certain age should not be watching. Furthermore, the music that they might be listing to might have alot of bad words in it or even talk about bad things that kids at that certain age should not be learning. The books at the library could be the same way as music, and movies they all could be offensive to some people in different ways ,because the book might go into detail. All in all, evrybody get offensive over different thing and for this case parents are offensive over this because, they want to make sure that there kids won't go down the wrong path.     The second reason for censorship is how the kids might be getting the material ( music,movies,and books) that are unsutiable for their age. The kids might get the music from the internet ,and there parents dont know about it then they might walk around say those words that are bad for there age. For instence, when I was little my parents were the same way and my parents were right about it.The books at the library should be full of all kinds of thing that are not suited for kids, so I would talk to the librarian to make sure none of that stuff gets checked out of there. All in all, most kids are good at not going this, but i would make sure it won't happen for good.     The third reason how they kids might feel after they hear the music, or watch the movie, or read that sirtin book. The music when i was little was just like to same music now , but my parents would not let me listen to it because of all the bad language. The books might show them how bad of a person they might be if they act  like that. The movie might show them how a person that acts like that might in up in life. Most movies and music are not like that.       In conclusion, I wouldn't take censorship to far unless you know that you'r kids is going to act like that"	6802	6803
4891	2	"Dear @CAPS1 Your times,     I believe that as a @CAPS2 you have freedom of speech and freedom to control your life. But to a certain point, I do not believe that @CAPS3 should be allowed to rent out books that teach people hatred or racisim. I do not believe that books teach you have to make dangerous bombs or weapons should be allowed in @CAPS3 that just about anybody could check out.     Public @CAPS3 are avalible so almost anybody. Including children, ranging from any age. Books like these contain information that if got in the wrong hands could mean very bad things for the @CAPS2 people.     Education is power and like anything when you have power you can abuse that power. So im asking you to put a cencorship on book like these."	6804	6805
4892	2	"no I don't agree with the statment to a point, because @CAPS1 and @PERSON2 have some valger words in them and they didn't take them down. There are some magazines that they don't put out like, car, guns, hunting, fishing, etc., because these magazines don't have valger words in them.     Have you read the book called @PERSON2 before, if you have read it you would konw that they use the @CAPS2 word alot, but there are some other books that use the @CAPS2 word and there are not put out because those book are not clasic. I some what agree with Katherine Paterson when she said ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken of the shelf. But if I have the right to remove the book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone alse. Are school labrarie has no rules on what books we can check because the more we read the more we learn from them.     The book called @CAPS1 dosn't have any valger words in them, but it gives you a pucture in you mind of what happened to the people during the @CAPS5, and what they had to go throw to live. I belive that this book shouldn't be taken of the shelf, because it is part of history during world war @NUM1 and @NUM2. At first I din't like the book @CAPS1 but near the middle of it it got insuting all of a shuden and i did more and more recherch on it and did a project on it in speech class and I got a good grade on it.     There are other book I can't remember right now so in conclusion I would like to say, dont judges a book by the cover intel you have read the book."	6806	6807
4893	2	"Censorship in libraries has been a heated topic to discuss among many people. There is the argument that it is alright for offensive books, movies, and music to be allowed in libraries, and the argument that anything that could be found offensive should not be tollerated. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed, because if anyone could decide that a piece of material was offensive, there would be no material left on the shelves at all.      It is only fair to assume that parents want the best for their children, meaning protecting them from something before they think they are ready to handle it. Parents believe that it is wrong to expose their children to a mature subject, such as sexual activity or vulgur language at a young age. What parents need to realize, is that they can not protect their children forever. If parents prevent their children from learning material especially if the child finds the subject interesting, only creates suspense for the child, leading to rebelious behavior. Children, teenagers, and young adults are going to find out about mature subjects no matter what, so why not have them learn about the material in a library? If they learn about the material in a library, they are getting facts. Learning about mature material, especially material that can be found offensive, is better off being found in a library, rather than on the streets.     If censorship was to be allowed in libraries, it would eventually lead to a lack of any type of entertainment possible in libraries. Many people can think of some type of material that someone in the world could find offensive, but if that was to be able to be removed simply because of that reason, there would be nothing left for anyone to read. The people of @LOCATION1 will always be able to find some type of flaw in any topic in the world. People will always be able to find something controvercial in a material that a library posesses. If a libary contains material about history, there could easily be a discription of sexual activity in that book. Does that mean that if someone does not like the book, they can take away other peoples ability to learn about history?      The people of @LOCATION1 have rights. The library is a safe place where a citizen should be able to go and pick out material whether it be to read for pleasure, research for school, or learn many new things through the wonders of a book. The content that is held in libraries is not mean to offend someone. If a book, magazine, movie, or article in a library offends someone, they should not read it. It is common sense that if something is found unapropriate to someone, they simply walk away from it. Americans have the right to say yes and no, so they can say no to something they find offensive. Someone else can say yes, because they find the material enjoyable, helpful, or interesting.     There should be no such thing as censorship in any library in @LOCATION1. Censorship will only create more of a problem if people start to loose their rights, especially people who love to read. The best way to handle censorship in libraries, is to let the people of @LOCATION1 decide whether they want to read certain material or not. Libraries are safe, and nothing in a library is purpously meant to offend someone.  If a book is found offensive to a person, they should simply walk away and let it be read by someone who finds the book interesting. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed, because if anyone could decide that a piece of material was offensive, there would be nothing left on the shelves for people to read at all."	6808	6809
4894	2	"I think that any sexual and cures words book shold be take off the shelf so that little kids do not pick it upthe books off the shef, because if they were to pick it up they would go aroun the school talking about it to other classmate. then you never  know they mght just start doing they stuff if someone older than them to them what it means.  sure to not want my little girl or boy o be reading stuff like that because they do not need to know what the meas or how to do it."	6810	6811
4895	2	"Certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Some of these materials are not to be seen by younger children. They include violence, fornification, and drugs. Children are learning too much too fast from these materials.     Violence in books aren't as common in books compared to music. Young people are affected most by the music that's out today. Artists are always talking about who shot who and how they are going to catch who ever. If these materials are in our libraries then anybody of any age can easily check it out.      You read about fornification in alot of books now and days. Personally, I read my first book involving fornification at the age of @NUM1, which i checked out of a library. Younger children should not be able to just check out any book. These adult books should be taken out of the libraries and sold only in adult stores.     Alot of teens and adults are into the drug life. Many people listening to music and reading books about drugs would make them want to try it. In just about every song that you hear on the radio involves drugs. Alot of  the books in the libraries involve drug related topics.      In conclusion, certain materials that are in these books, magazines, and music are highly unappropriate to be on library shelves. In taking these materials off the shelves, there will be less of a chance of our children growing up too fast."	6812	6813
4896	2	"People think that offensive things are about things that are about sex, or drugs, but not all things are about the topic they are about other things has well. People think those things shouldn't be seen by our children but if you think about it when you were a kid you would try anything to see what your parents were reading, or listening, or seening and must likely you did your children might have already seen what you seen your not sure but they might and takeing away something that will make you happy but others angry you think you are saving yourself and your children but your over protecting them they will find out sooner or later. Katherine Paterson says a quote that gets all of us thinking what we do to protect our children from hearing, seeing, or reading.     For some books there are such things in there that could be offensive to some people, but not all. Its not fair to take a book, music, movies, magazines away for one person that thinks one thing is offensive. When certain people find something in a book, or a lyric to a song, or a line in a movie, or an article in a magazine then they shouldn't read, listen, or watch them if they are going to be offend by it. Katherine Paterson talks about how some people have the right to take books off, they do, but when people think about it its not right to others, Katherine is right when she says 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people are offensive and argue to keep one book off the shelf others will follow and get more books off the shelf then we are left with nothing.     In my life there was a time at our high school library that some adults, and students where affend by this one book, it turn into a tertasafee that cause books to be remove from the library even magazines that metion one little thing about sex to cause the whole magiazine shelf to be taken down, one little article, and it was down. Some students were upset that there magazines were gone that one magazine cause the whole shelf to be taken down, you have the right to do anything you want and say freedom of speech, but people can't just think about themselves but about others and how this @MONTH1 affect others in someway.     Offensive is a little meaning word that can cause so much trouble in a school, or a town/city. I have read articles, seen movies, read books, listen to music that are offensive to me, but I'm not going to go to so much trouble for others to get a magazine taken off the market, and book taken off the shelf, a movie to not be shown in a theatre, or a song taken off itunes to download or make the artist take the song off there @CAPS1. Its unfair to others for me to be happy when I can just not listen, watch, or read anything thats offensive to me. To understand what other people have in their brains are chanlleging but in yours it's simple to understand you have to think what if this happen to you where they did what you were about to do, its unfair to you and you don't like it very much, but you fight for your book, magazine, favorite song, or movie to stay alive for others to injoy.     In conclusion, people have rights to do or say anything to get something of the shelf, but they don't have the brain to think about others and how it will affect them it's not offensive to others just to that one person and that is something that is are to handle but people have to think make one person happy, and millons angry, or one angry and millons happy, that is a question to you"	6814	6815
4897	2	"There are many types of books that are offencive. The shelves of libraries are filled with them. My views of cencorship @MONTH1 be different from some peoples, but it is my opinion. What is considered offencive; religion, sex, occupations, certain topics, curse words?      No matter what an author writes about can be considered offensive. I believe that cencorship isn't possible in a library. They would have to take every single book off the shelves because every book is offencive to someone out there. Everyone wants to read the certain kind of books they like wether it be gory, emotional, meaningful, fictional, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. If the books were cencored it would be harder to find the books you like, the results of that would be less people coming to the library.     The only possible way it's even a little bit possible would be to have an adults section and kids section. Most libraries are already set up like this anyways. When a kid is looking for a book  they are most likely not going to look for chapter books with no pictures. When an adult looks for a book they probably are not going to pick up a picture book.     In conclusion, cencorship is not really possible unless there are kid and adult sections. Children will always have access to things they should not see, hear, or read. The cencorship begins with the parents of those children. What people choose to let their children see is up to them"	6816	6817
4898	2	"I dont think there will be offensive books, movies, or magazines on the shelfs of libraries or other family places but if there are I think they could be taken off the shelf and brought to the person in charge.  But if the stuff is offensive then I think that you should just stay away from it instead of making such a big deal about it.       What would be the point of spending so much time and effort of getting all the bad stuff you don't like off the shelfs. It might be offensive but it might also be history.  So what if your child see's it, thats how they learn about it so they can stay away from it. So what if you dont want them asking you embarrasing questions, thats what parenthood is about.  So why don't people just spend time with their kids and tell them about that kind of stuff and tell them how to be safe, and how to stay away from it, whatever it @MONTH1 be"	6818	6819
4899	2	"Almost everyone has a different opinion. I think we could almost agree on that. So, how do we decide what is wrong or right?     Huckleberry @PERSON1 is sometimes considered one of the best literary works ever written. So how is a book this influential removed from multiple schools and libraries across @LOCATION1? It is such an old book that much of the slang terms used when it was written are now offensive to many people.      Many magazines are fun to read and are not offensive. Educational magazines in libraries include @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or @ORGANIZATION1. Many magazines that seem harmless have advertisements for alcohol, or male enhancement. Most parents try to keep their children sheltered from these type of ads, but when children have access in a public library it is not an easy task.      I believe the best solution is the create a board of elected officials who make the decision. With that plan, more than just one opinion would be used. With multiple people on a board, it would be easier to make wise decisions. Another way to censor libraries that could be effective, is to have the librarian create a list of books that can only be rented with parental concent.      Since everyone has their own opinion it makes dicisions like this tough, but with creative plans and proactive parents, censorship in libraries is possible"	6820	6821
4900	2	"Many people @MONTH1 find certain topics, included in books and other publications, offensive. However, there should be no exclusion of a book because of an opinion of one person. Libraries should have the right to put out whatever publications they feel they public wants to have. A single opinion should not make a book disappear from a library. But, many opinions @MONTH1 be able to change that situation.     I believe that libraries should a sort of flagging system. In the flagging system, readers of that library can suggest that a certain publication is offensive to a group of people, and should be removed. The library should then total up the amount of flags a certain book has, and once it reaches a set number, then it can be removed from the library or set in a seperate section aside from the other materials. This kind of petition system can be very helpful to a library.     A library does not have the ability to know what everybody thinks is offensive. If a library removed every publication that one person thought was offensive; many people would not have anything to read because that is the genre that they enjoy reading about. However, if a book gets a large amount of suggestions that it should remove the book, it could become obvious to a library that it should consider the removal of that book. In my experiences I have noticed that one person can tend to ruin everything for everyone else. If a system was setup to make people provide a valid reason why they want this book to be removed from the shelves, then they @MONTH1 think over what they are doing. This @MONTH1 cause that person to realize they @MONTH1 ruin everyone else's chances at reading that book.     On the slip that a reader would hand into the library they would need a valid argument or reason against that specific publication. A valid reason would give the library a chance to realize what that book's flaws @MONTH1 be. If a library recieves many complaints about the same topic in the same book, they @MONTH1 need to go into a deeper investigation about what the book is really about. The population of the library would have to correspond with how many slips they would recieve before removing a certain publication. People @MONTH1 just end up ruining another person's chance at reading an excellent book, unless a library takes this topic seriously.     In conclusion, this topic cannot be taken lightly. Libraries need to take a serious look into why a book or other materials are found offensive, and if they are found offensive by many people. If a library notices a certain race of people are taking offense to a story the library @MONTH1 need to look into it more than if a certain age group is taking offense to another story. Overall, one person should not be allowed to have their opinion affect another person's chance at a great novel."	6822	6823
4901	2	"Dear @CAPS1,        In most states believing that certain books, music, and movies should be censored in librarys. The people should have the choice though on that should be in librarys, and what should not, cause freedom of speech. I do not want to have any foul language in books, in the music they have in each library, and movies they sell, they should be education not vulgare and degrating. I support the censorship and so should you.          In all of the librarys, you should see what you like the most action, horror, comedy, adeventure, etc., what you do not want to see is racist books, making fun of others, and books that contain excessive cussing. Books are about giving information out and keeping us entertained to read more, learing about history and outer space is my favoirte subject cause there are so many known facts, that just want me to learn more. Cursing in books are unnessary, it only gets your attention for a second, books like these should be thrown out of librarys, cause books are setting a bad exapmle for the young.          Music is a big part of society today, more and more artist are showing up in the world, I am a big supporter in all music, but I disaprove some music in the librarys. I believe the music today should not be aloud in library, cause of what some of the lyrics mean, librarys should be a quiet place for readers and others to enjoy some peace and quiet. The music you want to listen is your @CAPS2, and it should not be blaring so others around could hear. Music offered to you is educational and someone reading it to you.    Librarys, rarly contian movies that are bad to the public, movies in librarys should contain teaching the subject you want to laern and not something you see today in movie theathers. Moives today all are for adults, r-rated, half of them contain sexually, making fun of others, so why would you want to put those in a library for the younger population to see?     Censorship to some books, music, movies, etc., should be the peoples choice, if they feel that will educated everyone else. The choices are endless on which book, music, movie you choice in a library just remember that, if it contians foul language or is degrating, just but right back"	6824	6825
4902	2	"I do not think that materials with offensive content should be removed from the libraries. It is our choice to read or not read the material that is provided at places such as libraries. My reason bing is that some people that @MONTH1 find it offensive should put the materials down, walk away, and ignore it.      Some people find it entertaining to read or watch these offensive materials because it @MONTH1 not be offensive to them. Some @MONTH1 find it as @CAPS1 a joke, but others are to caught up in their own problems that they seem to think those vulgar comments are aimed towards them. Which @MONTH1 be the case in some points, but not all the time.      Most of the offensive things people approach are @CAPS1 for fun, because they know it will catch a lot of people's attentions. Many people @CAPS1 want to have fun. This is @LOCATION1. Let us watch or listen to what we want. It's a free country. If you have a problem with something then do what everyone else is doings and deal with it.     Many religions also see this offensive stuff as a problem. Not to dis my religion or anything. I'm a christian, but I do like to watch stuff other than everything thats 'good'. I mean, it doesn't make me a bad person for watching that kind of stuff, but in all honesty, even if we watch those things it doesn't make it right to repeat it. We do need to be...somewhat modest. Well, at least to give ourselves a good reputation. We don't want people thinking we are jerks or someting of that nature. If the world saught to helping an old lady across the street as a bad thing, but you thought it was a good thing. Would you still do it? Exactly my point. People @MONTH1 think it's wrong to watch offensive things, but some @MONTH1 not.     This comes to my point again. This is @LOCATION1, and this is how our country is. Your not going to change what people do. Especially when it's not that big of a deal. so @CAPS1 let it go and choose good things for yourself and we will choose what we think is good."	6826	6827
4903	2	"I think that censorship in libraries is a good thing. Censorship in libraries, in my opinion, is good because if the child is too young to know what the words mean, they should not even have the chance to be exposed to them. Depending on what age the person is they should not read, write, or listen to anything that should be censored.     I believe that any material that has to do with cursing should be censored. Books are a common thing that has cursing in it. Books that have curse words in them usually refer to any type of slang usage. Music on the other hand is a major item where censorship should be used. Most rap, rock, and hip-hop artists tend to curse or talk about sexual preferences while they are singing.     Movies are also a major item where censorship should be used. Cursing, major sexual preferences, and drug usage is where censorship should be used. Certain magazines also have a lot of things that should be censored. Such as things that have to do with curse words, nudity, and things that show drug usage.     I have had experiences with these types of things when I was young. I did not understand them and still do not know that much, but I should not have even seen those sort of things. The things that a child learns from these things is because the item is not censored. Well, I think, in general, any type of censorship that is used is very neccesary.     I personally think that these types of books, music @CAPS1, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. All items that show any sort of cursing, nudity, drug usage, or any type of these things should either be taken away or put aside in a different spot for adults. Just so the younger children do not get exposed to those types of things."	6828	6829

Nowdays, we should get along with others.            It will be harmful for blacks to read how whites did their people in the past.Whites are reading the books because they want to see if they can use it  against them.  If the little kids get their hands on the books,  it might start something with  blacks and whites then the world would be mess up.          The pictures in the slavery books should be taking out because they discriminate, scare the children, and make them not  trust  the adults around them. So, I think those type of materials should be remove from the library."	6830	6831
4905	2	"There are plenty of books out there that we do not want our children reading. There are some that have cursing in them. Im pretty sure that us parent do not want our children to read the kind of stuff we did in middle school or even the books we might read to this day.      Movies are big things these days. So much sexual contact, cursing, violence, etc. Our children deserve to see better. Once they turn @NUM1 and they live on their own, they can see as much of those 'nasty' movies as they want. We cant stop them when they are out of your care but when they are in your house you have every say so.     Games are the ones that contribute violence when it comes to teenagers or even little kids. So many kids/teens out there are in juvenile detention centers because of their stupid behaviors. But, they get it from what they watch and hear. most kids/teens play games and get all of their violence from the videos games. Also, some kids get the violence from their parents fighting.     I beleive that if they are found offensive they should be takin off the shelves. i have a @NUM2 year old brother who does everything my @NUM3 year old brother does. Its hectic around the house alot because all they do is fight. One minute the @NUM3 year old will be yelling at my mom and the next the @NUM2 year old is yelling.      We have a choice on whether how our children will be raised and how they will act. So if that means taking all the offensive materials off the shelves, then so be it. I know that once my daughter gets older i want her to have a good life and to behave the way she is supposed to.     Thank you for taking the time in reading this. It really means alot to me. I want to change the worlds behaviors"	6832	6833
4906	2	"Censorship of things such as books, music, magazines and movies is nothing but censorship of ideas and opinions. It is not a great idea to do such things to works of art people put time into. Also, these works should not be removed from shelves because people need to be able to expand there minds to other ideas.                                                                           On a personal level, I have read many books in the past that have opened up the creativeness in me. My mind could expand to new worlds and open itself to new ideas. This process is what leads me to do my best and feel free to express my opinons to others. This theft of freedom is what makes the idea of censorship a negative concept.                                               No movie or book should be taken off the shelves because all people deserve to feel the sense of freedom that I do. This spread of ideas can leave the minds of many people full. Just like me, people can feel free to express without fear of judgement of the public.                                                             If an idea of a novel or film is offensive or go against religious beliefs, does not mean it should be removed from the public. Since a work of art is out for the public, does not mean the public has to take it in. These ideas expressed from these novels and films can be taken in or rejected by the audience, if it is read it does not mean it is in the person's life forever. The audience is not characterized by the piece of art, the art is characterized by the opinions of the people. People have the choice to either apply the ideas to their life, or to forget about it the next day.                                                                          That is why the censorship of books, magazines, movies and music should not be applied. It takes away the voice of people and shuts down the idea of freedom of speech. If censorship is allowed, the minds of this world will be left with nothing and their ideas will be worthless"	6834	6835
4907	2	"To one, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to another, it @MONTH1 be just what they are looking for. Is it fair to take away someone else's source of enjoyment because it doesn't suit your taste buds? Most of us would agree that it isn't fair.      A library is a place for anyone and everyone to escape reality into a different world, a book. There are so many books to choose from because there are so many different personalities choosing them. We all want that one book that sparks our imagination, but a book that sparks your imagination @MONTH1 bore another's. Should, then, that book be removed from the shelf? A book you find to be magical and mystical @MONTH1 be demoralizing to someone else. Should, then, that book be removed from the shelf? Let people choose that world they want to dive into! If you're not a fan of a book, don't read it.      There are so many different types of personalities in the world, and most us have come to accept that. With different personalities comes different interests and perceptions, and we must also accept that. Your idea of a good song @MONTH1 be quite offensive to someone else. Should, then, that song be removed from listening to? It's like candy. Think about it, you go to the store and buy skittles because that's your idea of a delicious sweet treat, but not everyone likes skittles, therefore not everyone buys them. Just because not everyone likes them doesn't change the fact that skittles are available to those they interest. So why remove certain music because not everyone likes it? Don't listen to the music if you don't like it.     Passion of the @ORGANIZATION1 is a movie that really touches me, but to some people it's offensive. Should, then, the movie be removed from watching? It @MONTH1 not be the type of movie that interests someone else as it does me; in fact, it @MONTH1 be the complete opposite. But the movie wasn't made to interest everyone. It's expected not everyone will like it or want to watch it.      Just because something doesn't appeal to you doesn't make it right to remove it from everyone. If you don't like something then avoid it. Not everyone is going to like every movie, song, or book. The simple solution is not removing it from the world, because then there would be no entertainment in the world at all. If you don't like something, then entertain yourself with something you do like"	6836	6837
4908	2	"I think that books with bad content should be removed. If someone were to walk into a library and see books that have offensive language on the front cover they would get offended and leave.     I once walked into a library and seen a foul word on a book cover, i told my mother about it and she told the clerk at the counter, she said ' @CAPS1 there is nothing I can do, it is the book makers job to send us books and we put them on the shelf for them ''. My mom was very upset that they could not do anything about what happend. Three weeks go by, we walked back into the library and there were no books, no movies, and no vulgar books on the shelf, we asked what had happend and they said there were to many complaning about it.      Most businesses in our county have some sort of magazine of some kind that has offensive laungage, you can not hardly go anywhere without hearing or seeing it written out. My outlook, is always do what is best for you, if you do not want ot hear that language, then walk away.     The library made a section for people to buy, or check out the books that are @NUM1 years of age and older, people were happy about that becuase their business had come back after they rearanged things. Personally i think that was a good thing they have done, if it were my library, I would have done the same thing. Yes i do take that offensive if i hear or see that kind of language.     More and more libraries that are doing the same thing, the verbale content that is bad, they put in a @NUM1 years of age and older section so thoes that do not want to see do not have to. This is my opnion about the essay."	6838	6839
4909	2	"Do you ever pick up a magazine or book and turn to a page with a very inappropraite picture or material in it? What if I was to say that your kids are exposed to that in there very own school library?     And what about kids getting in fights at school. Kids who also get in trouble because of there to close together or kissing and hugging?     Yes, there are many books in a school library, but that doesnt always mean they are school appropriate. There are many books and magazines. All kinds. Fiction and nonfiction. Some about drugs and some about life. Theres even books that help with school work. But what about those with @CAPS1 and drugs. Magazines with @CAPS2 content that is inappropriate for even highschool kids. Granted, most schools check there contents to make sure there appropraite, but there is always a mistake somewhere or a school that doesnt bother with that. Imagine, some kid picks up the book and starts reading whether to gain knowledge or to satisfy there case of boredom. What do they read? What do they see? These books and magazines in the librarys are not good for our children in the soceity today. We should keep our kids away from @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 content. Having these books open and out to read for our kids in a way to encourage them, so more kids are getting caught in the hallways doing somthing that shouldnt be done.     Therefore, I believe that all books and magazines should be checked for inappropriate materials in all schools. If they are not sutiable for our children then they shall be removed. This will help lead to a safer, appropriate environment for kids and staff of all ages."	6840	6841
4910	2	"Answering the question, 'whether or not libraries should be censored?',  can be tough. I personally believe that censoring libraries is unnecessary for a couple reasons. While some things can be offensive or unappropriate for small children, if they are taken off the shelf then no one can read them. Everyone has a different taste and a different outlook on certain books.     It is true that many things in certain books shouldn't be read about by children. But when children are that a certain age, parents need to monitor what their children are reading and listening to, untill they are mature enough to pick appropriate things that would be of their interest. Parents can tell children about books that they believe they will enjoy, or books with moral value that the child can use later in his life. But in the end, when the children are grown, they have the right to read what they want and develop there own opinion about the books they have read.    Besides, if we censored librararies to the point of letting people decide which books reamin on the shelf, then we @MONTH1 be denying many people some of their potenially favorite books. Like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work that I abhor- then you also have the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone has a certain take on a book they read. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next.      People @MONTH1 find certain books offensive for many reasons such as politics, religion, relationships, or whatever. But people need to read many books in their life, and will figure out on their own, what they think is right to read. They @MONTH1 hate a book you love, and you @MONTH1 love one they hate. We don't have to believe everything we read, but it can be good to at least understand different authors views and understand why they wrote the book how they did. I personally have come across several books that I loved, but my family members disliked and had no interest in reading.      Reading is an opinionated hobby so there is always going to be that book you love or hate. But if you don't think it is right to read that book, then all you can do is voice your opinion to those who care. If you don't like it, then don't read it again, and share your opinion with your friends and family. There is no need to censor libraries and deny people books they love just because you dont share the same opinion. All parents can do is monitor what their children read. Now I can understand a section for explicit content, that only adults can use, but offensive material is not a cause for a book to be removed from the shelf."	6842	6843
4911	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines, internet, should be removed from the shelfs or to be removed form public if they are found offensive? My opinion is rather both answers yes and no.     I do believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and the internet should be removed because some people go in the library and use the computers because they need to, others go inand use it for either illegel matters or to look up items that shouldnt be looked up, expecially in public. Some books should also be kept out of reach of children, expecially the age they start to read because they might get ahold of a book that could scare them and it could change there life dramaticly. The movies, they dont bother me to much because there is no other way to get the movies if u dont ask because there usually in a drawer behind a counter were only a work member can get them out, its a great way because then no one can steal them. Magazines arent my most consern either because i highly bout that the library will carry inappropriate  magazines.     I dont believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and the internet should be removed because some people dont have a computer and would like to use one and when they get that chance, there going to do what they want. The books, people will want to read something totally opposite of what they read before so its great to have a large viraity of book and magazines. Movies are a great way for intertainment, for instense if someone didnt want to rent a book or magazine or they forgot there library card, they can just pay a rental fee for the movie.     My opinion is that if someone feels uncomfertable with some of the items in the library, at least put them in a different room so they wont be in with all the other books, i believe its the best thing to do for a neighborhood citizen.     Now you know my thoughts about the items in the library, i want to know your thoughts!"	6844	6845
4912	2	"Everybody has their own opinion. Whether or not someone thinks a certain material is offensive is completely based on what that person believes. As author Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 some material @MONTH1 be offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 be very useful information to someone else. No one should be aloud to remove materials off of a shelf in a public library.      Most importantly, people should not be able to remove material from a library because someone else @MONTH1 need that information for something important. For example if someone has to do a report on slavery and he or she goes to the library and discovers that someone found that book offensive and it was taken off of the shelf, that person does not have the information they needed. If someone finds a certain material offensive than that person should just leave it alone and not check it out. Everybody has their own opinion on what is offensive, but that should not affect what someone else has the right to view. People should not have the right to remove anything from a public library.     Another reason people should not have the right to remove media from a library shelf is because if everyone had the right to eliminate certain materials from a shelf than their @MONTH1 not be anything left to check out. Due to the multitude of opinions in this world and the amount of people their are, librarys @MONTH1 not have much media left after everyone takes out anything that offends them. For example if every six out of ten people took away one book from a library that contains one thousand books, every thousand people would remove six hundred books from that library. Sounds like alot right? It only gets worse from there. A public library is called a public library because it is their for the public to get information. If people are aloud to remove items from a library, how public is it then?People should not be aloud to remove anything from a public library even if they find it offensive.     Last but not least, people should not be able to take anything off of a shelf in a library because it is their choice whether or not they want to read it. @CAPS1 something @MONTH1 be offensive, it is the persons desicion to read the material or not. If a parent feels that something should be taken out of a library because he doesn't want his kid to read it than what that parent should do is warn their child that they do not want them exposed to that type of material. Another way a parent could prevent their child from being exposed to offensive media is to talk to the librarian about what his or her child has the right to check out. Taking something away from others just so it is not revealed to a certain person is ridiculous. Someone should not be able to decide whether or not someone else is aloud to view a certain media.      All together a public library is a public place to get information and should not be limited by others opinions. Someone should not be aloud to choose what another person views just because they personally do not like that material. @CAPS1 someone @MONTH1 find a material offensive, it should not affect everyone else who is interested in that material. People should not be aloud to remove any material from a shelf in a public library"	6846	6847

Many things are offencive but they are just the truth that happens or has happened in this world, its not all offencive its just the truth.

Many books that I have read have helped me get a grasp on what has gone on when times where tough.     Movies in the libaray are to help people that @MONTH1 not like to read or have a hard time with a visual perspective and cant get the image in their head.Most of the movies in a libaray are the real thing and shares history about this world and how horrible thing had been before there where real laws.     Music in a libaray helps the people that writes the songs tell the story in their own point of veiw. Its not always what people want to hear but its the truth and theses type of things need to stay in libarays to help people learn and progress with the worlds history.When ever I listen to music now in this time I can tell what the artist is getting across its always about whats happening in the world its just another way to tell a story about history and the present day times.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you also have the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                     Katherine Paterson                          @CAPS3 are many books,movies,magazines,movies, etc., on the shelves of our librarys and many @MONTH1 be offensive but lets get real, we've all heard these words before and many people use them. Why is @CAPS6 such a big deal when a book or what ever uses language that you hear everyday? If you don't like the language put the book down,turn off the movie,or press eject on the cd player! Get over @CAPS6!There are people who want to get rid of offensive language material in librarys, but if we do this how many books do you think we will have left on the shelves. If they are worried about their children getting ahold of the books then they need to go with their children to the library because i am positive that all libraries have a childrens book area. Now if the adults are worried about getting ahold of a strongly worded book then they need to grow up a little bit. Books are a very good way to explore the minds of others and to read what other people lives were like. Many authors didn't have a 'peachy cream' life and the way they write there books are the way they express them selves. An example of one of these books are 'A @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' this young boy was always abused by his mother, she beat him starved him and alianated him from the out side world. He was locked in the house most of the time and while he was in that house many things went on. He had brothers but they never got a hand layed on them, they would actually watch in 'aw' of what was happening to theor brother. His father knew what was going on but did little to stop the horrific abuse. Now if this were you, and you wrote a book on what happend behind closed doors, would your language be preppy. No i don't think so!If you remove material from the library then I don't think that librarys wil have many visitors. There are many genras that people can choose from and I fully understand that some books are only for mature minded people, so don't read the book if you can handle the language and ideas of the author. Think of  how many movies there are playing in movie theaters that are rated @CAPS7.  Imagine if all rated @CAPS7 movies were no longer available to anyone. So no more scarry movies for you. You have to be a certain age to see these movies right, so I think that you should be a certain age before you can check out something from the library that is for a  mature minded individual.  Leave the librarys alone and focus on the more important things in life. Stop the violence, lower gas prices, stop polluting the air, lower the drop out rait, make schools a fun safe place for children, get more people to college, provide more jobs. You know; change the world not the libraries."	6850	6851
4915	2	"I do feel that certian forms of media should be censored (banned) from any and all libraries all across the globe. There is one extremely high contributing factor to the corrupt thoughts of our minds, nay, our entire world is what many of us spend intaking into our daily lives and activites. Many of these notions have taken root into how we express ourselves in society, whether it be through books, magazines, music, movies, @CAPS1, tapes, newspaper articles, and anything else the unsuspecting indiviual can pick up off the shelves. Any one of these foul fathomtations could cause such a catastrope that it could send one into addiction. Even burn our fair nation down into ruin bit by meticulous bit."	6852	6853
4916	2	"In these days our librarys hold so much information. Do you think we have too much information in our librarys? Information like music, magazine, and movies are held in our librarys. Some @CAPS2 think that we have too much in our librarys, stuff they dont want there kids to see or to learn. The music is one, there is alot of music and alot of it kids listen to, but also there is alot out there that isn't appropriate for little kids to hear and should'nt be able to get this music. But right now kids can easily walk into public librarys and get this music. Also the posters of the music are up on the walls of the library and alot of them shows the artist smoking or wearing little to no cloths. They need to restrict the age limits and divide up the hallways to adult music down to kid music and take down inapropriate posters off the wall.The books are starting to get inapropriate for little kids two. From murder cases, to romantic love novels, or war books these genres are too old for little kids. So lets just take these out of the library and just have kids books. That fixes it doesn't it? Wrong, it doesn't fix the problem because @CAPS4 read too and the library is public for all ages so that isn't a way to fix the problem. So my theory is to divide the the library into three portions. Adult books, @CAPS1 books, and then kid books that way everyone can get the type of book they want without any trouble and @CAPS2 can bring there kids in and know that they wont see anything inapropriate.The movies have gotten more and more popular in librarys in these past years. Librarys now hold kid movies, war movies, romantic movies, and crime movies. But there isn't any regulations in librarys saying you cant rent this movie. So little kids can just come into the library and get a war movie or a crime movie anytime they want. They need to have them in seperations stating that you need @CAPS3 to get one of the more mature movies and mark them in colors from kids to teens to @CAPS4.So our librarys are a public place I think that we need all this information in our librarys but we need to just restrict the younger audience from seeing all of the library and the  information it holds. Divide it up and have it were the little kids can't see the posters and the music that they shouldn't hear and the movies they shouldn't see also the books theys shouldn't read. But its all there for  @CAPS4 to watch and read and listen to. This is a problem that we need to fix because public librarys are way to important to lose in @LOCATION1. The librarys need to stay for our education purposes. Those our my statements and thats what I think about this growing problem that we face here in @CAPS5 librarys."	6854	6855
4917	2	"Censering Children is @CAPS1     @CAPS2 libraries in high schools have a '@CAPS3 Books @CAPS4' where books the school board @CAPS3 are aloud to be checked out. Most of these books are @CAPS3 because they are 'offensive' or have material not deemed fit for teenagers. Censorship in libraries is trying to protect those whom need to be exposed to such ideas. If adults beilve something is offensive or to radical for school-age children to experience, the children must be imediately shelterd from the idea. The duty of libraries is to open different ideas to the reader, if libraries censor those opportunities no one is benifited.     In writing a book there are many things to consider, like who is the audience, what time period does the book take place in, and how can the book come alive? The author's intention must be thought about. Why did the authour use this phrasing or style, to convey a point to the reader. In 'To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6', @CAPS7 @CAPS8 uses words common in the @DATE2's, but are not acceptable in the @DATE1. Banning the book would do more harm than good; students need to be exposed to what the past was like so the repition of history does not occur. Almost any ethnic group, race, or orginization can take offense to certian words used in literature. With a masterpiece like 'To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6,' the style @CAPS8 uses and the message should outshine the language. @CAPS2 schools have @CAPS3 'To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6', while others have it apart of the ciriculum. The story is part of our country's history and the oppression happened, so hidding it from the youth of @LOCATION1 will do nothing but let them stay ignorant of the world around them.      If libraries took books off the shelves for being the slightest bit offensive, the libraries would be bare. Censorship is good in modesty; for example, most fifth grade children should not read books intended for seniors in high school. If a book is about @LOCATION1's past, then the youth of @LOCATION1 should learn about it in a more real way than a textbook, and live the hardships through another child's eyes"	6856	6857
4918	2	"Should we really hide some material from our children. maybe they are ready for whats in these books, songs, or movies. If they are then who are we to say that they dont have the right to view or listen to that material. I will be covering more in this essay and i will give you my opinion.      Censorship is not the right way to go. Why hide some material from shelves if only some kids cant handle it but others can. Alot of children are ready for some of the materal we are censoring them from. we can not sheild children forever, they are going to have to learn about some of these things some day.     Who are we to determin whether the material is offensive. what we think is offensive might not be offensive to others. You can't take things off shelfs just for children not to read. You are just thining of one part of the people who do go to the library. Its not just children who go to the library. there are many people who go, so censoring shelves would turn them away from the library because the material is only for children      If libraries do want censore things then they should have two different sections, one for children material and the other just for adults material.There for if a child wants a book from the adults section then they have to have an adults there with them to check out the book. So in the end, its all up to the perent to determin whether or not they want there child to be reading or listining to the material they think is offensive or not.     So do i think censorship in librarys is right? No, but if they are going to do it, then they should do it in a better maner, you cant just take things off shelves just for one part of you consumers, you have to think about everybody. in the end its all up to the parent to determin if the material is right for there child or not."	6858	6859
4919	2	"We've all seen a magazine with offensive material on the front, and we are allowed to do so thanks to the constitution allowing us a freedom of press. Different opinions and stories that can be told is what makes the @LOCATION1 so great, because we have that freedom. If we were to remove every item from the shelves it is taking away some beauty of our country, the education of our children and leaving us with very little material left.      People all of the country have different opinions on what is offensive and what they don't want their kids to see or read, some @MONTH1 think a book contains offensive material and another person @MONTH1 not. This @MONTH1 lead to having to remove a lot of different material that could in many cases be useful or even educational. This leaving us with very little items left on the shelf resembling having little freedoms as if we were governed by a dictator.      If libraries start removing things from the shelf more people @MONTH1 become offended. If a library claims to have removed every offensive material off their shelves and a person discovers something that they think is offensive this could just cause further complications. A librarian is not going to know the opinion of everyone that is going to walk through their door therefore making it very difficult for them to determine whether it is offensive or not.      There are many classic novels and textbooks that contain offensive or crude material due to the fact that times have changed. When books are written some things @MONTH1 be acceptable but then decades later times have changed and so has the culture. History is not something you can really remove from the shelves, bad things happened but we can't change the past. Hidding it from our kids is not going to help them learn and benefit in the long run. Sheltering kids from every bad thing will only hinder them when they try to go out into the real uncensored world we live in today.       Our country is a beautiful place with many rights and freedoms and removing certian books, magazines, movies, etc., it would be taking away from our country. Children can learn valuable material from something that someone @MONTH1 considered to be offensive. Our society benefits the way it is with all material left on the shelves"	6860	6861
4920	2	"As we all have heard of the show @PERSON1 well on his show people dish there dirt out by figthting on television. When they fight sometimes shirts are ripped off and pants fall down, and we see their naked body parts. They usually show censored and we know as teens that nobody wants to watch the show with all the good parts bleeped or censord. You get a better laugh when you see the naked body parts and hear all the cuss words the people say.     If we wanted to know something about history or about the gossip going on @DATE1, we do not want it to be covered up or alternated to sound better. If nobody wanted to read that book in the first place they should'nt of picked it up off the shelf as well as even opening it to begin with. I beleive since we've seen and heard almost everything anyway that they shouldn't cover it up like it's new to us. Movies get better ratings when they show alttle nudity and cuss every once in awhile. Magzines are bought more when they say exactly word to word what the celebrities say out of their mouth. Music gets platnium records by thinking about what the people wanna hear.Books get read more by having drama and how people really talk to each other now-a-days. Us as humans @DATE1 like to get the real stuff when we open a book or magazine to read or to turn on our ipods to listen to a song. Most of the books, magazines, movies, and music relate to us in a deep way that we could really understand. They show the hard times and the happy times we've went through. If people dont like they way a book is told you should put it down and find another.If you dont like the way a song is sung switch the song or even better just listen to insrumenatl. If you dont like the way a moie is directed then watch a different movie. You know the saying ' I've got to see to beleive it', well this is true we are not going to beileve something that we dont get to see with our own eyes. We might think they are lying to us or trying to make us beleive it happend a different way. Kids, teens, and adults should watch whats appropiate for their age group. Thats why in the library they split it up into different sections. In the video store they usualy have the adult section blocked off so kids wont try and go back their.      In a books and music its a place where a writers and musicians can express their feeling and not cover them up. Us as human like to know details and you wont get much details if everything 'offensive' is covered up. You should get to know background information about the author, musician, or director and look at some of their past work to decide if you like them or not. If you don't like them dont read, listen, or watch anything made by them. If people find things offensive easily i'd advise you not to even take a step in the library nor walk into a music store or a theather. Stay at home! and if you want to do something about it write a book, create a song, or make a movie that you don't think is offensive to the public eye."	6862	6863
4921	2	"The library have to have all the information they can get. Some people @MONTH1 have a project to do for school and they would need some information. I believe that all the materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should not be removed from the shelves of the library even if they are found offensive to some people.          The internet have alot of information, but everybody do not have access to the internet and some people @MONTH1 not know how to use the internet. The library whould be the second option if people didnt have internet. I also think getting a book and reading about the things you would need is better than just finding the answer on the internet, the internet is basically doing your homework for you. Also reading can enhance your vocabulary. If yu read about things in the book you would probably find out more. The things that are in the books and magazines are there for a reason. People like to learn new things and they could learn them in the books and magazines in the library.      Everybody in the world is different and some people dont like the fact that the library have certain information, but that information is really helpful when you are dealing with something from school or work. Whenever i had a project from school i came to the library to get information and i came across alot of things that i didnt know about, just from reading books from the library.It dosent matter how offensive the books, music, magazines @MONTH1 be to some people in the end they all are very helpful and they would come in handy one day"	6864	6865
4922	2	"Should media be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I have to go with what Katherine Paterson states. I mean if we take off everything that some one doesnt like there will be nothing. Everyone sees things in a diffrent way.     So lets say that im budist, I want to go look at books on the history of it. Well other relgions would say that its wrong and we should remove everything on budism from the world, were does that leave me? With nothing so see back into what I beleave.     Its culture, and if people have anything they dont like removed then what culture is left? There is ment to be media for everyone of all content. Its a must, if we want to learn and thrive off information to make us aware and content.     Every person has the choice to choose what they look at. Thats why everything is out there so people can choose. Why would anyone want to take that from the world.     So no I do not beleave anyone has the right to remove materials beause they dont like them. Like I said you choose what you look at not anyone esle. Its culture simply, thats all"	6866	6867
4923	2	i do not think they should be removed competly. I think they should be put in a special place and not mixed in with all the other books. So wehen someone walks in to the librey and they walk over to the olcae where the offensive books are found they know that they are going to find something thatb might ofend them.	6868	6869
4924	2	"'If we don't learn from the past, these mistakes are bound to repeat themselves.'. This is a term I grew up on and hopefully my children will too.Libraries books have hundreds of thousands of book holding centries worth of information. And this information is crusual for our societies future. But with these many books are the newer generation of authers and every parent has their own teacher styles for their children. Not every parent finds it to be completly nesesary for their children to be resticted from questioning ideas and statment.       In todays society most parents wouldnt want their children reading books with slander on every page. But on the objective some of the most important life changing books do include slanderous words. So the question being should we allow our children the option to explore these many diffrent types of writting. Well im my opinion we should keep these books for the readers choice and not if for the readers choice then for their parents choice.The parents should definatley be allowed to give their children the option to disterict their childrens reading or not."	6870	6871
4925	2	"I personally believe that no matter the content in some movies,music,movies etc that someone somewhere will always find it offensive sometimes more than others.We should'nt be able to just take away these things from people because we dont like, or agree with it.     It is not fair to some people to stop others from watching some shows, listening to violent movies, or even reading bad material.People have their own opinions and because others dont agree doesn't make it wrong.Everyone is an individual with the write to read,watch, and listen to what they want.Someones always going to be a critic and argue about these things, but as I said before thats just their opinion it shouldnt over rule anyone elses.     For example some movies and music show disgrace and blasphemy of certain religions, it should still be sold on shelves and available to the community.So if a preacher complains of it having bad teachings does it always have bad teachings maybe or maybe not, that is for the person watching or listening to decide.Everyone should be able to choose what they want and listen to what makes them happy or is their own personal style.Heavy metal and hard rock is what I like to listen to I enjoy the music and some of the lyrics,and someone else who is more of a classical or country music person they shouldnt be able to say I cant listen to what I love.     I agree with what @PERSON1 had said 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', because if everyone had that right the few critics of everything would eventually eliminate all we have because someone disagrees with its message.If a preacher disagrees and complains about a satanic message and books,the satanist has the same right to complain about the bible.I am a christian so I dont want people to be able to say i cant read the bible, and people of their religion can read what they see fits them.     If for someone reason they pass a law banning certain books, music, movies and other forms of entertainment who ever agreed to this should be banned from society, because their nothing more than a hypocritical individual who feels they have more say than everyone else.All these things are our own ways of seeing or expressing freedom, and freedom of speach nobody can take that away from us.Everthing should stay on shelves, and if the critics jump high enough they'll get over it and accept the fact their opinions aren't inferior to anyone elses."	6872	6873
4926	2	"I have been asked to write an essay to a newspaper about censorship in libraries. I am going to give you my take on the subject and then the take of other people. The big question is how bad could the book really be. The thing is some books aren't as bad as most people think. One of the biggest reason there might be a curse word in a book is because of the setting or the way of that person.     The questions is censorship a good idea or does it matter. There are very many ways to look at it. One of the ways is to think what kind of books would need censoring. I personly think that any thing sexually should never be on the shelfs of our childrens libraries. Now some of the books are ok in my eye. Let take 'To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2' it has a couple of choice words, but nothing series. It has some here and there just because of the time line it takes place in. Now I under stand about some religons, reading words that they don't normaly use, is different for them. It's not like they have never herd it before. I think that most parents wouldn't care about curse word in book, to an exstint. The people that do care seem to take it alittle to far sometimes. As in call the school to tell them what there son or daughter has read at school. The thing is that parents might have never read that book or even know what it's about. They just take it as another curse word.     Now there are many different types of books there are, present, past, and even future day setting in books. Where ever you are there will always be cursing. Not ever where you go someone will through out a curse word, but there out there. In my personal suspective a couple of words are ok but to much is just to much."	6874	6875
4927	2	"You're community library is a place you go to reasearch, check out a movie, make copies, search the web, or start a new book. It is a public place shared with everyone. When someone tells you about a new book, movie, magazine, ect. you can't wait to check it out from the local library. You shouldn't have to have that feeling of disappointment when you realize it's not there. Books shouldn't be removed from their shelves because they seem offensive to others.      The guidelines for what's offensive and what's not is much too broad of a question to come to a right answer. What is offensive to one person might not be to the person next to them. Everyone has different views on different situations, so who gets to make that decision? It is considered speaking for everyone if someone says certain books, movies, magazines, ect. are offensive, when that @MONTH1 not be true.      No one needs someone else to speak for them because they are their own person and can make their own decisions. They can choose whether or not they check out anything from the library. I was at the grocery store one day and I saw these two men holding hands. There we're three teenage girls standing in the electronic department laughing and pointing at them. The two men noticed the girls, but didn't show it. They ignored them and continued on, because they knew that they're opinions couldn't change how they felt. If someone comes across something they find offensive, they should just return it to the shelf and contine finding something else that interests them. Having several books, movies, magazines ect. in the library doesnt mean you're forced to read, watch, or look at them all.      By not promoting certain books, movies, magazines, ect. in libraries many people lose money. Authors want their books in every store and library. If something about the content of their book keeps their work from being promoted, then they are losing money and publicity. Producers who make their movies available for people to watch, and then realize that's not happening because there is offensive content, they're losing money. If a magazine publishes a story that is full of opinons others don't usually agree on, they're content is now offensive and they're losing money. Many more people are affected by censoring in libraries than just those who don't want offensive books, movies, magazines, ect. in their view.      Libraries try to find books, movies, ect. that will please everyone for the most part. By keeping only certain things out they are forgetting about all the other people, therefore it doesn't please everyone. Haven't you ever went to a library and you couldn't find anything at all that sparked your interest? A better solution could be to keep everything in certain sections. If someone finds one of those sections to be inapproprate or offensive, they don't have to look at it. Instead they move on to another section that they seem to like a lot more, and everyone will be happy. This also makes libraries more useful to public, and more people would take advantage of it's resources.      We will all be exposed to things that seem offensive, there is no escaping it. You can't censor you're entire life. Books, movies, magazines, ect. shouldn't be kept out for that reason. If you don't find something offensive in a library, you'll find it walking down the street, or at your work. At some point in your life you have to learn how to deal with it instead of simply taking it off the shelf"	6876	6877
4928	2	"There are many types of books, magazines, movies, etc. in a library. And all of them are made available to anyone and everyone. The idea of being able to remove something that shouldn't be read by your child, in my eyes doesn't mean you have the right to remove it.     In libraries everything is cut up into sections based on what type of reading your looking for. So if there is something that you dont want your child to be exposed to then you should restrict them from going in there. If the libraries removed everything that was vulgar or offensive to people, than they would have slim to nothing on the shelves.      Also what if the thing you complained about was removed, and somebody else needed it for lets say a project or work? And now they can't because you thought it was inappropriate. People shouldn't be allowed to determine what is on and off the shelves. When I was little there weren't things that I saw that I wasn't supposed to see. Libraries don't just stock there book cases up with inappropriate books and magazines. So people shouldn't be so worried about having there kids find something like that.     From this I think that libraries should not have to remove books that other people don't find appropriate. And instead of complaining about it, they should just not allow there kids and themselfs to read it"	6878	6879

Carol believes her children are on their way to obtaining very successful lives, as they are on the honor roll and participate in numerous sports. When asked if she worries about the material her children @MONTH1 pick up at the community library she calmly stated, '@CAPS1 children have been taught to know right and wrong. When faced with a challenge I have enough faith in them to believe they will do what is right.'      The common beliefs of most parents are that everyone should be watching out for their children. As for protection in the library, multiple parents in local towns have signed a petition to ban offensive books and be rid of the potential threat forever.      What these parent are forgetting is that there are people of many ages that use the library as a source of entertainment. Contrary to common beliefs, I believe parents are sheltering their progeny from many of the moral tests in life. To symbolize this I will use a dog in training as an example, the owner must trust the dog has retained the training neccessary for the course. The parent needs not only believe in the child, but in their teaching as a parent, as the child grows the parent should be teaching right from wrong. Then when the time comes to let the dogs run free, parents know their child will behave.       As for solutions in the library, I have been in coutless libraries with age limits in sections. If the movie or book is categorized offensive, it shall be placed in the proper section. In the case that the library is too small to split into sections a parent should guide young children to the correct books and help them pick from an age appropriate selection"	6880	6881
4930	2	"Books Taken @CAPS1 of the Libraries!     I belive the book @CAPS2 should be @CAPS1 of the library. Because the book  uses foul language and it talks about sex, drugs, acohol. Kids shouldn't be reading those books. Really, aren't the school suppose to stop kids from doing drugs and partying??     The book @CAPS2 talks alot about sex. Aren't the school suppose to not have books about sex? I'm pretty sure they aren't suppose too. Even movies too. Kids don't need to read about them. The book talks about this girl(her name is @CAPS4) that likes this  boy named @CAPS5. and he  does drugs and likes sex alot. @CAPS4 hangs @CAPS1 with with @CAPS5. They hang @CAPS1 everyday after school and on the weekends.      So @CAPS5 asks @CAPS4 if she wanted to be @CAPS5's girlfriend? @CAPS4 had to think it about for a while then she finally said yes. They start holding hands and making @CAPS1. While they were in @CAPS5's truck. @CAPS5's asked @CAPS4 if she wants to cuddle underneath the blakent. So like everygirl would say, yes. She moved over there and while they are cuddling, @CAPS5 decides to move his hand inside @CAPS4 dress. @CAPS4 told him to stop. But he never did. He wanted to have sex in his truck and he wanted to have her.      @CAPS5 didn't like that all, he was mad like a lion taking his cubs. @CAPS5 forced @CAPS4 to have sex with him and she tried to tell him stop, no, she even started to scream, kick; pretty much anything she can do. So he decided to rape her. She was crying and everything. @CAPS5 didn't care, he knew excatly what he wanted and he got it.     In conlusion, kids like under @NUM1 shouldn't be reading this book. I told you some of the book and gave you an idea what the book was about. This book should deffitly be taken off the shelf. Kids would think its okay to have sex, do drugs and party"	6882	6883
4931	2	"First off we live in a free country where people have rights.  So if someone wants to go ahead and read, watch, or listen to something that can be offensive to someone else then they have that right to do that.       I believe that the most offensive things in @CAPS1 world have been written in the past. Thats our countries history and if it is offensive so someone then they should just stay away from it.  If you really think about it how are we supposed to learn about our countries past time if all of the articles and book our taken down of shelves. To me @CAPS1 countries past is what makes @CAPS1 country who we are today. The way we came and took @CAPS1 land over and fought for what we wanted. Thats how @CAPS1 country gets it done if someone sitting on something we want we go ahead and take it from them.       I remember back when i was a little boy i was fascinated by old world war one books. I just love all the detail and the war stories the very fine veterans had put into words in a book. When you read an old book you realize how different the time was, how much harder life was and with out that, kids these days will have no known knowledge of that. I personaly think that is wrong. To shade our countries past time from them. Just imagine if that was you, you would have no knowledge of how @CAPS1 country started, who fought for it, all the heroes and all the presidents. could you imagine having to explain all of @CAPS1 to your children, because there not getting the proper education that they need in school.       'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken of the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have excactly the same right and so does everyone else. And the we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote is the perfect example because it speaks the truth and all we can ask for is the truth.  If we had the freedom to just go ahead and take books off the shelf then the people in need of those books cant have them because they didnt fit your lifestyle then all of those people have to suffer because of you.     I believe in freedom and if someone is going to keep me from my freedom then shame on that person.  Because i have the right to read, listen, watch, or act about something that i believe in.   So thats why i stand up for that freedom to learn and i will always be a strong believer in @CAPS1 subject."	6884	6885
4932	2	"I think that any book, music or movie belongs on the shelves at the library.Their are some main reasons on why I think that they should keep books, music and movies. Most of the things are knowledgeable, there are different ways that literature comes in to play and people learn better different ways.     Most of the things that are in the library are for people to learn sometimes entertain but most of the time libraries are used for a study source for people.Taking away material form the shelf that is found offensive is taking away from our knowledge. Some things in life are offensive buts it's apart of history that will better you in the future by knowing.     literature comes in to play in many different ways. Literature comes throughout books, movies, magazines and music so removing those thing from the shelf is taking away from us. Throught books you can feel and visualize whats happening, in movies can see and feel expressions, through music you can hear and feel the different expressions of something.     There are different types of ways that people learn. Some learn better throught books which means there good at visualizing thing's. Some people learn better throught movies which means they like to see what the situation is about close up. Music is also a form of some one that likes to visualize what the situation is they can actually feel the different tones and expressions of the music.      Through all of these things it starts with a book everything that has a book has a movie and everything that has a movie has a book so library should not try to seperate any of those form's of learning"	6886	6887
4933	2	"Some people @MONTH1 think that in our society today such books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored. People think that they should be removed if they are found to be offensive. Right away, the question comes to mind: how do we define 'offensive'? There are three good reasons that books, music, movies, and magazines should @CAPS1 be censored from our libraries. People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they wish; no books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed because each one has its own value in one way or another; and what is offensive to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly acceptable to another.     People have rights, including the right to read, watch, and listen to what they want to. If books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, people are having that right taken away. People should know what they are watching, reading, or listening to. For this reason, people should be able to be responsible enough to choose what they want to check out and leave everything else alone that they do @CAPS1 wish to read, watch, or listen to. Any person should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever he or she wants, regardless if it is found offensive, as this is a personal decision and responsibility. If these materials are removed from the library, this is taking away an important right for all people.     Everyone knows that books, music, movies, and magazines are very important and each one has its own value. Without books, people would struggle with learning, grasping new concepts, and growing intellectually. Books take people to new worlds, ignite images in their brains, and make the cogs between their ears turn as they think about what is on the pages in front of them. Books have an indescribable value no matter which book is picked up. For this reason, books should @CAPS1 be removed for being found offensive. Books that contain value to one person @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be valued by another person, but that person does @CAPS1 have the right to take that book off the shelf. As the quote by Katherine Paterson says '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work that I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We would @CAPS1 have any books left on the shelf if each person took away books that they thought were invaluable.       Lastly,  every person has an opinion of what is right or wrong, offensive or @CAPS1 offensive. If someone says that all offensive material should be removed from the shelves, how does one define 'offensive' in our world where opinions are so radically different from one person to the next? What one person finds offensive @MONTH1 be perfectly fine with another. What one religion @MONTH1 find offensive @MONTH1 be the central belief of a different religion. No one person has the authority to say what is offensive and what should @CAPS1 be appropriate for people. We have no absolutely possible method to define what is offensive or @CAPS1 because everyone's opinions are different, thus, there is no possible way to censor the material in libraries without offending people.     In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should @CAPS1 be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. The facts that people have the rights to view, listen to, or watch anything that they wish; books, music, magazines, and movies have different value to different people; and that there is no way to define which books are offensive to people based on widely differing opinions all lead to the obvious conclusion that censorship should @CAPS1 be allowed in libraries and that no one should be able to take these materials off the shelf. It is one's own responsibility to check out what he or she wishes and to leave alone everything that he or she finds offensive."	6888	6889

4935	2	"Have you ever read a book or magazine or even listened to a @CAPS1.D that was non cencored? I think we all have, its just apart of nature, thats all there coming out with now.     Everybody nowadays is listening to non cencored @CAPS1.D's or watching non cencored movies, I don't think anybody in the @LOCATION1 don't listen or watch movies or even read magazines that are cencored, everything is going to non cencored. If it were really up to me, I wouldn't mind having everything uncencored only because its happening now.      I really don't think that things should be pulled off the shelf in libraries because its not cencored, I think that if they did pull everything non cencored item off the shelf nobody would go to the libraries anymore because they want to read, listen, or watch what they want, they don't want other people telling them what they can watch, read, or even what to listen too. I also think that if they made it a law that the libraries shouldn't put that stuff up on the shelves, that our @CAPS3 will try to fight it to make it not a law.     The kind of music I listen too it's not cencored at all, and I know alot of people that listen to the same music I do, and theres nothing wrong with it. Now I also know alot of people that listen to @CAPS3 and theres nothing wrong with @CAPS3 either, I listen to both. I think every movie out there is not cencored, they all cuss or have bad things in it that children shouln't hear or watch, but if you don't want them listening to it or watching it, then don't watch it while there in the room, wait until they go to bed or they are out side playing, but sooner or later they are going to experience listening to music thats not cencored or watching movies thats not cencored, or even reading books or magazines thats not cencored.     Our @CAPS3 has changed alot back in the @DATE1's or maybe even the @DATE2's everything was cencored and then once we hit the @NUM1 @CAPS5 and when they came out with @CAPS6&@CAPS7 or even @CAPS8-@CAPS9 everything went to being non cencored because the '@CAPS10' wanted to show a point that everything could still be the same with there songs having a few bad words in there and them trying to make a point."	6892	6893
4936	2	"There are many materials in a library, and it is the choice of the individual person if they will read, listen to, or watch these materials. However, most every book will be found offensive to an individual person because of their beliefs and ideas, and if every offensive material were taken off the shelf there would be no more materials in the library, so it is up to the individual person to decide what to read.      People have different ideas of offensive material. A @CAPS1 might find @CAPS2 books in the library offensive, and a @CAPS2 @MONTH1 find @CAPS1 texts in the library offensive. Yet neither of these materials are in and of themselves bad. The individual person might not like them, so they should decide not to read, listen to, or watch the materials. People also have different ideas of good reading material.     The genres of books are wide spread and very diverse. Science fiction to autobiography are all available in the library. An individual @MONTH1 find a vampire book offensive because of their idea that vampires are evil; and another might enjoy these books because they like to use their imagination. In my own experience, vampire and fantasy books are not offensive, because people know that they are fiction, as are all the creatures in them. These kinds of books are purely for imagination. If a person finds them offensive then they should not read them. It is up to the integrity of people if they should read material or not. If an individual finds a material and in the middle of reading, listening to, or watching it, then it is up to them to choose not to read it. Other people @MONTH1 not find it offensive. These are situations that you can not please everyone in. The individual has to decide what is best.     It is not the decision of the people that a book should not be in a library because it is offensive. However, in my observation, if the cover of the material is inappropriate then the jacket should be covered or changed, because of little children that @MONTH1 see it. Yet they should remain on the shelves as long as they are not adult material. It is also up to the parents to monitor what their children and teens are reading.     Therefore, material should not be removed from library shelves because it is found offensive. If an individual finds a material offensive then they should avoid it, but taking the material from other people is not right. As long as the covers are appropriate for children, who wander by, to see, they should remain on the shelf. It is the individuals choice to read or not to read, not someone elses decision to take it off the shelf"	6894	6895
4937	2	"I believe noone should really have the right to take any books, music, movies, magazines etc. off the shelfs. However, not even if one person or even more than one person thinks they aren't appropriate or whatever the cause might be. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, maybe one person @MONTH1 not like one book but another person does. Or maybe perhaps one person might like this certain type of music and one might not. You shouldn't just take things off the shelf because there is one that @MONTH1 not like one thing or @MONTH1 diagree with something that is in the book or music or anything. It's called difference.      Also there is culture. There is also beliefs. Many people are different and like different things. A person @MONTH1 find something offensive but if they do maybe they should just find something else and put back whatever that they might find offensive or wrong. The point i am trying to get at is that all people are different we all don't like the same things or dislike the same things. We all find different things interesting or not so interseting or wrong, and even right, maybe great or not so great as well.      We are all different. Don't mean to repeat the same things over and over again but its true we are all different. It is a true fact. I dont know, some people @MONTH1 disagree with my outlook on things about books, music, movies, magazines ect. being removed from shelves. Although, just because one person @MONTH1 think there's something in the book, magazine, newspaper, movie, or music, that @MONTH1 be wrong and shouldn't be in there.       I will agree, that I have disagreed on some things that I have seen myself in movies or read in books and magazines. But that doesn't give me the right to just stop it and keep it from being out there for everyone else that @MONTH1 like it or enjoy it. Therefore everyone has there differences. Kind of like debating on things. Some will agree with this and some @MONTH1 not. We all are able to have our own oppinions on things around us.      All people see things different or @MONTH1 even take things different. Just keep in mind that it is best to keep your thoughts to yourself. If you don't like something don't stop it or take it away fom people who @MONTH1 like it. Well i would have to say that is my perspective on all of this. I hope I've said enough"	6896	6897
4938	2	"I am writing this article to you @DATE1, because I feel a sense of pride in our libraries these days. I do not believe that our libraries should have unwanted items of impurities on it's shelves for all to see. I do believe however that they should be stripped of all harmfull veiwing content.     Some of the things that could be harmfull to be on the shelves at libraries would have to be, movies, magazines, books, and music. Im not talking about just things of that nature that are not appropriate for children to be veiwing, but I am also talking about certain beleifs and oponions that are shared in books and in movies. More specificly speaking, books that exprees its ideas about evolution. Those types of books and movies can put the wrong idea into peoples minds.     I remember one time when I went to the library to get a book about dinosours, and that book ended up being about evolution. I took that straight back to the library because I did'nt want anythin to do with it. After I found out that libraries had books and movies and magazines on the topic of evolution, I took a oath to do my very best to rid the them of all the awful content about evolution.     I just really feel a sense of saddness in my haert when I see young people go into libraries and be around all the harmfull knowledge of evolution talk. All the libraries should rid them selves clean of all the movies, magazines, music, and books that have anything to do with evolution or any other bad ideas and theriors. So I right this article to pleed my part of all this. I beg you to look for a way to see things right."	6898	6899
4939	2	"What would happen if all the books that people thought were offinsive were removed off of the shelves? In this essay I am going to give my own opinion about certin books or materials being removed from the shelve, because of offensive wording written in them.      Books grant us with knoledge, and excitment. What one person @MONTH1 love another would hate. If all the books that people thought were offensive, were taken off the shelves, we would have no books left.      The '@CAPS1' word twards black people is offensive, so if they were to take offensive books away, then goes huck finn, or any other books written back when slavery was an issue.Some people dont like our school books. they treat them bad and destroy them. if they really wanted to the could just say something was offensive in them, and have them removed from schools, just because, they don't like them. People think the littlest things are offensive, when there not.      In my full opinion the books some people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. I believe they should just get over it and go on with there lives, because what are we without books? A bunch of brainless monkeys trying to work a @CAPS2.     Should people be able to take books off the shelves if they find them offensive? The answer is no, because without books we couldn't have formed the world we live in today. People need to learn to love books for the good they have done us, not for the offensive things in them."	6900	6901
4940	2	"Hello, my name is @PERSON1 and im a student at @ORGANIZATION1. I think that books should be aloud to have what ever they want in them because everybody has their own openion and their own perspective on things. If kids cant learn about these things in school where they are tought not to do these bad things, then where can they learn them? I say more than likley on the streets, and if kids are learning on the streets then they are more than likely doing it because their isnt an adult figure their to make them understand that its bad and other kids are going to try to influce them.      I think music should be cencored in school because a lot of kids parents dont let them listen to cuss  in music, but if they can get it at school then whats the difference? Music doesent have a ratings like movies to tell you what the content is so kids will just listen to what ever they want and parents dont do a lot about it because they dont know what the music has in it. Take my mom for examle, she listens to country and she hates rap, but i listen to rap. She lets me listen to it because she has never listened to anything i like so therefor she doesent have a clue what profanity is in it and therefor she doesent stop me from listening to it.      My openion on movies would have to be to cencor them but to an extent. If its for educational purposes then i dont think it should be cencored, but if its just a movie day and somebody wants to bring in a movie with profanity and nudity, i dont thank that should be aloud because some people take it to far and also some kids parent dont want them learning about those things just yet.      Magazines are about the same as movies and music, it should be cencored, because if not kids would bring things like porn and other non-appropriate magazines to school and would be showing other kids. Once again this leads back to parents not wanting their kids to be involved in those type of activities."	6902	6903
4941	2	"Ban books, a topic many schools and libraries contimplate and debate about.  Why would you ban books in the first place though?  What can words on a page do to change your mind about something if it is that important to you?  Reading books is a choice, and it is your choice what you do with the knowlege you gain after you close its pages.      Some books are not suited for young readers and I agree with that I do.  However it is also a choice parents should keep monitor over.  It is not the school or libraries responsibility to look over what your child reads.  You don't have to ban books to keep them out of reach of little hands.  The library has a childrens section, and at elementary schools they don't have inaproprit books kids can get ahold of.  But it is still your right as a parent if you don't feel a book is fit for your child you can always make the decision for them not to read it.     I disagree with the decision of any book being ban.  Especially at high schools, by the time you reach this age you should be able to be mature about the materials you check out.  I don't believe any book could be so bad as to say no one should ever read this book.  In high school you  usually have very little free time anyway, I feel if you want to spend that time reading it should be able to be any book you like.  Why should adults who are not your parents get to decide what you fill your mind with anyway?  Granted not all parents monitor their children's reading choices to carefully but again that is a  reflection on them as a parent not the school's or librarie's.       When your a kid the one thing you want to do when your parents tell you not to so something is do it as many times as you can without getting caught.  If a book is so bad your school even says no you cannot read this book kids are going to want to read it.  They're going to be curious that's human nature.  If you give kids the freedom to choose their books maybe there would be more knowlage gained, but if your putting a restriction on it it just makes everything more difficult.  When you have to read certain books if your not interested in them how are you going to stick with it?  Well your probably not, and if those are the only books your able to check out then your ambition for reading is not going to stay for very long.  You could be missing out on some great books and not even realize you enjoy reading because you were never given a chance to read a really great book.     I am not saying the book all about sex and drugs and violence when your eight years old.  But simple books such as @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, that book is ban because some parent in  @LOCATION2 said she didn't want her child to read it because there are talking animals in it.  When I was a kid I thought animals talked anyway thats not a big deal ,but for some other schools she got this story ban.  Also the classic @ORGANIZATION1 is ban this one because it has a pig in it and  they say it is ofensive to @CAPS2.  If that one mom would of just told her kid no you cannot read this book other children wouldn't have to miss out on the chances to read such great and inspiring stories such as these.       I have mentioned many thoughts on this topic.  No I don't feel books should be removed from any shelf inless you are pulling them down to dust them off and share the contents with a friend.  No book could be that offensive, if you find it offensive all you have to do is place it back on the shelf and go  on with your day.  Reading books is a choice, and it is your choice what you do with the knowlage you gain after you close its pages."	6904	6905
4942	2	"Censorship should be taken seriously the conciquences can affect our youth. When a child is in a library they want to look around and explore, but when the libraries have subjects on drugs, alcohol, teen pregnacy and abortion they are fueling the curiousity of a young childs mind. With the way the media and authors of books are these days you see more vercitile writing than in previous years. People are more open to talking about sex, drugs and teen pregnancy because its an every day occurance to many.      When a elementary or high school student goes into a library and can pick up a book about drugs, alcohol, teen pregnancy and sex that is very inappropreate. I have walked into my own library at my school and have read books about drugs, sex, gay marriage  and many other disterbing topics. Also at my school middle schoolers, twelve and thirteen year olds, can pick up these same books. Books like these should not be sitting on the shelf for young high school students to read. It seems like the young gergeneration are learning more and more at a younger age, things children should not know. It is wrong that a high school library can help that out and provide books on these offensive topics.      The books at our library are filled with things that some kids @MONTH1 find offensive or to much to hear, but what about the parents? The parents of the children should be asking the school board or librarians what they are allowing their child to pick up and read on a day to day basis. Parents should be going to their local library to see for themselves what their children have all day access to, if they knew they wouldn't like it. Parents need to make sure that their childs school is safe. Having material like gay marriage, teenage sex, drugs, alcohol and other things is not safe for the child. It is introducing them to topics they should not find out about until they are much older. Some topics that are talked about in gossip magazienes and books have very strong opinions, that means someone elses opinion on these sensitive topics are being brought to your childs attention. Parents should be able to trust their local library to keep your child safe and away from these topics, but now parents have to worry what their child picks up from the library. The libraries should not limit the kids on what they don't have access to, but what they do have access to.      Movies in the library are also very contrevercial. I have looked at some movies in the library and wondered if that should really be on the shelf. There are movies that have drugs, alcohol use, sexual scenes, and gay material. The movies also have the ratings such as @CAPS1, @NUM1, or @CAPS2, but in the library a middle schooler can pick out a movie no matter what the rating is and take it home. The parent would have no idea what their child is watching. Parents should be able to trust the librarians to follow the ratings and to be smart. Another thing a child has access to in the library is magazienes. Magazienes are a good sorce of news, current events, politics and much more. Some magazienes are good but some are gossip magazienes that have very high views on certain topics.  I have a subscription to the magaziene @CAPS3. This magaziene has many topics that I would never want to show my little sister. The magaziene has gossip articles, current event artices, then the 'sensitive' aritcles about things like gang rapes, drug abbuse, alcohol addiction, bullying, sex, and @ORGANIZATION1's. These are not things that young girls, or boys should have access to. Libraries have these types of magazienes on the shelf and they allow anyone who wants to check them out to do that.      Our childrens libraries should be a safe learning enviroment, but they shouldn't be learning about certian topics. Library censorship should be taken in to account, the kid affected are our nations future. This is a very serious issue that could be happening in the best schools in the best places. The kids being affected by this could be your own. Are you going to change it"	6906	6907
4943	2	"Hi, yes  im  writing  a  paper  to  the  public  libraries.  I  do  believe  that  cartain  materials  should  be  removed  from  the shelves  if  there  are  found  offensive.  I  won't  to  support  my answer  by  saying  this  some  people  might  think  that  its offensive  on  what  getting  took  of  the  shelves.  But  others dont  think  so  the  libraries  is  hat  you  wont  to  take  of  off and look at if you dont like it put back somebody else might wont  to  look  at  that  book  or  movie  etc.  Now  on  that other  hand  people  wont  to  look  at  the  book  or  movies  etc can  do  so  they  might  be  writing  a  paper  they  can  go  find the  book  and  it  would  be  there.     For  an  example  when  I  wont  to  go  to  the  librarie  I  go look  up  a  book  that  I  wont  to  read  or  an  magazin,  movie I  won't  to  watch.  I  dont  think  the  stuff  they  have  in  the libraries  are  not  offensive.  Somebody  might  wont  to  write  a  story  base  on  the  movie  that  they  have  or  a  book.  If they  take  it  off  the  shelves  that  person  can't  do  no  resacrh  on  that  topic  they  won't  to  do.  Some  people  go  to libraries  just  to  find  music  and  if  they  take  that  off  the shelves  they  not  coming  back.     For  some  movies  that  have  bad  stuff  you  should  be over  the  age  @NUM1.  Know  one  under  that  age  should  be able  to  watch  it  or  check  it  out. Books  should  be  for everybody  I  don't  think  some  books  have  anything  bad  in  it  maybe  a  few  cuss  words  that's  it  and  thanks  for  taking  the  time  to  read  this  I  hope  you  understand  what  im  talking  about"	6908	6909
4944	2	"If someone or something told you their opinion about you would you get offended or would you just act like it never happen? Katherine Paterson an author has a quote that states: 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     I strongly disagree with having censorship in libraries because as said in the quote stated above to my understanding: If everyone could take a book or some kind of material off the self of the library that they didn't want their child reading or just because they didnt like what consisted of. There would be no books left.     If I were a parent and I didn't want my children reading things that I knew were going to make them upset or effect them. I would most deffinetly not let them even get close to the material in the first place. I would be right by their side untill they got old enough to make their own desicions so that nothing would ever happen to them.     Say I went to the library and I found a magazine that was over losing weight. While looking at that article I noticed that there was a body mass index chart to the left in the margin. I start looking at it and figuring out my b.m.i. and its basically saying I was over weight. @CAPS1 not going to go sit down and cry about it and say this magazine I looked out told me I was over weight so @CAPS1 not going to eat anymore and throw it away. I would just be like thats not true at all and I think that things like this would most deffinetly not happen if I had someone right by my side telling me thats not true.     What I have found out as a teen over the years is that everything you hear, say, or read is not always true and you should not take it to heart. You know who you are and what your all about, so dont let anyone or anything tell you different. After that day I started to make sure I either avoided situations like that or had someone with me.      My advice to one that reads this is just dont let it get to you be careful with what you look at and if your young and are at the library have a adult with you so nothing ever will happen to you like it did to me."	6910	6911
4945	2	"Books enable the mind to go to work and allows the readers to use their imagination. But if books are taken away from these readers, how, then, can their minds be stretched and molded? How can they be introduced to new ideas and look beyond what is fact or fiction? The censorship of books denies the complete freedom of readers of all ages and prevents them from expanding and broadening their minds to new subjects and ideas. Literature is about expessing yourself and the censorship of books does not allow authors or readers to have that freedom.          As young children we read stories that have nice, happy endings and they always seem to have a moral to it. The world seems to be safe and life is easy. But as we begin to grow up, the challenges of life also grow and our choice of books and other reading material begin to expand. It is all a part of growing up. The books of our youth allowed us to use our imagination and the books of our later years allowed us to learn about and cope with reality. If our books were removed because they were found offensive, then how would we be able to see reality as reality? Censored reading materials prevent the world from learning about new things. You wouldn't take away health books in a health class because it goes into explicit detail about the facts of life. It is the right and choice of readers to learn about these things, not anyone elses. If a book is too offensivefor them, then they can choose to stop reading it. One book @MONTH1 not be the right book for one person, but it @MONTH1 be the right one for another person.          How does a person or group decide which books to take off the shelves? How can one book be more explicit than another? My sister is a fourth grader and she is reading the book '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 the past few days she has become very angry at the fact that they author uses explicit words. '@CAPS3 does the author use cuss words?' she asked me one day. '@CAPS4't he know that fourth graders are reading this?' I remember thinking the same way she did when I was her age, but then I realized that, as I grew up, the words that were said were only a part of life and will always be. If this book was taken off the shelf for fourth graders, then what books should be taken off for teenagers my age. I read 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6' a few months ago and the choice of words in this short novel was not very pleasent. I do admit I was a bit put off by many of these words, but it was a part of history. It is how they talked and acted back them. 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6' is a classic and the thought of taking it off the shelves would cause much contreversy. But if this book isn't censored, @CAPS3 are others? All books teach a valuable lesson whether it is wrong or right. 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6', no matter how much I disliked the language that was used, put me into that time in history and I was able to understand the feelings and the events of this book much better than if these words wouldn't have been used.      Literature is about expressing and freeing yourself. Literature gives you freedom, and choices. You have the choice to read fairytale stories to escape reality or you can read a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine if facts and nature interests you. Censoring books takes away some of this freedom for readers. Do you remember the little childrens toy that had a box with holes and you had blocks that were shaped to fit the holes? As a child, you learn which shape goes with which hole and as you grow even older, you learn what shapes these blocks and holes are. Well, taking away certain books is like taking away one of those blocks away from a child. If the child is not given that shape, it is not given the opportunity to learn that that shape goes in its designated hole. If a reader is not given the freedom of choice, then they will miss the opportunities to broaden their minds and learn about new ideas. How can a reader know if they like a certain genre of book, if only but one genre is presented to them?     Censoring books prevents readers from expanding their knowledge and they lose the ability to express themselves in a certain way. Censorship of books could start a process like that of a domino effect. If one book can be censored for one thing, then other books could fall into that same category. If there are no books left, then how can a person learn"	6912	6913
4946	2	"In today's society, many things that were once considered inappropriate are now commonplace.  This, however, does not mean that some material is meant for or okay for children to see.  There are many books, magazines, and movies in libraries that are inappropriate for children to be observing.  Libraries should establish a common system and common boundaries on what should be censored for the sake of the children that are in attendence at the library.  Since most parents have a similar opinion on what is considered right and wrong for children to observe, coming up with common rules should not be a very hard task.     With today's declining concept of what is appropriate and what is not, @CAPS3 is hard to protect children from early exposure to inappropriate things.  However, some measures can be taken to help keep children's minds as innocent as possible.  One of the possible ideas to help this situation is by censoring some of the literary works in libraries.  Since many parents and adults agree on what is appropriate for children, coming up with a system of rules on censorship should not be as difficult as @CAPS3 @MONTH1 seem.  For example, there could be a room with books that contain adult material located separately from where children are aloud.  This could solve this issue by not exposing children to the media in the room where the adult content books were located, but the adult books could still be there for people of the appropriate age to enjoy.     Most parents in today's society have a common view and opinion on what is appropriate for their @CAPS1 to be exposed to.  Most parents do not want their @CAPS1 viewing books, movies, or magazines that contain sexual material or vulgar language.  Adding censorship to some of the material in libraries could keep children from viewing this type of media as much as they would if there were not censorship laws.  However since there are some parents' opinions that do not coincide with the opinions of other parents, the board members of the library or the librarians themselves should decide on a commom set of rules and regulations on what is appropriate and what is not.  In the extreme case, states could create and establish their own laws about this issue.     As a @CAPS1, I brought home the book 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3', in  fourth grade, and was shocked to find that there was very vulgar language at a couple points in the story.  After my mom discovered what i was reading and the material in @CAPS3, she took @CAPS3 to the school library and showed them what I had found.  The librarians apologized numerous times, and had a restriction established that only sixth grade and up could read the book.  This is one example of a form of censorship in our school library.     Although many people would say that censoring books and other media from libraries is essential, others disagree with this.  Some people would go on to say that everyone has different opinions on what is right and what is wrong.  As the author of this article states, she feels that if people were to censor books and other media based on their own opinion of what is right and what is wrong, in the end, there would not be any books left on the shelves.  With every person and parent having their own unique opinion, the author feels that all books would be eliminated if libraries were to censor media based on each individual opinion.     While there are two sides to this arguement, I believe that libraries should censor their media to a certain extent.  The state should establish a set of censorship laws that abide to all libraries in that specific state.  This would eliviate some of the pressure off of the librarians to try and please all of the people in attendance.  This way, children could be exempt from media that the state law says is inappropriate.  Children's minds could remain as innocent as possible, and they could remain unexposed to material too adult-friendly for their age."	6914	6915
4947	2	"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 is offensive to you? Bad language, religious views, parenting advise, certain styles of clothing? @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to some people might not be offensive to others. Just because one person thinks something is offensive, should take it off the shelf?     I do not believe that certain reading materials, movies or music should be removed from libraries, book stores or anywhere else just because some people think that something  is 'offensive' about a book, magazine, music or movie. A christian might read the bible and enjoy reading the bible, an athiest might pick up the bible to read it and think it is offensive to them because of the different religious views. Instead of removing the bible from the library, why not put it in a special section called religion and in the religion section have the different religion books. The bible would go under christian. That way a person who is not a christian will not pick it up, read it and find it offensive and try to get it out of the library or book store.     A lot of parents do not want their child listening to music, watching movies and reading books with foul language in it. Some parents do not mind the language and let their children listen to music, read books or watch movies with bad language in it. It all depends on the parent. It is not just kids that are not listening to foul language, it is adults as well. A lot of adults do not mind it when something has not so good language and some even use that language themselves. Would it be fair to take out items with foul language? No. Marking the books, music or movies would be a better idea, that way if an adult who is against foul language can see that there is bad language and they do not have to find out the hard way or have their kids read it. Movies that have language that @MONTH1 be offensive have a warning before the movie even starts, so it is not a suprise to people who do not like that. At the @ORGANIZATION1, I hear every bad word in the book all day for the seven hours I am there. Should the schools take out the students who use that kind of language, no, there would be hardly any students left in the @ORGANIZATION1. So think about it, should libraries do the same about reading materials, music and movies?      @CAPS1 even makes a book 'offensive'? Do you decide that, your neighbor, your close relative, the author of the book? Are we all the same? No, not even identical twins are the same or think the same. Now days it seems that everything is offensive. Because we are not the same as everybody else, we can not speak for everyone else by saying that some reading material is offensive. People need to realize that they can not get away from everything that is bad in this world. Should one religious book be terminated from a library just because someone else in the whole world does not believe the same way? Should a movie be taken out of the theater because it has foul language in it? @CAPS1 do you think? I think that if something is offensive to me, I will not read it, listen to it, or watch it. Why take it out, other generations could be missing out on a really good book. The other generations could be missing out on some inspiring music, or a touching movie. Has the saying 'never judge a book by its cover' crossed your mind, well the same could go for the inside of the book as well. So if a book, magazine, movie or music is offensive to you, do not buy it, listen to it, watch it, or read it. It is just that simple. Remember @CAPS1 might be offensive to you, might not be offensive to others"	6916	6917
4948	2	"Writing, music, and production. All three of those are a form of a certain art. Litterary art, musical art, and visual art. People make artwork for the world to see and hear. And when people begin to complain about the content of a certain artwork, it is censored.     I do not agree with removing books, movies, music, magazines, nor anything else from shelves if someone finds them offensive. Someone took the time out of their life and put together what they believed was a well thought out idea and created it. How did they get that book, movie, music, or magazine on a shelf? Someone else thought their idea of whatever kind of artwork is it was a good idea, meaning more than just them enjoy it.     I, myself, am a music artist. I write music and play it with my band. Alot of time, hard work, and all around dedication is taken to achieve but @NUM1 song fully written. So say my band and I take the time to put together an album of our music. That music would be sent in to a recod label. Now lets say the record label signs us. That label would find places to put that music on the shelves of certain stores so that a consumer could purchase that music. Ultimately, it is the consumer who judges what artwork they obtain.     What if the consumer was offended by the music the record label put out? Well here @MONTH1 be a better point. If the consumer was offended by the content of that art work, why did they purchase it? It isn't their right to buy artwork they are offended by just to complain about it to try and have it removed. This situation can be easily avoided if that consumer avoided that artwork.      Why should only a few people who complain have the time and hard work of others censored by the media? It's just not fair to the artist! Alot of dedication and time is in the creation process of their work. And for someone to obtain it, complain about it, and ultimately try to have it removed it just wrong and ridiculously unjust. There is NO excuse for why people do that. The easiest wasy to keep from being offended is staying clear of that which you do not like/ offends you."	6918	6919
4949	2	"Hi i'm a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and I would like to write you this letter conflicting on the story about 'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?'     I personally don'@CAPS2 think they should because there are no books that are offensive to me. Yes, they might be offensive to others and that would cause a problem with everything. I don'@CAPS2 really read that often so it doesn'@CAPS2 bother me as much as it might others.     I would just take a vote on rather they should or @CAPS1'@CAPS2. I'm sure if there's enough people that wanted them to be off the shelves at libraries and such, they would vote on it and maybe pass.      Now I do believe that books that are offensive @CAPS1'@CAPS2 be in the kid's section of books; but adults, I don'@CAPS2 see why they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 be, because most adults are older and hopefully mature enough to just ignore it and move on. That is just my point of view about censorship in libraries.     Also, i believe that uncensored movies or magazines @CAPS1'@CAPS2 be in libraries because they make adult stores for things like that"	6920	6921
4950	2	"Removed from the Shelf?          I believe certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Childern, teens, and adults all perfer different books, movies, and music. Artist, and writers should be aloud to proclam what is on their mind and what needs for get acrossed to other people. Libaries, and all stores should not remove these artist and writers feelings and thoughts from the shelves because one person thinks it is offensive.           As a child, they perfer the books with many pictures, and fun filled characters. It is not likely for a child to pick up a book that is not right for them to be looking at. All child do not understand what is bad and wrong for them. They just want to look at pictures and have their imagination go wild. Child also are not likely to sit down and watch a rated or bad movie. The child to going to pick out a @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 family, or other fun enjoyable movie.     As a teen, I understand boys and girls start to understand what is out there in the world and want to know what some things are. But, shouldn't that be allowed having the teen be aware what there is be learned. Yes, I agree some things should be kept away from teens. As a teen they should not go out and try things, or get in trouble from adults and their own parents for wrong choices because of a book, or magazine. Becoming a teenager is learning right from wrong. Books, movies, music, and magaizines is one of the easitst ways to get acrossed to teens.     Now for adults I understand they get more offensive for the items that are out there. They want the kids in the world to be brought up right and want them to do what is right. They do not want their child to be learning and understanding everything that is bad out there in the world. So therefore, adults take items more offensive and younger people do.     In conclusion, books, movies, music, and magaizines that are offesive should not be taken off the shelves, just so a selective few can be happy. Everyone has a differnt opion, and view on things out there in the world. People should respect one another for that and understand that what they think is not what another thinks"	6922	6923
4951	2	"Thier are somethings that I agree with and others I don't. I agree everyone is a little over protected of thier kids but thats why they have blocks and resrictions on adult rated and @CAPS1 rated movies, and music, etc. Thier are bunch of diffrent ways you can stop kids from watcing or reading something thier not supposed to. And i'@CAPS1 gonna name off a couple of ways.     One way to stop your kid or other kids from not watching what thier not supposed to is don't do anything like that around them. Another way is to check up on your kids if thier alone for a long period of time like, on a computer or reading. I think thier are many ways to stop your kids from looking at stuff like that you just have to keep an eye on them. Now i'@CAPS1 gonna support my position on why I don't think it's bad.     One of the reasons I don't think it's bad is that a lot of good action and horror movies are @CAPS2 rated and mature. And so are a lot of good books like @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and many more. And another reason is, if they took all the stuff away from everyone we wouldn't have anything left. Like, no movies, no books, no @CAPS3, etc. And that would make life boring and useless. My last paragraph is gonna be about life without movies, music, and books.      Life without books, movies, and music. I wonder what it would be like? I don't think I want to know cause I know I can't live without music, or movies. I think life would suck without any of these cause they make us laugh, they make us smile, etc. What i'@CAPS1 trying to get at is life would suck without any of these. Now i'@CAPS1 gonna restate my intro.        I really don't agree with  removing stuff from a public place. Because a lot of places have any adult only section. And I think thats how it should be. Because a lot of good movies,music,books, and magazines would be taken away from the people that are old enough to watch them or read them. You cant just get rid of all the good stuff or nothing would be left. And people wouldn't be happy. thats my opionion"	6924	6925
4952	2	"I don't think it would be right to take them off the self. I think you should put and age that you would haft to be to bye the books,movies,etc. If there to bad maybe put them in a back room or some where the kids that are not the right age cant to bye or look at them. there is other things you can do to keep kids that dont need to see offensive things away from the movies and books that is really eazy to get.there is alot of books, etc, that some peaple like and some dont like. So if everyone has the right to take the movies and books off the shelf there will not really be any book or movies left. There is some things that are offensive to some one and not to another. I think if you dont like it you sould just put it down and leave it alone its not are job to keep others kids from seeing or reading stuff like that i think it is the parents job to. i mean your not going to let you kids play in the street so why let them watch or read things that are not safe? There for I dont think its right to take them off the shelf where maybe i will like the movie just because it has some stuff that kids dont need to see or read.Some times the kids seeing movies about killing and stuff will make then not want to go do stuff that they was reading or watching. So some times its not a bad thing for thim to see that stuff because it might help them. but then some will think its cool and try it every one thinks diffrent so we really cant stop kids or peaple that think the rong way bye taking thing away from them. I think they sould make books, movies, and etc, censored. Maybe make the same book or movie and take the stuff thats bad out for the kids so they can still see the movie but just the bad parts are not in the movie or book. Some varry good movies or book have bad things that not every one needs to see so it might help to make the movies with that not in them"	6926	6927
4953	2	"Yes, I think that some of the materials should be removed from the libraries. I think that the libraries should have more stricter computer rules.      A couple of months ago my mother and I had to go to the library to use the computer. We had to go to a library because I had a project to do, and we were having problems with our printer at home. While at the library we located the computer lab. When we walked in all the computers were taking by teenagers. We had asked the man who was in charge of the lab how long do you think the lab would be full and he just sat back in his computer chair like he could not hear me or something. They were on all @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, playing games, or listening to loud music. I don't think that you should go to the library all day just so you can sit and use the computer. They were not doing anything constructive or educational. That's why I agree on having some library materials removed because some people take advantage of them. I really needed to print some things out on the computer but we had to sit and wait for about one hour and twenty minutes.     When we finally got a chance to use the computer, it was almost closing time. My mother was very upset and so was I. It just doesn't seem fair to people who use the library correctly to have to wait forever just to use the computer. As long as I live I will never forget that day. I thought that a library was supposed to be a place where people who like to read, study, and research go. Not a place where society has taking over to sit around all day to use and abuse the computer lab just because they don't have a computers at home. I think it's just a shame the way things are now. That's why I hope that things change"	6928	6929
4954	2	"Do you ever have that feeling when your child comes home and talks about this book they're reading, about drugs, sex, and alcohol? Maybe music, movies, or even magazines to. The feeling that they probly should not be reading that book. Maybe the library should think about it to, or the school cooperation. Some books just arent mean't for kids a certaint age to read. Yes, teens are going to be teens and read about that kind of stuff, but there should be limits on what age groups can read what books, music, movies, and magazines.      Im here to say that some of the books and magazines can be offensive to read. They talk about teens having sex and getting pregnant at times, and even hooked on drugs. Reading books is great, yes, but there are some books you should be a certaint age to read about all that kind of stuff. A book has an impact on teens, they read it and some of them get so caught up into that book on drugs or sex, they think that they can do it to. That woulf be a bad choice on there part though.     Magazines? Who would have thought that librarys now have magazines. Most librarys have a good selection of them to. Are they all suitable for kids in school to check out and read is the question. Alot of them are fun and great to look at, except one thing, some talk about sex. Some magazines talk about being addicted to drugs, being in a gang, or violence group. I think that when the kids read these kinds of things, since they see real people do they also think its ok to do it to. magazines have an impact on children to!     We all watch movies, dont we? I know alot of teens like to watch movies with friends and family. Why not go to the library and see the kind of movies you can check out. Teens go to the library alot. They go for music, books, magazines, and movies. You would think that since its a library, movies couldnt be to bad. My friend @PERSON1 and I had went to the library to check out a movie for movie night one day, and there were kids eight and nine, checking out @NUM1 movies. Now i know that certaint ages can watch certaint movies, but there has got to be limits in the librarys!      I love listening to music. It is one of my favorite things to do, at night, in the @TIME1, and whenever i get the chance to listen to it. I go to the library and check out music alot. They have a big variety, rap, rock, country, and even some with very foul language. Librarys need to understand, not everyone should be able to check out music with that kind of language. Its ok at a certaint age group, but some kids shouldnt be listening to it, and they should set an age limit on what yu can listen to and what age you have to be to check some of there stuff out.     Librarys should think more about there consumers, than other things. They should set boundries, and take off the shelf the books, magazines, movies, and music that kids at a certaint age group should not be looking at. There will always be books on there shelves, just not everyone will be able to look at some of them. There will always be music to listen to, movies to watch, and magazines to fantasize over, just not till your the right age to do it"	6930	6931
4955	2	"I believe that  certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves they are on if they are found offensive. Even the quote of Katherine Paterson says if we keep removing books off of shelves there will be no books left for our children to get off the shelves. I am not saying you should agree with her, but I find her quote true.     Imagine, your in the year @NUM1, the @ORGANIZATION1 is a new country. The founding fathers only wrote the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 of the @LOCATION1 in the past couple of decades. You breeze through the @ORGANIZATION2. You read one single right that @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS4 of the @CAPS5. You get the idea to publish something. You relize you have been angry about the last few political elections. You publish a book on why you do not agree with the new major of your town. Your novel gets set into the public library, but soon gets taken out. How would you feel? Other people have books in the library why cant you? Opinion is not right or wrong. It is what you think. People cannot place the title on your work, and say it is wrong. It is an opinion, people do not have to agree.     Yes, as a young child I can remember picking up a few books in the public library my mother would have not been happy if she knew I saw them. But that should not be a reason to rip books off of their shelves and toss them away. If parents are extremely conserned on what their children see while at the library, then at most librarys should seperate their books into an adult section and into a children section.      One of my greatest pet peeves is when someone complains about an article they read being wrong or right. Sometimes I tell people 'The writer does what he/she wants.' I believe this is true. The @CAPS4 of the @CAPS5 people can write about what they want either offensive or not.     The thought of people tearing books out of shelves disgusts me. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed off of their shelves. It is against the @CAPS3, and is just plain wrong"	6932	6933
4956	2	"I think that they should remove certain materials that are offensive to someone. One thing I do not like about this subject is that when students and parents complain about the book they are reading,what can we do about. Nothing!There are so many arguments that could be reason why you should take them off the shelfs.  I am going to tell you three reason why I should be removed.  The three reasons are that they are nasty things things to see, how it effects us, and why certain material contain language.     The first reason is they contain nasty material on the cover of magazines, movies with disguiting parts, and books describing a romance of thier love and them.  I think that these children are not thinking that this is bad, but in reality it is.  Also they do not need to learn dirty things that are bad for them, because the parents wonder what they are learning. I think that what they learn, the first reaction is @CAPS1. I was in the mall one day and saw a child that was just staring a girl with just a bikni on. He told his mom and she was not happy about that. That bring me to the second reason.     I believe that the materials that contain the language is not a good thing for the young children.They want these children to see these violent movies that have bad words that should not be said by them. Another thing is that they should not read, watch, or hear things that should not be said.  One thing that is bad is rapp and rock-roll music because of the language the songs have in it.The experience I have seen is with dillon, because he always says cuss words and that is not right.  One time he was standing infront of me when he said it. I told him not to say that word again. After this reason, I get to the final reason why it needs to be removed.     I believe that it will effect our whole life because of the actions we do.  We all need to relieaze that the bad things are what gets us into trouble in the first place.  I think that our generation is horrible right now because of the language that everyone is saying.  Also that the actions that people do are just not right.  When these books try to actually want to tell the kids about what happened when they become violent, they are not even helping the kids. I have another person who is like this and his name is codi.  I saw him one day with his friends acting out and doing bad this.  I told him that I did not agree with it.  Then he told me to leave him alone.  I did and left. I think that the children should know what the good actions are not the bad ones.   I have always thought that they contain nasty materials, contain language that should not be said, and how it effects some peoples life.  I think that we should stand up for what is wrong and right.  This movies, I think, are showing what is wrong and can be right sometimes.  Also I think the language in the movies are not good for little kids.  I believe that we could change the world if we just take out the materials that are in our libraries, that conatins things that little children should not see or hear at all.  The final thing I have to say is that we could change children's life if we just give them things thtat are healthy to learn and to understand with the books that actually better for them to read instead"	6934	6935
4957	2	"I would like to tell you my view on censorship in libaries. Katherine made a good point saying that there is books we wish children never took of the book shelf, but isn't better to have them read a book that they like and not have people telling them that they can't read it. No!! No child likes to be told you can't look at that or you can't read that because I don't think that its a good influence on you. Look at it this way.. Isn't it better to have them reading a book with bad things in it then being out in the world doing it themselves? Yes it's better because you can see what that person had went through when they did that so you know you don't want that to happen to you. Don't take books from kids. Sometimes that is the only way children even get an education. Why take that from them? Thank you for your time."	6936	6937
4958	2	"In many libraries across @LOCATION1 there are sections that contain material that is inappropriot for children to read. This could include offensive language, violence or something sexually explicit. I believe that these things should be removed from public libraries where children can find them. Not only should these books be removed, but also any music, movie, or magazine containing these materials.     In the world we live in today many people use offensive language. This language often carries over to books that we read. Many older people have become numb to the effects of it on themselves but would still agree that it is not good for a child in elementary school to be reading. I do not think that any book that swears once or twice should be taken off the shelf, but when the book begins swearing on every page that is a problem. Many @CAPS1 at a library might contain songs with offensive language as well. If a child hears it over and over again, then they might begin to repeat what they hear.     Another thing that occurs in many teen and adult books is violence. For what reason would a child want to be reading about one person killing another person? There is simply no reason at all. Violence in a book would have less of an affect on a child than seeing it in a movie, however. That is why the librarians should always make sure the person renting a movie is old enough to watch it. If a young child tries to rent an @CAPS2 rated movie the librarian should make that young child put it back.      One final thing that should be censored out of library books is anything too sexual for a child to be reading. If there is something in that book that you wouldn't want to talk about with your grandma, then it shouldn't be in the library where children can find it. I don't think that any one would want a young child coming up to them and asking, 'whats that mean'. That is one situation that I personally would want to avoid.      So if you have a child and want them to remain innocent to offensive language, violence, and sexual content then you should want those books off the shelves. If too many people put up a fight about it then at least get them put on the top rows so the children can't reach them. Children do not need to be exposed to those things from the books of public libraries"	6938	6939
4959	2	"When someone finds a book, music, magazine, movie, or anything in this category offensive, should it be removed and/or thrown away out of that library/store? People @MONTH1 think that it should or not, but in my opinion, I honestly do not think that these materials should not be thrown out of that area.     The reason that I say no to this, is because everyone has their own opinion. Such as things having offensive words/visuals in a book, movie, music, etc. that talks about racist stuff against @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or any other race, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but there is a reason that somebody wrote it and there's a reason that it is there for. Everyone likes different types of things to watch, listen to, read about, and even to do. For example, I like to play sports, watch sports channels/games, be active, listen to rap and some country, read types of adventure books, and read sports magazines. Others @MONTH1 fine this stuff boring or dumb, I find it fun and enjoyable.     I am not a racist person, but a friendly and kind person to other religions, and skin color. Other people in this world like the @CAPS3.@CAPS3.@CAPS3. are racist and do not like colored people at all. Let's say that a @CAPS1 @CAPS5 walks into a library or store that has books or magazines and talks about the @CAPS3.@CAPS3.@CAPS3., and says they hate black people/nigers, and they should all die or something, the @CAPS1 @CAPS5 man will most likely find that very offenzive. Does this mean that this book or magazine should be thrown away or taken out from this area? I think no because there are things that people like that other people @MONTH1 not like.     From my own experience, I have found things very offensive in some things, but I do not want them thrown out of the store or library just because it has something I do not like, it is there because people like that kind of stuff and like to learn about it evern though I don't like it.     Another example of me not liking something would be, atheist and non-@CAPS9. Even though the fact people right books or talk stupid stuff about how @CAPS10 isn't real or something, doesn't mean it should be taken out. I @MONTH1 find this stuff offensive but it doesn't give any right to take it out.     In saying all of this, I do not think that it is right just for someone to not like something they see/read, that it should just be taken out just because that some people just dont like it. The quote stated by, @ORGANIZATION1 saying, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have takes off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' The reason that this Author had written this quote, is to simply state a fact that if everyone had the same right as everyone else to simply take one of the books that they disreguard the most, that we would have no book what so ever left on this earth stated at the end of his quote, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"	6940	6941
4960	2	"Censorship, according to @PERSON2's @CAPS1, is defined as 'the removel or substitution of certain words, phrases, or scenes.' In many movies, they sell the movie that is seen in theaters, but then you can see the 'unrated' version. The reason it is censored is because many people think that a specific word, phrase, or scene in it is considered inappropriate and do not want to see it. But movies are not the topic here, we are talking about books, which creates a whole new idea.     '@ORGANIZATION1' is known widely by people all over the world. It is an @CAPS2 classic, and is read by the majority of high schools in the @LOCATION1. Now, parents and teachers are wanting to dispose and censor this work of literary art because of a single word, nigger. Many people cringe at this word, they hear it and their eyes widen. It was a common word used to describe a black man during the @DATE1. Now considered a racist term, society has looked down upon the word, and has proclaimed it as profanity or a 'swear' word. But how is it used @DATE2?     If you go into downtown @LOCATION2, and travel around keeping an ear out to all sorts of conversation, many interesting topics will come up, as well as slang words used to refer to one another. You will hear 'homie,' 'brotha,' 'my boy,' and many others, and one most commonly used, 'nigger.' @CAPS3 not pronounced correctly (pronunciation is 'nigga'), nigger is a term now used by many black people as a friendly reference to a close friend of yours. From what started out as a racist and belittling term, has evolved into a casual way of calling someone your friend.     So if nigger is a nice thing to say, why censor? Because of the context in which it is used. The black men are not friends of the white man, they are slaves. Nigger was just another way of putting @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in their place as the lowest class in society at that time. So now that we are getting technical in the context in which it is used, we should censor it in the form that it is used in the book, right?      '@ORGANIZATION1' is a piece of @CAPS2 art. It is known internationally, and written by one of the most famous author of all time. In @DATE3, more copies of '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' were sold than the @CAPS7! And now, parents and teachers want to 'rewrite' it. That would completely ruin the realistic viewpoints and story that is behind it. Life back then was very different from @DATE2, so how are we supposed to understand @CAPS9, if the world keeps censoring it? We can't! There are certain things in this world that we cannot change, no matter how hard we want to. Everyone looks back on slavery and realizes what a terrible thing it was to do to all those @CAPS8. But how are we supposed to understand the mindset of that time and what went on when people are removing very important details about it? '@CAPS9 is bound to repeat itself to those who do not care to remember it.' quoted by @PERSON1 himself. If we do not learn all that went on in that time, we are destined to repeat it.     The word nigger is very offensive to others, but we cannot change what it did. People must realize what has happened cannot be changed and we must move on, learning from our fathers before us. Censorship does no good for society but cover our eyes. We cannot succeed in life if we grow up seeing that the world is peaceful and people do not hate each other and all will be well. That's not how the world is, no matter how unfortunate it is, people will hate, and people will discriminate. So show us now what mistakes were made in @CAPS9. Show us now the outcomes of actions previously committed. Show us now how we can become better people and fix the future. Show us now, and do not hide @CAPS9 from our eyes."	6942	6943

4962	2	"Of course everyone was their own opinion on what should be seen by the complex human mind or not. But who really has a say in what we can and can't buy, have, or even just take a glance at. Who gives anyone the higher power of saying that?           If you didn't get it from the introduction i completely disagree with censorship in libraries. I mean really, if someone finds offense to anything lurking around the library that doesn't mean that they have to gaze at it all day. It doesn't mean they have to check it out either. I don't see a problem with something just laying on the shelf, waiting for someone to come along with an open mind and opinion to read it.      Who really gives the right to say that offensive thing need to be taken out of our lives? Let's see. No one. We all are set here as equals, we are all human beings going from one day to the next, living our lives as fully as possible. Until you get that one crazy person who wants to shelter us all from the evil things of the library. What is that person really sheltering us from, a bad book? Oh no, call the enforcments.      I mean if this person is really worried about it, then why don't they do something a little less mellodramatic. Like the books, movies, magazines, ect. that are too mature for the littler eyes, then put them in a location where kids can not be in reach of them. Maybe even have them to where you can not check them out unless you are carded. It is so simple the things you can do without being so closed minded and over dramatic.     Who honestly wants a better life for people by censoring libraries? It doesn't make a difference in my life that is for sure. So why put it in the way of your's"	6946	6947
4963	2	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,    '@CAPS1 ANY book,' rings the teachers voice from across the library.  A boy of about ten finds a book with an interesting cover and title.  He takes it to the check-out counter.  When he hands the book to the librarian she looks at it momentarily and than sets it behind the counter.  '@CAPS2 don't you go find a different book?'  'But @CAPS2,' asks the boy.  The librarian explains that she doesn't think he will 'like' the book.  Later, he heres the librarian talking to his teacher. He heres something about the book being challenged; and that it officially not allowed to be in the children's section of the library.  She mumbles something about censorship and that the school board wants it off the shelf immediately.  The boy doesn't understand.  What does it mean when a book is challenged?  What is censorship?     Censorship is the changing, removing, and or editing of material deemed innapropriate.  Often, things that are censored are language, sexual references and other graphic material.  Graphic can be in reference to gore but also to severe emotional trama.   Drug and alcohol use are also often edited.   Censorship doesn't just accure in books, it occurs in movies, music, magazine, as well as other media outlets.     Some @MONTH1 ask what the difference between banned and censored material is.  A banned item is something that has been outlawed.  During the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @PERSON1's novel @CAPS5 @CAPS6's @CAPS7 was banned in the @LOCATION1 because of how it depicted slave owners.  The @CAPS8 government didn't like the book and so it was outlawed.  Anyone caught with the book could be put to death or punished severly by law.  In order for material to be censoredm, it must first be challenged.  Challenged material is material that has been question for appropriateness and offensiveness.  If material is found to be inappropriate or offensive, then it can be censored.  @CAPS9 material is often reviewed and adjustments are often made on availability of the material.       Who makes the decision on the material?  @CAPS9 is probably the most debated aspect of censorship.  Often times parents are the ones to rise up against controversial material especially when it effects their children.  If the material is available through the school the parents will often go to the school board.  If it is through a  business or agency, people will often go to the government to have something done.  However, whos decision is it really?  What @MONTH1 be appropriate for someone, could be highly offensive to another.        It is a personal decision about what material to listen to, view, and read.  Only, each individual can make the decision for themselves.  If it is a child that could 'use' @CAPS9 material, than it is up to the parents to allow their children to 'use' it.  Not every child should be forbidden from 'using' the material.  Parents should prescreen the things that their child wants to listen to, read, and watch.  It is the parents responsibility, not the governments and not the school board's.     The author Katherine Paterson said it best, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have take off the shelf.  But, if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf ...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS9 is true, everyone has a difference in opinion of what is appropriate and innapropriate.  If people were to take away every material that they found to be offensive (in some way) then chances are there would not be any material left for people to enjoy.  What would the world look like, if there was no material for everyone to enjoy?  What would it look like?                                        Sincerely,                                             @ORGANIZATION1"	6948	6949
4964	2	"As author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Paterson brings up a valid point--there are innumerable books out there that have rallies against them. To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2? Inappropriate language and character racism. @CAPS6 in the @CAPS3? Again, inappropriate language and also, according to some, explicit sexual descriptions. How is it that two novels that are often required reading in high school--therefore deemed fit for teenagers--are being banned in some places?     To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @CAPS6 in the @CAPS3 are just two controversial books among many. Really, what book doesn't have someone who loves it and someone who hates it? The issue is not that there are opposing sides to the books--it's that some think that the opposing opinions themselves are problems. People have opinions on everything. Their favorite color, their favorite pizza topping. Does that mean that every other color or pizza topping has to be obliterated because one person dislikes them? Of course not!      The worst case scenario when someone reads a book that they find offensive is that the person is exposed to something he or she dislikes. My question is, why is this an issue? People run into things they dislike everyday--it would be abnormal not to. As a society, we have learned to deal with religious differences, cultural differences, and just differing opinions in general. In @CAPS8 @NUM1, books were taken away from society. Although it was an effort to prevent anyone from getting upset, the censoring totally backfired. No one was happy, and everyone was the same. Opinions are what distinct us from others, and ultimately what keeps society in check.   Putting up with things we disagree with--in novels, and outside of them--is just another thing that has to happen in order to keep a functional society. Although it seems like 'making everyone happy' by banning offensive books would work, @CAPS8 @NUM1 shows that ignorance is not bliss.In the @LOCATION1, the main focus is democracy and autonomy. If something as minute as an offensive book was banned, what would that say about the @LOCATION1's democracy? Paterson highlights this: '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Everyone has the right to love or hate a book, and that can't be taken away without stripping the a person of all their basic rights of choosing.     Books, movies, music and magazines should not be banned for their content. In my experience, reading a book that I didn't agree with did nothing but expand my knowledge of views other than my own. In @CAPS8 @NUM1, when books were taken away in an effort to make everyone happy, society crumbled without different opinions. Though it is far-fetched to think books would be taken away from current society, banning books is the same idea. People have a right to love or hate anything--but they do not have the right to prohibit others from loving or hating things"	6950	6951
4965	2	"Should certain contents be taken off the shelf at our libraries? No, if something is offencive then just do not read it, just leave it on the shelf and walk away from it. In this case i agree with Katherine Paterson.     Everyone has a right to read what they want even if some of us disagree with what it is saying. It is a freedom we have and we should not take that away from our citizens.      We are known for our freedom of speach, religion, and almost everything else that other countries do not have. So why take it away? If we take that freedom away we are just like every other country out there and that is one thing i do not aprove of. Okay, so little children should not read what teenagers or adults read because thats not what they have to deal with. All in all that is the parents job to stop them from reading those tpye of materials.      If  we observe what we read and everything today as teenagers you would find that some of us read the most horrible things in life. Case in point, war, suicide, murder, rape, and drug dealing, but yet parents expect us to listen to the news when thats where the most horrible things are. We hear about all of that in the news everyday wether it be murder, drug dealing, rape, war, or suicide, the news will show it all. In books its just a book but in the news it is reality. The worst thing a child or teenager can hear is what is going on in the world.       So, that being said we should not take anything off the shelf because we heaer worse things on the news then in books. Books are for entertainment unlike the news that is reality and true."	6952	6953
4966	2	"In @LOCATION1, does everyone really have their own voice? I disagree with certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., being  removed from libraries. Even if they are found offenisve, removing them would go against what @LOCATION1 stands for and our @CAPS1 rights. Censoring libraries would go against our  @CAPS2 of @CAPS3, @CAPS2 of the @CAPS5 and it would allow other people to decided for the whole society what is and is not appropiate for our libraries.     Censoring our libraries, violates our @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. It allows people to not fully express their ideas or beliefs in writting with the fear of the reprocussion of not being accepted into libraries. Authors, @CAPS8, and @CAPS9 write down things that influence them, weither it be a book, about murder, to a article,about tornadoes, its their words. Who are we to keep their words from being read or seen in the libraries.     Another @CAPS10 right it violates is the @CAPS2 of the @CAPS5.Which is the right for @CAPS8 to write what they feel is neccassary in a newspaper, weither it be factual or not and not encounter legal or any reprocussions.     If libraries did censor the materials in the building, who would decided what would be removed? Would there be a vote? Everyone would  not feel the same way in this situation. Removing an item from the library would effect everyone different. Some might be glad, some might not care, or some might be upset that it was removed.Who would have the upper hand in this situation? Whose opinion would be in affect?      I feel that libraries should not censor their materials, but i do belive that everything has a place. Things that are offensive to some people, should have an area with something that notes it is and mabe be offensive to certain people. That way people who are offended by those certain items content will not  have to be confronted with it and those who feel it is not offensive will have the opition to endulge in it"	6954	6955
4967	2	"Censorship, in some ways, can send a strong message to those who view it. But is it really that important as some people stress it out to be? What is censorship really protecting? You are bound to see things in your lifetime that wished you never have seen, but hey, that's life. I guess the real question is, at what age should censorship be allowed?     Of course when you see a kid of adolescent age, listening, watching, or even reading something inappropriate, you think to yourself what the world has come to. When I was at that age, I had started to become more curious about things, but not to the extent that it is present day. I guess that as technology advances, the age groups seem to become more stimulated as to what is going on present day. As technology advances, you start to learn more about the outside world at what it has become and that is where censorship comes in place.     Censorship is good for some age groups, but not for all of them. For adolescents, censorship is great because you don't want them to get the wrong idea about somethings. As they start to mature, their brains start develop new ideas, they start looking at things differently, and they begin to become more curious. Everyone goes through that stage of curiosity and its only human.      I do believe that certain marterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be censored, but not removed from shelves in the libraries. Sure, somethings @MONTH1 be found offensive, but that depends on the person who finds it that way. There @MONTH1 be others who think differently and who @MONTH1 have their own opinion on what they find offensive. But everyone is different, right? Not everyone is going to think the same way and have the same opinion on censorship. Others @MONTH1 think that it is good to keep the materials on the shelves, and others @MONTH1 think that it is not such a good idea.      In the end, everyone will have their differences but things will always be found the same. Should materials that are found offensive to some people be taken off book shelves? In my opinion, no, they should not, because in doing so everything will be found offensive. Here is what I have to say, if you find it offensive, then why are you looking at it in the first place?"	6956	6957
4968	2	"Most libraries ave books in them some offensive to others do you think we should take them off. I am going to say wat I think is best. Some of them have history in them, what is going to  happen to all the books off the shelves, and some can be your religion. You be suprised wat people say about the books.     Some of the books have history in them from like your family. If you take off the books then when people look for there history or some kind of history what are they going to do because the book won't be up there. Like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 its kind of racist if you think about it because of the confederate side had slaves and they were black. You have a big project and one of the books they need and libraries took it off the shelf. What are you going to do tell your teacher and then get an @CAPS3 on your project. Most people go in and try to find the real information in the books so that they know wat happened unlike people on the internet were some of it is false.     What is going to happen to all the books on the shelves. Were are they going to go. You can't just put them in one place there would be to many and you can't burn them thats bad for the enviroment. People could buy them but you'll have alot of extra left and if there offensive then who is going to buy them. If no one buys them then you'll have alot of books that just take up space and so just leave them oon the shelves because people can ge over books.     Some of he books can be there religon. If you take that off the shelves then they are going to be real mad. They might do something criminal like and start throwing a fit and throwing  some books around. It would be disrespectful to them to because they can be any religon and I don't think people wat to sit for like a week going threw all the books. I mean you might get it done and then they want the books back up there i think people would get real mad over that. If you throw awa books then thats just wasten trees any ways. People learn form books even if they're offensive.     So I think that you sshouldn't throw away books because it would be a waste of time, because people want to learn about history or there history, and some books have different religon"	6958	6959
4969	2	"Removed from the shelves     I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.  I agree with the quote by author Katherine Paterson that if we didn't want our children to read a certain book then we could take it off the shelf, but if everyone did that, then we wouldn't have any more books left on the shelf for any of us.     Last year, there was speculation as to whether or not @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should be a part of the cirriculum.  The language in that particular book can be offensive to some people because it uses the 'n' word.  I read To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 in middle school and it also had some offensive language.  Don't you think that if middle schoolers are allowed to read To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2, then high schoolers should be allowed to read @ORGANIZATION1.  They are both classic pieces of literature that should be in the cirriculum because they send good messages.     Another reason why certain media shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive is because almost anything could be found offensive.  If we eliminated all of the materiel that people didn't like, then there would be nothing left to read, watch, or listen to.  If there was nothing left on the shelves for people to check out, libraries wouldn't make any money.  They would go out of business.  People would lose their jobs all because others find the media offensive.     I also think that if you think that something is offensive, then you should stop reading, watching, or listening to it.  Use common sense.  For example, you wouldn't take a bite of something that you didn't like and keep eating it.  If you don't want your child to read something, then tell them not to read it, don't ruin it for everybody by completely getting rid of it.     Again, I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are founf offensive.  If this happened, people would lose their jobs.  I think that if you find a book offensive, then don't read it."	6960	6961
4970	2	"I don't beleive that books that seem offensive and or movies should be taken down off of the shelves since people need to know what the world is like by reading or watching a history movie about things such as racism and descrimination.  An example of an offensive movie could be the time era where @PERSON1 tried to unite blacks and whites and yes this time era does seem offensive, but it really isn't because it tells the truth about how an african american man risked his life just to remove so much hate and racism in the world and it @MONTH1 even help lead to teens trying to figure out whether they should be racist or not. Racism is something that I do deal with almost every day of my life, but the reason this happens is because of teenager's parents that put the thought of racism into their chids heads causing them to grow up and think that way.      I even have friends that have parents that are racist and they don't believe in being racist and I bet that its because they did their own research and found out that racism isn't right and that their parents are wrong. Offensive things are said every day to thousands of teens and most of these statements come from the way that they grew up and if they actually sat down and opened up a history book, which can usually be found in LIBRARIES, then they probably would start to change their views after a while about other races and come to the conclusion that everyone is equal, no matter what color your skin is and that they really aren't any better than anyone else and there isn't anyone that's better than them.      I also understand that there are books about slave owners and people of the sort that can lead young teens into beleiving that racism is o.k., but the only way that the chance for them to pick up another book and start reading about how slaves felt and how racism was actually ended along with all of the @CAPS1 people that risked their lives in hopes of one day that a new world would come about where blacks and whites could get along and live together in harmony, we as americans need to let them have that chance by leaving the so called offensive books on the shelves and inflict better laws against racism so that we can come to this day one day one person, at a time. An persuasive law could be if the person was caught doing racist acts, as in a high schooler, the first offense would be that they would have to right the sentence '@CAPS1, mexican, etc. people are equal in every way to white, mexican, etc. ' a hundred times, the second offense would be that the person would have to write a report of the persons family history that consisted of at minimal @NUM1 paragraphs, and the final offense would be considerable expulsion. We can make a change one person at a time, but we have to work together and try three times as hard to come to the day that I stated early in my essay, and if we can't do it, then who will?"	6962	6963
4971	2	"I am against censorship, i think people should have the right to read whatever they want as long as it appeals to their intrest. Yeah some topics or subjects @MONTH1 offend other people, but its their choice as to weather or not to pick the book up and read it. But, in saying that, i believe their should at least be a proper age suggestion, or even a grade suggestion to ensure that the material is suitable for the person intreasted in the book. And that they understand the book.      You should be able to comprehend the material thea you are about to read, as opposed to being completley oblivous, or un aware of what the subject is mainly about. There are some topics that i @MONTH1 not be intrested in, but that doesnt mean someone else might enjoy the material. So to conclude this essay, i would have to say that i am against censorship, but not of all forms."	6964	6965
4972	2	"I think that the libraries are resposable for their books or the things they have, but sometimes it happens that they have some materials that aren't really good for kids like movies, books, music or magazines. There are situations where the libraries can't control the problem because they don't know whos going to get that book or that movie or magazine that has offensive content. I think that  parents or someone that is mature enough should get involved with the kids or with someone whos going to get something from a library. I dont think that libraries should remove those book they just need to find ways to control the problem and not the our children get offensive books or ect.     There's many ways we can solve this problem or at least try to get control of it. First of all when a little kid goes to library asking for a book they should help him find a good book that can be good for him that is not going to show him bad stuff. that will help the libraries to not get to remove stuuf that are offensive bacause they would have control of their materials by helping the people make the right choice.     Parents should teach their child that there a lot of bad stuff out there that they need to be carefull with because sometimes  there are materials that show bad stuff or that influences little kids to do or try to act like someone that they have read about. this is like one of my own experieces because i have been to a library before and the books are there for us you can get any book you want if it is just there on the shelve but sometimes those books that you see there have bad stuff that someone like a little kid or someone whoe doen't know can get ad they can get influenced by the story sometimes by a character. You should be responsable too because the person that is in charge of the library is not going to be behing you telling you what book you should get you should be responsable for what you do and help our children be resposable in life because there's alot of stuff out there that is bad.          The other thing that libraries can do is set up  a system that they can separate the materiasl like for age.They can put the books for little kids separated from the books that are for an older child. they can also get more people in the libraries to be checking on the person that is going to get a book show them where the good books are not just let them go on their own because maybe they can get a book that is going to have bad stuff.     I think that both libraries and parents are responsable for the actions of the children because librearies are supose to have control of their materials, not just let anyone get whatever they want for example ' If a little kid goes to a library and gets a magazine or a book that is not for his age what happens if he gets like a magazine that is for an adult i think ths in tha case the resposability belong to  the library because they should not let him get that'. Don't you think that true? There are alot of ways we can help fix this, parents should get ore involved with their children that way we can help the libraries and our society to be good because is not the libraries or parents fault both are resposable and it depends how you educate your kids too! 'If we all work together we can fix this problem'"	6966	6967
4973	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , I am an @CAPS4 and I do not believe in cersoring anything. It is our right as americans to have freedom of the press and the freedom to speak our minds. Even if the book or movies have an idea different from mine who am I to say it is wrong.      It also wrong because you can not set a standard for what is right or wrong. What one person say is wrong another will disagree. Such as on the radio and televison when someone is saying 'god damn' they bleep out the word god and not damn when many people would find damn to be cuss word. I on the other hand I find nither to be offensive.     I was reading a book that many would count as offensive. I was reading a clockwork orange.The book is about how anything comes back to you. It is not at my school because it is considered wrong. The book had some strong points to it and a clear message which could help out todays youth but because of it violence it is wrong to read.     Also someone once said 'if they burn books they burn people' and some years later they did burn people otherwise known as the holocust maybe that is true for the cersorship as well if they cersor books it wont be long before they try to cersor life.      Cersorship goes against nature as well. life is not cersored we all know what the world is really like the moment we are born so who exactly are we feeding this lie to. If we cersor things then we will also make it hard on kids they will trusting , unknowing  and set up for failure if we dont show them the truth about life.     Cersorship is wrong because no one can say what is right exactly  we were all rised different. It is wrong because it goes against our rights and it goes against nature. So be with me and dont support cersorship"	6968	6969
4974	2	"Everyone can think of something that is against their views and beliefs. But not everyone believes in or has the same values as everyone else around.      If you think the books, magazines, movies, and music are not for what your believe in, do not check it out of the library, or watch the movie, or even listen to the music.      Some people and their views believe in what the books and magazines have to say, what the movies show, or even the message the music is trying to get out. But then again there are people who are against it.      If you are for what they are teaching you, then check the books and magazines out, rent the movies, listen to the music. It's your own decision for what you want to do.     If you are against what they are teaching you, then ignore the fact they're even there. Don't check the books and magazines out, don't rent the movies, and don't listen to the music.     Just because you think they are wrong and giving the wrong message, doesn't mean everyone else around agrees with you. Therefore they shouldn't be totally taken off the shelves at the library, or not sold in movie stores, or even not played on the radio.     For example, I personally do not believe in racism. I cannot stand when people are rude to anyone of a differnt race aside from theirs. But every day in my town, I see people wearing the rebel flag, I hear people who make rude comments to the people of a different race, I see people doing rude things to them. But I just ignore it. That's all you can do anymore. Just ignore it, and move on.     Another example I've had with something I don't believe in would be the war. Why is our country helping other countries, such as third world countries when the same problem is happening in our own country. We will do anything to help other countries, but we never help our own. We have starving adults and children here in the @LOCATION1. But do we help them? I haven't seen it happen yet. We also have many homeless people here, without housing and food, yet we're still putting other countries first on our list.     If you read things you don't believe in in magazines and books, watch them on movies and television shows, hear it in music or on the radio, just ignore it. Just because you don't believe in what is happening doesn't mean everyone else around agrees with your point of view. If you don't like it, don't check that book out, watch that movies, or listen to that type of music."	6970	6971

I believe that libraries in this day and age are not as useful as they were before. Not only do we have unusful magazines, but now there are unnecessary movies that libraries should not  carry. Compuer rooms are now being used in a way that is not very productive.     When I think of a going to the library for a @ORGANIZATION1, I think of magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1. I think of magazines like that because they have very good information in them that could possibly help a student write a paper, or come up with good answers for a homework assignment.      Just the other day I went to the library to find something on @LOCATION1. Of course there were @ORGANIZATION1 articles about him, but I stumbbled upon a @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1. When I saw that I was a little suprised. I believe that magazines like that should not be found in libraries because they are full of gossip and who even knows if they are true. I think that if someone wants a @ORGANIZATION1 like that, they should go to a store and purchase it on their own.     Not only are magazines getting out of control, movies are too. I feel as if libraries should just have movies that are either informative, or historical. My friend saw 'The @CAPS1' on the shelves at a local library. I think that is insane. Children should not be able to get their hands on a movie like that at a library in my opinion. It is very offensive to see things like that in a library.     Music in libraries are starting to get offensive as well. I found that libraries had @CAPS2's by @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I love their music, but some of their songs are very offensive. Although many people like the rap stars of @DATE1, they should not be rented out in libraries. If I had children I would definately not want them getting their hands on those kind of @CAPS2's.      But, I do understand that things some people @MONTH1 find offensive other people do not. Therefore, I think that it is very hard for a library to take things off of the shelves because it is offensive to one person. If they did take away each thing that offends someone, more than likely there would not be very many items on the shelves anymore.     In some libraries, they have computer labs. I think that libraries should definately crack down on their rules within those computers. Last week my friend went to the library to type a paper because her computer crashed at home. I told her that it should be easy typing a paper at our library in town would be easy, so she went.     When my friend arrived she went immediately to the computer lab. She was suprised to see that the lab was full, and there were no open seats for her. So, she sat on the couch and waited until someone was finished. She began to look around and not one single person was working on something very useful. Everyone was on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Libraries are a place to study, and get work done. I feel as if they really need to start cracking down and block those sites, or set a @ORGANIZATION1 limit for people that are using them.      Overall, @DATE1 I would not go to a library except the one at school. Many libraries are just not as usefu anymore like they used to be. They are starting to be very offensive, and out of line"	6972	6973
4976	2	"What is offensive? Everyone has something that they find offensive but not everyone finds the same things offensive. librrarys should not have materials removed just cause someone thinks it is offensive, if that were to happen then librarys would slowly lose all their book. If all the books are taken out then it is no longer a library. what one person finds offensive @MONTH1 be another persons favorite book, so removing a book from the library hinders many people who do not find the book offensive."	6974	6975
4977	2	"Over the years censorship has lost it's integrity. Certain regulations have been added on and certain rules have been lost throughout the years. People considered it respectful if things like drugs would be out of their children's reach, but today is a new day and things have changed. Only the really horrible books should be taken off of the shelf, or atleast put an age restriction on them.      Books, music, movies, and magazines have evolved to fit a new generation.This new generation of people, that are growing and learning how to be adaults, have been exposed to a lot more than anybody could imagine. Hundreds of counts of deaths, drugs, sex, and war have been played out in front of the eyes of people through books and movies. Rappers have evolved from big city thugs to superstars and role models of the new generation.      Many of todays population can handle these things. There are certain restrictions that are there for a purpose, and those need to be respected. A movie is restricted for people older than seventeen for a reason. Drugs, sex, and violence are certainly not things that we want to be showing to first graders, but todays @CAPS1 can handle a little more. This is when libraries start to put things in different categories and age restrictions.      Different categories might include an adault section, a young-adault section, and a kids section. Most libraries today have these places pretty well mapped out for this purpose. Numerous things you would find in a required reading book in high school would upset the mothers and fathers of todays elementery. So, librarians must have decided to section it off.      Libraries should not take the books off the shelves. We learn from stories that certain things are wrong. Bad men, like @CAPS2 @PERSON1 in The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been created to help kids learn. If kids discovered these things by themselves it would be a different world. We study history so intensively, because we do not want it to repeat itself.      It would be very wrong of them if they allowed today's youth discover things for themselves. They might like the bad things. What kind of world would it be then? Certain books are for certain age groups, and that is how it should stay. Keep the books on the shelves, because we can learn from our mistakes and grow into a better world"	6976	6977
4978	2	"There are many libraries in the world. All libraries contain books, types of music, movies, and magazines and other things as well. Although all libraries should be a learning environment, some @MONTH1 not be. They @MONTH1 contain books and movies with inappropriate things in them. With this, on behalf of all children, I beleive that certain books, or whatever it @MONTH1 be, should be removed from the shelves because kids @MONTH1 see pictures that they shouldn't see, @MONTH1 read about things that are not important at their age, or listen to songs that have offensive wording in them.     Kids love looking at pictures, even drawing pictures. The last thing I would want my child observing is a nasty picture that @MONTH1 be in a magazine. Magazines contain an excessive amount of information about people, most of which are famous people. In a lot of cases there are pictures of people that are practically naked. They show off their bodies in a way that is not right for children to see. For children to see their favorite actor or singer in a magazine dressed in a horrible way is not right. Kids look up to famous people, and now they @MONTH1 feel that in order to be famous, they have to do those things. Magazines with disgusting pictures in them should not be found in a library because children that want to find awesome cartoons shouldn't have to flip through one with men and women showing off their bodies to realize that it's the wrong one.      Children also love to flip through books. I know in a lot of libraries they have books that have to do with adult things. If children got ahold of these books they would be asking a lot of questions. '@CAPS1's this?' '@CAPS1's that?' For many parents, they don't want to have to explain to their children at such a young age @CAPS1 those things @MONTH1 be. No child should be able to walk through a library and have the chance to pick out an adult book.      There are many types of music out in the world. Some of which are not needed in a library. Music can be very offensive to many people. The song could be racist or just making fun of people in general.Those types of songs should not be found in a library. Kids could easily go pick out a @CAPS3 and listen to it at home not realizing @CAPS1 they chose. @CAPS1 they @MONTH1 hear is something very inappropriate. @CAPS1 kids @MONTH1 start to do is like that type of music or use those offensive words. Music with discriminating words in them should not be found in a library.     Libraries contain many books, types of music, movies, and magazines. Some of these materials @MONTH1 contain pictures that children shouldn't see, children @MONTH1 get their hands on books they shouldn't read, or they @MONTH1 listen to music that shouldn't be heard by little ears. On behalf of all children, any books, magazines, or whatever it @MONTH1 be should be taken off of shelves if they are offensive in any way"	6978	6979
4979	2	"How often do you go to a library? A lot of people go to libraries to look up information for projects, to study, to help them learn on a certain subject, or even just for the fun of it. Well who gets to decide what goes on the shelves in a library? Who gets to say if it is appropriate or not? What one person thinks is inappropriate, another person @MONTH1 think it is fine. I am going to share some very good examples of why things shouldn't be taken offensively.      I am going to give you my first example. We see a book in the library, talking about slavery and how blacks were treated so much different. If you are a colored person you @MONTH1 find that offensive, but to a lot of people that is just history. Living in this big world, we deal with hardships everyday and one of those @MONTH1 be something that is offensive to us. In all honesty, people have to learn to blow things off and grow up a little.      If a book in a library is there for people to check out, then obviously it is going to be okay for you, or anyone else to read. It @MONTH1 not be appropriate for a certain age group, but thats why libraries are divided up, to seperate things that are inappropriate for certain age groups. A lot of books, movies, and magazines are there to help us better understand things in life. Why should they be taken offensively? Yes, we @MONTH1 hope that our children or grandchildren dont see some things, but wouldn't you rather them see it on your time, rather than some friend of theirs or even a stranger tell them about it. It @MONTH1 help them better understand something one day, so really it is not offensive.      Another example @MONTH1 be, you have a big health exam  @DATE1 over sexual reproduction. It's @DATE2, and you have forgotten your book at home and you really need to study. So, you go to the library and they have documentaries, video clips, and books on sexual reproduction. Now, if some people found that offensive, and said it needed to be taken off the shelves, how would someone be able to study, or even learn more about about that topic?     My final example is going to be about a home-schooled child. There are a good percent of home-schooled children in the @LOCATION1 today. A lot of the time, those children don't really know what it is like out in reality. They have to learn everything on their own time. So they should be able to go to the library to look up things, to learn, and grow up mentally. If you take away things that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people like: the history of the @ORGANIZATION1, slavery, the epidemic of @CAPS1, sexual reproduction, the mortality of concentration camps, and maybe even a book about dating, how are those home-schooled children going to learn some things that they don't teach you in school?     A counter-point @MONTH1 be inappropriate pictures in a book. Yes, examples are nice. We really @MONTH1 not need them though. I do agree with that. Some things @MONTH1 be too gruesome, gross, unappealling, or just down right disgusting to show in books, movies, or magazines. No age group needs to see anything remotely close to that. Things can be explained deep enough in words that examples are not neccessary.       In conclusion, I hope I have proved something to you. Hopefully you have realized that things don't need to be taken offensively. A lot of things in libraries are there for people to learn and if we didn't have some of those things, a lot of our world would be in the dark on certain subjects we are faced with everyday in life and in the workforce. So, next time you think something is offensive, think again about how that @MONTH1 really help someone learn and/or grow as a person"	6980	6981
4980	2	"In todays day and age of accessing anything we can imagine just a click away, we are faced with subjective materials everyday. In order to get the most information you @MONTH1 have to fight through offensive materials. To make a thorough arguement towards a case you have to look through the most broad amount of material possible. That is why I belive that there is no reason to sensor the libraries material.      Books such as 'The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4 of @CAPS5' are @CAPS6 literature classics. These books are read in many schools throughouth the country. Both books have subjective material in them but are full of life lessons, and give people a possible new outlook on life. Who would be the person who decides what @MONTH1 be offensive material? My mother @MONTH1 find some things a lot more offensive then I would find them, so how would we decide what to keep an what to get rid of?      Todays youth is faced with offensive material everyday, and that is a problem. One place that a child should not have to face offensive material is a public library. It would make a great deal of sense to make a section of the library an area for only people over a certian age where that subjective material can be displayed. This way the offensive material can still serve as a source of information, and is not in the way of children.      In conclusion offensive material can serve as a pourpose of giving knowlege towards a subject and give different views on a matter. Although I do beleive that there should be a section of the library where you can find this material and only people of a certian age should be allowed in this section"	6982	6983
4981	2	I think that anything and everything to a extrem limite should be aloud on the shelves. But if its a book then no matter the book or the author it should be aloud to be on the shelves to be read . Movies on the other hand should be censored to a limite. Now if there is extrem nudity and sexeuall conduct then of course we dont want our small children or reblous teens to be seeing that but if it jus shows slight nudity or just has bad launguge that should be aloud.     There is nothing bad about hearing or reading about something 'bad'. How else do we learn? Drugs are the worst way to live a life correct? So that is a bad subject to be showing people correct? So take everything off the shelves about drugs would put a stop to it? I think not. Even though drugs are terrible keep what we know about them on the shelves to learn from it and make sure there is no way to live a life that way.      If there was nothing left to learn or be concerend about then how can we even teach half the things we do in school. In health we teach about eveything there is to know about sexuall acts and the outcomes. Is that not inaproprete to be talking about in school? And yet we do anywasy to be a good informer and warn.     So i believe we should not have censouship on @PERCENT1 of things we do have. txt me ;) @NUM1	6984	6985
4982	2	"People say that there is a lot of books in some libraries that are offensive or even to adult for others to read and that those types of books should be vanished from the libraries at once. They are right because im tired of children seeing books on shelfs that contain a lot of adult nudity and profound languang in them. those types of books don't belong in a public library, neither do books that talk about race and religion in a bad way.     When you walk into a library you think you would see nice books about life, things for children, and books that make everybody happy. Well you don't see those types of books anymore these days, you only see religous and hate in todays society. Would you let your children read about how today terrorists could easy kill them with out knowing? I wouldn't! These types of books could make a child become a convict in the future.     Another thing that needs to leave libraries is movies and music that contain strong body language and nudity. Would you let your child listen to a man rap about drugs and sex? I know I wouldn't. Children shouldn't b listening to the type of music, they should be listening to music they hear on disney, kids radio, and not stuff about how some dudes wheels got jacked cause he was high.     I think that libraries need to stop worring about what is best for bussiness, and start worrying about what children are learning these days from what they hear and read. If the libraries take the profound books, music, movies, magazines, and television shows out; then I believe that it will make a big difference in todays and the futures society. Dont you think so too?"	6986	6987
4983	2	"When people step foot into a library, they expect to see a variety of books and magazines that you can choose from. Many different people and readers come through looking for many different types of books they find interesting. So should libraries be allowed to choose what is appropriate for people of all different ages to read? No, books, music, movies and magazines that contain inappropriate material should not be taken off the shelves.     Some books, music, movies, and magazines are indeed inappropriate for an elementary student, but can be appropriate for high school and college students. If there is that much of a concern that younger children are going to get there hands on the wrong material, maybe libraries should make it to where there is a seperate room for them. It should not be establised for a library and critics to make decisions that parents should be making. What is appropriate for an immature freshman and what is appropriate for a mature freshman are two different things. This should be decided by the parents and the individual.     A book that is banned is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. The book is considered inappropriate for today's readers because of racial slurrs. What if a student is doing a project and they have to pick a book that has to do with racism back in the day? They certainly won't be able to purchase the book from there local library. This is the problem with banning books, it should be up to teachers and parents on what their students and children read. Not what the library thinks is too graphic. Even with other people, like critics that say the book, movie, music, or magazine is too inappropriate; I don't think they should have the right to ban the item for all people.      For an @CAPS3 class right now, there are books on the list to read over the @DATE1 that talk about rape, sex, drugs, etc. Are those books too graphic for the age group? Obviously not, or the teacher wouldn't have assigned them. I think that all the books, movies, music, and magazines that are deemed 'too graphic' should not be decided by the critics and/or libraries. But only by teachers, parents, and children. I for one, had to go online and buy a book because it was banned from libraries. After I read the book, I sat and asked myself why the book was banned. I went online and found out it was banned because of cursing. But while I was reading, I didn't even stop to think after I crossed a curse word. This is just another example as to why items shouldn't be banned. Some people can handle this that type of language better than others can. And if they're reading it and they feel too offended, they can stop and pick another book.      What should be done about the censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines? I think that they should be put in a different room, and if you are accompanied by an adult, you @MONTH1 enter the room. This solves the problem of the library getting into trouble because an angry parent found their child reading something they thought was too inappropriate. And it also solves the problem of students not being able to purchase a book because the library says its too graphic for them. I believe it should be up to the parent and the reader if the book, music, movie, or magazine is not suitable for the age or level of reading. I strongly believe that the items listed should not be banned from local libraries. Just because of the simple fact that it's a bit discriminating. Therefore, I believe that banning books should stop."	6988	6989
4984	2	"Should libraries censorship there magazines, books, music, movies, and etc. Well there is many different opinions about this, some people will say yes and then you will have others taht would say no. But in my opinion i think libraries should censor there stuff to a degree or have seperat areas for kids than adults.     My first reason why they should censor things is beacuse you will get nosy little kids who like to do the oppisite of what they are told, they will go into sections there are not supposed to and look at adult books and fine some pretty graphic things. Now if you have seperatr floors for kids and adults you really wouldnt have to worry about ittle kids reading or looking ath thing they are nto supposed to.     Movies should be censored because no matter what the ratings are on the movies there is always something bad in the movies. Go to the library and rent movies to watch for little one and there comes up graphic images or even language that is not suitable for the little ones.     Music also should be censored because no matter what kind of music the lyrics are awfull, the language is dirty and most parents wouldnt want there child to hear them words till they are like out of college. Library needs to be censored and suitable for boys, girls, and adults. Parents take there kids to libraries to read nice and happy books, not dirty books or magazines.     Libraries are important and they dont need to be full of dirty books and magazines. Kids love to go to libraries and look at picture books and parents wouldnt like there kid to pick up a magazine and catch them looking at dirty pictures in that magazine."	6990	6991
4985	2	"Books have been around for so long, giving us information, entertaining us and letting us see different people's views and opinions to which makes us ponder more and open our minds and accept the fact that not everyone will agree with our own thoughts.     Removing materials, such as books, music, magazines etc. that might offend some people, is wrong. Everyone has a different state of mind and might enjoy what others don't. Removing materials like that is taking away another person's hardwork, views or opinion and shielding it away from the public who they intended it for.    The library is always divided into sections and the people who might find this materials offensive can always have the choice to stay away from it.    Ofcourse, there are still extremes that should not be allowed in our library shelf such as inappropiate or extremely vulgar materials. There are always nonsense materials that doesn't only offend but leads us to a wrong way. Songs that are sang by @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper who spends half his life in jail, is definitely one example of an extreme. His songs talk about drugs, killing other people because they 'disrespect' him and other various stuff that children do not need to hear. It's offensive and potentionally harmful and those kind of materials shouldn't be in our public library. Overall, i strongly agree that removing materials in our library is not right. All materials offend at least one person at times, but if it's not potentionally harmful or an extreme, it should be left in our libraries' shelf to be picked up by people with open minds and wants to explore another person's view of what is right in their own mind."	6992	6993
4986	2	"Libraries censorship is a very big topic for dicussion and can bring a lot of agrument with it. My opion on it is that they shouldn't really censore it because we should be able to read what we want to read. We should also be able to listen to what we want to listen along with watching what we want to watch. Some parents probably think that there kids shouldn't be reading or listening to some inapproprate stuff but really i think it should be the kids choice.       I mean if you a little kid then of course you shouldn't be able to pick out stuff that is inapproprate for you age but when your older you should have your own choice on the subject. In school libraries they are going to censore it no matter what our opion of the matter is but we should be able to get what books we want to. Its not like just because you let us choose what book we want that we are going to be more defiante or anything. We just want the freedom to choose what we read, listen to and even watch.     Most movies are made for older age groups, so its really hard to find movies for the younger generation. Even as younger kids we need some help, so maybe on the older inapproprate stuff then we @MONTH1 need a little help but that doesn't mean that you should be able to tell us what we can watch. Of course movies are going to have inapproprate stuff on them exspecial with what people are making now days but eventally we are going to want to test it out so why not let us do that now.     Magazines are a little different i think. Magazines are out in public for everyone to read and to see. I don't think they can even censore magazines because all they care about is getting a story. They aren't going to censore magazines because they don't want to lose money and if they do that there is a good chance that they will lose some. A reason they will lose some is because people want that kind of stuff in there life, they don't want a kiddy verison just because a couple people took offence to it.     Some music is really offence. I don't think you should try to censore music because thats how the artist that wrote it and sung it feels. People have a right to show how they feel. If we try to take that away then we are taking away there freedom of speech basically! Its like if i want to show my expression through how i dress then, you shouldn't be able to tell me i can't. Some music does lead to people being depressed and attempting suicide or even actually going through it but its a person's choice to listen to what they want and if they choose to listen to something that makes them depressed then thats there choice!      So basically i'm saying that libraries shouldn't have a choice to censore book, magazines, movies or music. Its our choice to do what we want and yes sometimes we need some guidance but if you tell us no we will only find a way to do the opposite of what you want us to do anyways. So i think that the best choice is to just let us do what we want and give us help when we need it or give us your opion."	6994	6995
4987	2	"If I were to go into a library and there was a book that was offensive to me, I would want them to remove it. Although, there could be a book that I liked and someone else could take it offsensivley. There are so many people in this world that take things differently. Everybody has their own things that they like. It wouldn't be fair to remove anything because there would be nothing left.     When I was @NUM1, I met this guy. We started talking and eventually ended up dating. Well, once @DATE1 got around, my body started to act different. I told my mom about it and she took me to the doctor's. They did some tests on me and a test came back positive. The test was a pregnancy test.      If there was books, magazines, movies, etc. about being against teen prenancy, I would be some what be offensed. Teen pregnancy isn't the right thing, it should wait until marriage. But people make mistakes, and do things they shouldn't which get them into this position. I didn't plan it, and I definitely didn't expect to get that kind of news.      I would also be very offensed about abortions. Once you find out that you're pregnant, that little 'thing' inside you is no longer a 'thing'. It's a human, an innocent human. Some people don't protect theirselves from this. They shouldn't be so mad or extremely surprised that it happened. I believe that once something happens, it was probably meant to be. It just wouldn't be right if things were removed because of that one person"	6996	6997
4988	2	"Should they put books on the shelf If they are not appropriate for school or In a libary. They should remove them if they have bad stuss in them. The shelf would  be so bare if they  removed all the bad books from the shelf. They would have books bu they are getting realy bad with bad stuff. Why do schools have inappopriate stuff for the kids to read?   First of all, @CAPS1 I saw a book that was not appropiate for school, I thought @CAPS2 would be a good book. But, @CAPS1 I started reading, @CAPS2 was so bad that I had to return @CAPS2 the next day. @CAPS1 I returned @CAPS2, the people asked me @CAPS7 @CAPS2 was. I told them that @CAPS2 was inappropiate for school. I thought @CAPS2  would be a good book, but @CAPS1 i started reaing @CAPS2, was so bad that I had to return @CAPS2. They asked ' @CAPS7 was the book' and I said '@CAPS2 was good I guess'.      For example, the book was horrible because @CAPS2 was talking about the nasteys things, that syou could imagine. Then i got a new book that was a little bit better than the last one. @CAPS1 i took that one back the people asked if that one was a lot better and i said ' yes'.      Finally, If they just take all the bad books off the shelves, then the shelfs would be a little bare but not by much. If they wanted to they could get more books, but not inappopiate books for the kids to read. Libarians could get maginzines for them to look at and read. Libarians can also get a lot of things for them to do in the libary. If they just took down all the inappropriate books then maybe people would stop in more to look at the books.           In conclusion, they can take down all the nasty books and put them where nobody can find them. People would have books if they took all the bad books down. Libarians can always get more with the money that they save or they can buy with their own money. Libarians or  people thy can also pu money down and save @CAPS2.

4990	2	Libraries are a place where anyone in need of knowledge can go to learn. People of all ages go to libraries whether it is for information or their just looking for an intresting book to fill their time. But a certain degree of censorship is definately needed in such a place.      Libraries are full young kids looking for a fun book to read with their parents. If I am a parent i don't want my children browsing for a book and coming across somthing that is inapropriate. Kids are easily influenced and if they just happen to come across a book and read a few pages you never know how that child is going to take it. The child could read it and think '@CAPS1 this kid is cool' and begin trying to repeat whatever was described to him.     I think there are a few different ways of dealing with this problem. The first that comes to mind would be to have a whole different floor for kids above the age of ten or somthing close to that. Always just have a librarian watching for kids who have run off and wondered up the stairs to the section. This would keep the information in the library but keep it blocked off from those who shouldn't have ahold of it.      The second idea i have would be to have a whole different building. Their could be a smaller building that could be the childrens library. Then somewhere near that build another library. That would be for people looking for things such as information on projects or novels intended for an older age group.     Libraries can be a great place for familys to go in search of some knowledge or fun. All that needs to be done is taking the right procautions. Once that has been taken care of all age groups of people will be free to go about without worrying. That is the kind of censorship we need in our libraries today.	7002	7003
4991	2	"I think that there should not be any sort of censorship in libraries. Libraries are places to find information about history or anything else. The librarians cannot change how history or whatever other topic a person found offensive.     The books in the library are written how things were or how a person wanted them to be, in fictional stories, if a person put something offensive then the person looking at it can find another book. Libraries do not need censorship because if there was, then none of the books would actually be true ;therefore, the whole library would be a fiction book store. If a person had a book removed from the shelf that they thought was offensive, later on somebody might come back looking for that book for a project in school or something important and fail their project because that person took the book off of the shelf in the library.                                                   I understand that a child might pick up a book that they should not have and bring it home, but in my thought, I think that the parents should have gone with the child instead of letting them go by themself and pick out any book they wanted. Some of the people that are complaning about censorship in libraries, I think, are irresponsible parents because they are too lazy to go with their child to go get a book with them so they let the child go pick out whatever book they want. People keep complaining of horrific things that they find in libraries in history books and other subjects, but they probably sometimes forget why those certain horrific things are there and do not even think twice about it before they talk about it to the librarian.      People are afriad for the children's sake for the censorship of books and other items in the library, which is understandable because children are very influencial especially at younger ages, but if the parents stayed with their children there would be no problem with anything because if the child picked out a book the parent thought was not right for the child, then they could just put it back and move on to another one. There, in my opinion, could be certain areas in the library that could have restrictions for certain ages. For instance, if there is a whole section that a lot of people find offensive, then the library could put a restriction that the certain section is for people eighteen and older.      In conclusion, all of the censorship and everything in libraries, I think, should not happen in libraries. I would be happy with restrictions, but not censorship."	7004	7005
4992	2	"Are offensive books and magazines to violent to read at the public library? Are they making the people in the world become violent to human nature and to other living things around them? Well I have something to tell you!          I think so and I don't think so! I think that people learn things when they are reading books and magazines. It can be either good or bad. I think that if they don't read stuff about domestic violents and all the other violents that are going on, then they will never know what is wrong or what is right.          Some people find it absolutely amusing to read about violents, while some other people try to challege themselves to read it or to just read something new. Some people imitate off of other people because of the fact that they think it is cool to see that the other person is doing it. People also like to imitate off of the book or magazine because of the fact that the things that they do in the book or magazine makes the person want to do it also and they think it is cool and okay to do. Okay lets say that in a book @PERSON1 is sleeping on his bed and @PERSON1 (the killer) creeps up on him in the middle of the night with a knife and stabs him to death with the knife and laughs a girlly laugh and jumps around and say 'I killed him, I killed him!' And then @PERSON1 comes back alive.  People, such as little kids will be entertained at this type of book because they think it is cool. Well the kids that are not so scared to read about bloody violents.          In magazines it is very different because of the fact that in the books you have to imagine by yourself. The author will let you read about it, but don't get me wrong there are somebooks that have pictures, but I am talking about the books that don't have any pictures in them. These books will sometimes have you guessing and thinking about what you are reading. But when your thinking about it you can have a mind of your own and sometimes not even be thinking the same thing the author wants you to think. In a magazine you are just looking at the picture of the violents that are going on. It makes you want to do it also.          Now! Do you understand why I think that it is a good thing and a bad thing? somethings you have to learn about and somethings are to be left alone. I just think that kids need to read about it in thier late teenage years instead of them as a child because you never know that just might be how they become.                            Thank You"	7006	7007
4993	2	"Censorship is an very important thing to me. I believe offensive material should be removed from libraries shelves. Reason being, there are a lot of youth out there that haven't been exposed to some things that are put in book, movies and magazines.      I feel that any movie that is rated above '@CAPS1' shouldn't be on the shelves because, you never know who is looking at them. Also I strongly disagree with having magazine that exploit women, simply because I dont like the way they portray women and I dont think its right to have magazines of that nature in libraries.      Music is an another big one, music plays a key role in eveyones life. So having an explict version of an @CAPS2.D. causes more damage in than any other magazine and book or even any movie. The lyrics of music can make young people do things just because of what the songs say. So thats why I believe that if its not a clean, or edited version of an album they shouldn't be in libraries.      Censorship is any very overlooked, but I think that the more we censor move, books, magazines etc, @CAPS3 can and will make a big impact on society and the world will be that much better"	7008	7009
4994	2	"Instead of removing the material that some people find offencive, the library should have them in a different room. if somebody wants the a book that is in the room then they should have to go to the front desk and ask if they can check it out. The reader has to be at least @NUM1 to check one of these materails out. this material should be returned @NUM2 days after being checked out.      If somebody wants to look at materail that some people find offensive, they shouldn't have to worry about what other people think of them or what they are reading.      If there are little kids getting ahold of this material then it should be removed from the shelfs"	7010	7011
4995	2	"Everybody goes to a library at least once in their life. When they go to a library people want to read books, listen to music, or look up information on certain topics. All sorts of people go and not everybody is the same and different people read different books and listen to different music. If somebody goes to a library and the library doesn't have the kinds of books they read or the type of music they listen to, than that just isn't any fair to those type of people.     I don't think censorship should be in libraries. It wouldn't be fair to people who might want to spend time at a library but can't because the types of music or books they like are not there at the library because of censorship. I'v been in a case where I had a project for school that I had to get done and I went to a library and couldn't get information on my project because of censorship.     There shouldn't be censorship because in my eyes it's not right. I'm sure a lot of other people would agree with me. A library can be a place to hangout and listen to music. If there is censorship some people won't be able to hangout at a library because their type of music or books to read won't be there.     I understand why people would want censorship in a library. It's a public place where everybody can go. Some people wouldn't want to hear or listen to certain types of music. The way I see it though is that if those people don't want to listen to that type of music they don't have to because it's a library and there a headphones. If people don't like certain types of books than they don't have to look at them or even go into that section.     What I'm saying is that a library is a public place and anyone should be able to walk into a library and read or listen to whatever they want. This is why I don't think censorship should be in libraries and I don't think certain materials should be removed from the shelves at libraries. If it was it wouldn't be fair to everyone in the public that want's to use their library."	7012	7013
4996	2	"In seventh grade, I saw the movie 'The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2' and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was entrigued by the story of the poverty-stricken father and son who so suddenly rose to great fortune.  When I checked the book out from my school library, my mother denied me the privelage of reading it and I was told to return it immediately the following day.  I begged and complained backing myself up by saying that the movie @CAPS3 not contain any crude or suggestive material.  Unfortunately, she had previously read the book and was decisive in telling me that it @CAPS3 contain material that she @CAPS3 not want me reading.     Although disappointed, this made me realize that just because something is in the school library does not mean that it's contents are appropriate to my values.  Just this year, a friend named @CAPS4 had a book from our school library titled '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'.  She, just as I, became attatched to the plot.  Midway through, the book evolved into a sexual teenaged love affair.  @CAPS4 was angered and had a strong desire to finish the book, but it was so crude that she finally decided to put it down.     In today's world, the '@ORGANIZATION1' of peoples' values is vast.  Many could read a book like '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' or the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2' and take no offense, while others @MONTH1 feel extremely offended.  Because there is such a wide range, it is hard for librarians to determine whether a book should be allowed in a grade school collection.  A book that I would consider unrighteous @MONTH1 be perfectly acceptable to another student, and a librarian can not make the pass or fail decision to suit every students wishes.  The movie '@CAPS11' is favorite to many people who go to my school.  At the same time, there are many people--myself included--who thought the movie to be suggestive and offending.     There are many options that a librarian can choose from, but which is the best to most fully satisfy every student?  I think that librarians should mark the library material that contains rude humor, suggestive scenes, borderline pictures, and/or other explicit adult content.  A little sticker or marking by the @ORGANIZATION2 number would allow a student searching for materials to swiftly and conveniently determine whether he/she would find the contents appropriate to his/her moral standards.  Students like myself who are liberal in ensuring that these kinds of offensive materials are avoided would be capable of avoiding such incidents.  On the other hand, those who are either fence sitters or aren't offended at all can at least approach the material with caution, knowing that someone else (the librarian or another student) found it to be innappropriate.  If a librarian happens to not read/see/hear the material when it is added to the catalog, then another student who does can report it and request that it be given a marking.     Just as Katherine Paterson says in her quote, if everything that someone finds offensive is exiled from the libraries, its whole collection will eventually fully depleat and there will be nothing left to choose from.  This tequnique of marking material that @MONTH1 offend readers is not a @CAPS5 science, but is what I think one of the best solutions to satisfy the extreme difference in moral values that we have in our culture today.  Students @MONTH1 still read something and later report that they were offended, but at least this way they cannot say that they were not previously warned."	7014	7015
4997	2	"'And then we have no books left on the Shelf for any of us'. This is the last sentence of a quote from @ORGANIZATION1. In the quote she states that all parents can think of books that they wouldn't want their children reading. She also states that if one parent has the right to take a book off the shelf than so do other parents. If this were allowed, not only for books, but also for music, movies, magazines, etc., then there would be nothing left to go to the @ORGANIZATION2 for. Every person has an opinion as to what they find innappropriate or offensive, but this should not stop others from being allowed to find it at their @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2.     Having variaties of material available is vital for many kids in order to do their schoolwork, homework, or projects. I personally know many kids who look to the @ORGANIZATION2 for certain books that are not at their school @ORGANIZATION2 for various reasons. These reasons can be violence in the books, a crude storyline, or a number of other things censored in schools. If these same books were censored at the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 as well, then where could a child go to find the information that he or she needs? Recently I had a research paper to write about the @CAPS1, @PERSON1 (The @CAPS2 @CAPS3.I.G.). I could not find any books about him at the school @ORGANIZATION2 and I did not want to have all of my sources from the internet. My only other option was the @ORGANIZATION2. If violence and gang related material were censored at the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 then I would have been limited in my resources for the research paper. Censoring @ORGANIZATION2 libraries limits a student's resources.     Not only would censorship in libraries be limiting student resources, but recreation as well. Many people go to the @ORGANIZATION2 to find a good book to pass the time reading, or find music, movies, magazines, etc., that they find interesting. If books were be to censored off of the shelves than those seeking recreational time at the @ORGANIZATION2 would be at a lose. A person should have the right to find a certain book, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4.V.@CAPS4., @CAPS5, etc., at the @ORGANIZATION2. Why should one persons opinion effect what someone else can find at the @ORGANIZATION2?     An arguement for censorship @MONTH1 be that some material is innapproprite for children or offensive to a certian group because of race, religion, etc. However, this is solved very simply by the fact that libraries are divided into different sections. If a parent does not want their child exposed to a certain type of content on adult books, they can simply send them to the children's section of the @ORGANIZATION2. In this section are children's books, movies, and computers for them to play games for their age group on. Another section libraries have is a teenage or junior section. In this section a teen can find books focused more on teenage life and magazines teens often read. Libraries also have adult sections for more mature readers. There are even designated movie, music, and computer areas for people who wish to go there as well. It seems simple enough that if a person doesn't want to see a certain type of material they would just stay out of that section of the @ORGANIZATION2. This way it could still be there for the people that do want to read, watch, listen, and enjoy everything a @ORGANIZATION2 has to offer.     Each person has their own views on what they see as offensive or innapproprite, but these views should not stifle another persons efforts in finding what they need or want at their local @ORGANIZATION2. This limits student's resources, recreation, and is easily avoided by different sections set up in libraries. Imagine what it would be like to walk into a @ORGANIZATION2 with nothing on the shelves, just emptiness everywhere you look. That is how it will be if censorship is brought into @ORGANIZATION2 Libraries"	7016	7017
4998	2	"Reading @CAPS1 is Right?     Have you ever like a book or magazine so much that you want to take it home with you but you can't? Well, that happens to everyone at every age. I am giving you a few essential details about how you can get and receive a book that you would like to read. Therefore you can know @CAPS1 you are doing that is right.     The problem is that people are only limited to take only certain kinds of books or magazines home. Whether they want to buy it or get a bargain for it the library has to consist a certain amount of copies. The district has to pay for the books that they're putting in their library's because they have to replace the one's that are stolen or lost. Where the district gets this money of from tax payers. There are enough problems with the ecomony trying to replace a very expensive book or magazine just for glamour or style.     If we were to take away book that people enjoy or that is offensive to others @CAPS1 good will that do? We as a reader need to learn and express ourselves through writing. By taking a book off shelf resticts the person to learn a new achivement in life whether it is right or wrong. They have to learn their mistakes for @CAPS1 they dont. Having a book that is offensive can should how us @CAPS2 express ourself from the past to the present. We need to explain that we need to know our history, and where we come from.      Taking a book off the shelfs that is offensive and putting some where that nobody will ever find is like taking a child that is uncontrollable and hiding him in a basement. That book needs to express themselves because that person that wrote that book took his/her time to write it and explain in details about the situation. I know @CAPS1 it feels like to read an offensivbe book but I have to disregard that because I have to learn my past and present. It makes me upset that people @MONTH1 @CAPS3 that way but you have to understand that it not just you, there are many other people out there who are against it or with it. It like expression '@CAPS3 the way your are because that is you, not them.'     In conclusion the best solution is to let the community decide whether it sould be removed from the media. The reason I say this is the best choice is because everyone can be active and also be involved with the community. By giving a detail explanantion about how they would or not would remove it form the media is up to the judge to make the final decision. Life as we know now is still continuously progressing and we need to take advantage about our lifespan, so that our children can read about our past. The people we know now need to learn about our history and respect that the fact it is offensive, but we have mature since then. So will ask you the right question, Do you know @CAPS1 your reading is right?"	7018	7019
4999	2	"Some libraries, if not many, have been censoring their contents in books, music, movies, magazines, and websites. The reason for this censorship in libraries is the possibility of offending a certain race, age, religion, sex, or opinions. Libraries believe that some things shouldn't be on the shelves if it were to offend someone or to discourage someone.      Many books, songs, or movie scenes can be taken into many possible perspectives that can offend one person and their personal beliefs. The slightest or smallest statement on a page, or in some lyrics can be taken in offence also. All of us have to think though if it's better to try to understand others' opinions, learn about something outside our own grasp, educate ourselves, or to just shut out all of the possible outcomes.     There are somethings that have happened in life that people have wrote about, sang about, or just produced that many people would recommend to be known or learned. Many factors today have stopped a numerous amount of different cultures from educating or involving theirselves. Wether it be about offence, interest, or beliefs, people will not learn or hear someone else's opinion. Everyone deserves to educate themselves in many different ways, including movies, music, books, magazines, or any other way of reasource.     If we didn't have any biased information, or didn't have anything that people could possibly percieve as biased, we wouldn't have  information at all. Many things can be taken the wrong way to a someone. There are a lot of religions, beliefs, and ages that can be offended with another. So would it be right to rid information about one thing if it contradicted the another?     All reasorces would be decreaced marginally if we took books, movies, magazines, or anything that offended someone or something. No person is the same as another. No one should be discrimated for their own personal bliefs. Therefore no one should be ridden of their resouces or possibility to learn."	7020	7021
5000	2	"Books, magazines, movies, and music are things a lot of people enjoy. They like to read or listen to things that interest them the most; it might be a romance novel or country music. Today in our world, there are a lot of words people don't like little kids hearing, such as in books or movies. I think movies, book, magazines, and music should be censored in libraries because they can be offensive to people, they can create harmful ideas, and they can show little kids things they aren't ready for.     When people get offended they tend to get very angry. They don't like reading or hearing things that offend them. Some people take it too far and get out of control, but there is a point were the censorship stops. If a person was to check out a book at the library to learn about slavery, and it offended them to a certain degree, it should be removed. Even though it is an emotionally hard topic to learn about there is a point where far is too far. The population of the world should be treated equally and when one culture is offended, the people need to try and eradicate that.    Some people enjoy reading about murders and mysterious crimes, but others are disgusted by it. A lot of books or movies go into great detail about a crime or murder. They show every step of the way on how that murder was done. Most parents wouldn't want their child knowing how to kill a person. That's when library's should put mature books, magazines, etc. in a certain section. If a person wanted to committ a crime, I guarantee there is a book or movie somewhere in this world that talks about that specific crime. Those books and movies generate harmful ideas to the people. They find out things they didn't even know was possible, and want to try it. Therefore, it could cause harm to them or the people around them.      Everybody knows that little kids like to touch and know everything that goes on around them. When libraries have magazines with inappropriate pictutres on the front, it's not good for children. The children might not be old enough to know certain things, and I don't think parents want their children seeing that. Also, in movies there are scenes that are inappropriate for little children. It's the parents job to make sure their children don't see it, but there is also a point where the movie directors have to stop it. The ratings on movies are changing everyday and sometimes the movie is worse than what the rating that was issued said. Overall it's not good for children to see things they shouldn't at their age.     As you can see censoring movies, books, magazines, and music would have a big impact on the society. People wouldn't get offened, children wouldn't see inappropriate things, and people wouldn't get harmful ideas. There is a point where censoring could be taken to far, but knowing that the libraries, movie stores, and music stores are doing it brings comfort to many people, especially parents"	7022	7023
5001	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Katherine Paterson.  I agree with her that we shouldn't be able to take a book of the shelf because people find it offensive.  Any book can be found offensive in some way.  If you could just take a book off the shelf because one person found it offensive there might not be any libraries.  Libraries should be able to contain the items they want and what people would enjoy reading, listening, or watching.  If people want a book to be banned from the library how are other people going to be able to read it?  Not all things are offensive to everyone.  If people not agree with the items the library has in it, don't pick it up.  Act like its not there and keep looking for what you came to the library for.  I believe that libraries should contain the items they want, things that are offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be to others, and someone @MONTH1 get something great out of just reading one simple book.     If libraries don't carry the books people want to read why would people go there?  They should carry the books that they think will make a person interested.  If they make sections in the libraries for adults and kids mothers won't have to worry about her child picking up 'that' book.  By making two different sections adults can find the items they want that @MONTH1 be offensive to younger children.  By having a children section adults won't have to look around in a bunch pf children books to find what they need.     What someone might find offensive another person @MONTH1 not.  Libraries can't ban a book because its offensive towards some people.  Other people still enjoying reading the book.  If they can't find the book in the local library because its banned, how are they suppose to read it?  Just because a book might have 'bad' words doesn't mean the material isn't suitable for people to read.  People who like the stuff that people want to ban won't be able to enjoy the books like everyone else.     If this book that people want to be banned is truely great, how would people ever find out?  What if by reading this book it changed your perspective on something huge in your life.  You'd never know because some people found something a little offensive in it.  This simple book @MONTH1 change your outlook on like.  Maybe the writer has gone through something you have and his book can help you get through it.  You won't ever find out because people don't like it.  Thats why libraries should carry every single book they can get their hands on.     I believe that libraries should contain the items they want, things that are offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be to others, and you @MONTH1 get something great out of just reading a simple book.  Libraries should contain any items they want so people don't have to miss out on a great book.  If someone finds a book offensive, don't look at it or read it again.  Who knows? Maybe this book will change your life"	7024	7025
5002	2	"To take materials of off library shelfs is an offence against the first amedment. Taking away a book or a mavie is like taking away what the authors or directors freedom of speech on the subjest they wish to talk about. There other way to fix such a problem. The problem is not the books, movies, music, or magazines; it's that the person choose that curtain material.   My resollution to the problem leave the material alone and take matters into your own hands.          If the books or other materials were taken of the shelf then that might start even bigger problems. The library and to maker of the material don't want to make their lifes anymore complicated. To take the materials of the shelfs is even against the @CAPS1 constitution. It is there rights as an @CAPS1 citizen to be able to exprese their thoughts through material in libraries. Taking that away might make the maker feel bad or sad in ways that some people might not undersand.          Its can be up to perants,or teachers; but it is mainly up to yourself to be able to make the right choices. Its not the materials that has the problem it might be yourself. So wait and thing alittle bit before trying to make curtain acusations about the materails that will get it taken of the selfs.          So I persuade some poeple to think and regecnize that its not the materials fault. Next time your in a library and you saw a book you don't like just skip over it. Evering thing doesn't have to be such a big deal. Also remember your decetion so make the right one"	7026	7027
5003	2	"Every person in the world has different views than what you do.  People are going to disagree with each all the time and that is life.  One topic that many people disagree over is if certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and other things should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive.  Everyone can make their own decison in what they believe in and mine would be to not remove these materials from the shelves.     It is very common for people to get offended.  In my life, I mostly get offended by what people have to say to me most of the time.  People do not think of what they have to say before they say it and it ends up being hurtful to the other person and they become offended by it.  So can people be removed from the @LOCATION1 if they offend someone?  Of course they can't.  So why should books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials have to be removed?     Everyone is entitled to make their own decisions for themselves.  If someone is offended by a book, music, a movie, a magazine, or anything else then they just simply do not have to choose to be involved with that certain piece of material again.  They can let their family or friends know how it offended them, what the topic was over, and let them make the decision to be involved or not be involved with that piece of material themselves.     When it comes to picking a piece of material, adults can make the decision for themselves, but children can not.  Children need guidance in life.  So if a child would enter a library to get a book to read, a parent or adult needs to assist them.  Parents know what is best for their child.  If the parent believes in the topic and thinks that it is ok for their child to read it,  then it is ok.  If a parent disagrees with the topic, then they do not have to let their child be involved.     People do not believe in the same things as others.  One person might be offended by a song they heard, but another person @MONTH1 learn from it.  That is another reason why certain materials should stay on the shelves.       In my life, I have read many books about teen pregnancies.  That is what motivates me to stay away from becoming sexually involved.  There are many teenagers out there that have became sexually involved and have ended up with a child at a young age.  To them, a book about teen pregnancy might offend them becaus they know that they made the wrong choice.  To others, a book about teen pregnancy might help and guide them to make a good decision and not become sexually involved.  So why take a book off the shelve that might help someone?      Everyone has their own opinion about the removal of certain materials from the shelves if they are found offensive.  My opinion is not to remove them.  Just remember that people can not be removed from the @LOCATION1 if they have offended someone.  So why should certain materials?  There is a lesson to be learned from everything you have experienced in life, even if it offended you"	7028	7029
5004	2	"While taking your child to the local library, you make your first move toward the colorful children's book section. You scanning through '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3', your curious child pulls off a magazine from a few shelves away. The offensive material such as cursing, nudity, or racist terms are far too common in this media. Now with confusing and scarring images inside of your child's mind, no one knows what the damage could cause. In society today, I believe that offensive material found in some magazines, music, and books at libraries should be stripped off of the shelves.     We live in a world today where it is acceptable to show it all - whether it be drugs, violence, sex, or foul language. As we go through this new millenium, we allow our kids to be exposed at a younger age. At the end of the day, it is essentially up to the parent to choose whether or not this exposure is okay for their child's development. Although for many, the offensive material found on television, the internet, and books are alarming. Some try to retain their kids from such foul material, but we are all trapped; exposure is everywhere.     The library is considered a safe heaven where reading, learning, and knowledge is highly encouraged. With the growing thirst for information, the library is full of reliable information. However, rude material found in many books, magazines, music, and movies have invaded the shelves. These works have poisoned the learning of young and growing minds, as well as infected the credibility of many other sources. If one wished to seek an inappropriate piece of literature, there are many other places to find them instead of the innocent library.     In my opinion, I believe that offensive material found in libraries should be removed from the shelves. They take away the true meaning of a library, and only expose the reader to various crude imagery. Our society is opening our mind, but some things can be filtered out by choice. The intergrity of a library is lowered due to these explicit material. I am not suggesting that no exposure is good for the development as a person. However, some are unnessesary, especially on the shelves of a library. They should be swapped with educational material to follow suit of the rest of the library. A library is for the growth of curiosity through reading and knowledge through credible sources."	7030	7031
5005	2	"Do you think libraries should take movies,books,and magazines off the racks if people think they are found offensive. I say no because for one everybody has their own taste and style, secondly no because people have different religious beliefs,and lastly yes because if they have things in their just anybody can go to.     To begin with, I say no they shouldn't take stuff off the rack because, everybody is different in their own way. Also people have different styles and taste in movies, books and etc. You just can't take something off the racks because you or a group of people don't like it. Also just like you or the other people that don't like it, its another person and group out there who does like it.     Seondly, I say no they shouldn't remove some things from the racks. For example, what if someone was jewish and they took all the jews stuf down and jus left the muslim stuff up. That isn't right, and is kind of considered rascim.     Last but not least, I say yes they should remove somethings. For example, if you have a kid and if they go to the library you dont want them looking at stuff they shouldn't be looking at or reading. So in some cases i say yes they because if they are not going to have age limits or somethings they yes they need to b taking off the rack.     In conclusion, you have read da article and know what my three arguments where, and if you have forgotten they are first, I say no because everyone has different tasta and styles,secondly, no because people are different religions, and last but not least, yes because if kids be in there it needs to be monitoerd"	7032	7033
5006	2	"Katherine Paterson is right about if she had the right to remove books off the shelf then you should be able to do it to. Everybody should have the same rights as everybody else. She's right about the books everybody has the desire to read.     They should keep the books,music,movies,,magazines, etc on the shelf all of the materials are use full and you can learn something for all these materials. It might not be offensive to everybody so they could leave it up there. Books can show you have to say word and show you pictures wat stuff look likes. Magazines can show you pictures and read basiclly like a book but it just got alot of pictures. I love books and the next article it gives different and new information.     Movies is just society and they jus have something that's true that happen along time ago. I seen '@DATE1' and it alot of the stuff about the world gone end. The government and other people no its not gone end in @DATE1. Movies be having to much stuff in it for the shelf. All the materials are go quality to be on the shelf because you can learn something from matertials.     I seen this happen at a library before where kids were like can this help me learn. Because he said, they have books,movies,music,magazines,etc. I said, yes all the materials help me out"	7034	7035
5007	2	"Public libraries are places where many people from all walks of life can go to find information on almost any topic imaginable. Some people find certain topics offensive and would wish books containing offensive information to be removed from the library shelves. I personally think we shouldn't because it would go against our constitutional rights, some books removed wouldn't be offensive to the majority of people, and the books that are removed could provide incredibly valuable information.      One reason we shouldn't censor libraries is because it would go against our first amendment rights. The first amendment assures citizens that they can express theirselves through writing and speech. Censoring libraries would make books that are found offensive difficult for the average person to gain knowledge from. It would also mean there would have to be a goverment ran committee that decides what books remain of the shelves and which ones are taken off. The whole purpose of the constitution was to limit goverment control especially in our daily lives. That is one reason that we shouldn't censor libraries.     Another reason that we shouldn't remove potentially offensive materials from libraries is because it @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. Everyday in the @LOCATION1 we see images of women on everything from album covers to magazines. If someone was an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 this would be extremely offensive. Would this mean that anything containing a picture of a woman would have to be removed from the library? Another person could be a @CAPS3 and find many scientific discoveries offensive. This means that any books regarding evolution, the big bang, or anything else could be banned from libraries. Followng this belief could mean that almost all books in the library would be found offensive to some group.     One of the main reasons we shouldn't censor libraries is that some books that would be removed would provide valuable information to those who need it. Many people who go to the library are taking some form of an educational course at the same time. So if someone was taking a class regarding biology it would be helpful to have extra reading material to help explain what they are studying. A major point in biology is the theory of evolution. Censoring libraries could mean that a book that would help someone understand the concept of evolution could be removed. This could seriously affect someones understanding of the natural world.     In conclusion, we use the library for many different things. We use it for gaining knowledge or to just read a good story. Censoring libraries could severely affect how we interact with libraries. We would lose the right to learn about a large variety of topics and it would promote goverment control."	7036	7037
5008	2	"Should we remove books, movies, music, and what ever else that might be discriminating off of the libraries shelf? My answer is yes and no.      Why do I say yes? I say yes because some children should not be brainwashed into believeing that some groups of people are horrible and should not be trusted because they only hear one side of the story. Not unless there are both side of the stories available to the people, the libraries should not have anything disciminating there.     Why do I say no? I say no because they should learn about the world  history and understand what happened to the world. Though I still stand by my arguement that they should hear both sides of the event, the poeple have the rights to know how science say the world was made and the evidence they have gathered to guess what happened @NUM1 million years ago.     There are many different answers for this question, and many different arguements that follows. These are my reasons and my answers. I say that knowledge should be allowed to the world as long as both sides of the story is represented."	7038	7039
5009	2	"I believe books, music, movies, and magazines       some people find offensive should be left on the shelvs. Stores and libraries should not have to remove somthing from their shelves because someone does not like that book, or movie. That goes for more than one person disagreeing with that book, or movie. Everyone on the planet is not going to agree on books, movies, or magazines. So I do not believe that books, magazines, or movies should be removedfrom the shelves.                    Books, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, while the next person finds an interst in it. We will all never agree on wat books are appropriate, or non-offensive. why, because we all have opposing view points on what is right and wrong. Religion is brought into this as well. I as one person @MONTH1 say that i am athiest, take that book off of this shelf, yet that is not the right thing to do.             Magazines can become a little racy at times. Such as @CAPS1, or @PERSON1. These magazines are not taken off shelves, yet they are offensive to some people. So why should they be taken off the shelvs for being a little racy, or a differant religion that what you believe is right? They should not be, and are not taken off the shelves because only a small percentage of people believe those magazines to be offensive to them or their religion.          Movies are always varied: horror, comedy, drama, ext..  These movies have ratings, which allow certain age groups to view them. This prevents young children to see the movie if it is offensive to them. Again religion is part of this, if a movie is to christian,an athiest., can say they do not like it. If the movie is wrong doing god, a christian person will not like it.               All of these books, magazines, and movies have one thing in common. If one or more people do not like them, they do not have to go see that movie, read that book, or magazine. you have that right as a citizen, to watch what you want, and to read what you like. They should not be taken off the shelves, or not able to be seen in theaters, if some people think it is offfensive.  Because that is a group of people that does not approve, not everyone"	7040	7041
5010	2	"My views on censorship in libraries. In libraries there is alot of stuf to look at such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Alot of theat stuff can be ofensive to some people. Posative views on censorship in libraries.     My posative views on censorship in libraries. I think that some of the bad stuff at the libraries teach you what not not to do. They should just keep the libraries the way they are. They should have adult areas in libraries.    Adult areas in libraries is a great idea. They need to have an adult area in libraries. The adult areas would contain books, magazines, movies, and music not suted for kids. Yes they do have adult areas but they dont try to keep kids out of them.     I dont think some material should be taken off the shelves. Adults like to go to the libraries top check out books, movies, magazines, and movies. If they take certain materials off they shelf kids today wouldnt learn whats wrong or write. I dont think they should take some material off the shelves at libraries.     In conclusion i dont think that they shouls take censored stuff off the shevels at libraries. If there is offensive stuff on the shelevs you should have not read them. You dont have to read every book in the library juat the ones you want to read. They should not take books, magazines, movies, or music off the shelves."	7042	7043
5011	2	"Many times I have gone to the book store or library and have seen book, magazines, movies, edc., that I am just shocked that someone would even write. I look around to see if anyone else around me looks as disgusted as I do, and believe it or not no one else really seems to notice.      My view and concern is that @CAPS1 type of books or movies should not be on the shelves of a regular store or library. My concern is that they are offensive to some people and should not be displayed all over the public because the fact that children can see them.     There are thousands of people in prisons  all over the @LOCATION1 for child malesting and other things, and people do not understand where censorship in libraries has an effect on this. I strongly believe that the open display if porn and nudity have an effect on how many people we have in our prisons today.     I have many times picked up a book that i thought had an interesting title, and then was shocked be the horrible content it had inside. I thinl to myself, ' I am horrified by what is in this book, but what would a younger child think if they were to pick up this book?' I realize that a young child who has never seen censorship, @MONTH1 be really upset if they were to pick up a book and see the awful content.     My opinion on this problem is that @CAPS1 books, magazines, movies, cd's ect., are okay to be sold, but only in adult stores. My opinion is also that adult store should be outside of town, instead of right in the middle of everything. I believe if they removed censorship in libraries, and put them in adult stores only, it would be much better for our community. Libraries are supposed to be a place where children can go study, find information, or enjoy reading a book. Parents should not have to worry about there children picking up a book containign things that there child has never seen before because, people insist that it is their right to have those things publicly displayed in libraries.      Many cd's have songs that talk about things like drugs, sexual activity, nudity, and violence, @CAPS1 things are not suitable for children and should also only be sold in adult stores.     I also believe that libraries should also block certain websites to make sure that the children who come to their library are safe. Parents should not have to worry about what their children might see when they go the library or if they go to certain sections of the labrary.       Censorship is found offensive not only to me, but to many parents and other people. I believe that as far as rating goes, anything rated over @NUM1 should be sold in adult stores only. Video games rated over @CAPS2, should also only be sold in adult stores.     It is proven that if a child plays a violent video game, alot of times it causes the child to become violent. Alot of people call it 'being sheltered' if  a parent will not allow their children to watch movies rated over @NUM1 or play video games rated over @CAPS2, but I call in 'being safe'. Mant parents choose not to allow certain movies or gsmes, because they do not want to expose their children to the display of drugs, violence or nudity.      I strongly believe in cenorship being offensive and agree that it should be banned from libraries and regular stores to make the @LOCATION1 a better place to live"	7044	7045
5012	2	"Options in a @CAPS1     You can't eat that cake. You can't buy those shoes.  Imagine being told what you can and cannot do.  Each and every person in the country has rights to do what they want; weather it be sky diving or dining at their favorite restaurant the options are open.       In today's society several things could be found offensive to groups of people or even individual people.  Often times we look at how a person feels about a particular situation rather than what they learn from it.  In our libraries, we are faced with several choices and options on what books to read or which movies we want to watch.  Everybody should have the right to make their own decision on what they want to expose themselves to.       The idea behind taking certain material off the shelf due to the effect it has on people is not a bad idea, but there is another way to approach the problem.  The best way to protect people while still giving them rights is to give people a warning for what they are getting into.  With that there could be a special section in the libraries devoted to those certain types of material.     Books and other types of media, although could be offensive or inappropriate, can be eduational.  Let's face the facts that most books could be found even the slightest bit offensive to somebody.  A person could read a book that has a character that reminds them of themself and that character could be bullied.  An @CAPS2 @CAPS3 could read a book about slavery that they find to be offensive.  Contraversal problems are everywhere but often times we do not see how it effects certain people.  The people reading the books that offend them help them realize what to look out for and how to face it in reality.  Although not everybody thinks that way, it could be helpful for some, and people who read the material are at least exposed to it.       It is possible for a little kid to pick out something from the @CAPS1 that is inappropriate for their age.  In this instance it is the parent's job to step in.  If the parent does not step in then it is likely that the child already knows the kinds of things they could find in the world anyway.  Some parents believe that it is best to keep their children completely isolated, in which case a the parent would be sure to make the child puts the book or magazine back on the shelf.       The thought of putting certain material in libraries in a dedicated section is to keep people away from things if they are easily offended.  This way everybody can get what they want: to choose what they want and to be warned.  The idea does not directly tell you not to read that book, but it shows a warning to all who need it"	7046	7047
5013	2	"So if every book was removed from the shelfs then what would our world come to?  If everything we knew as children was gone and nothing was here that was in our time that we had, what would everyone do?     Every kid at some point will: see, read, hear over their life time that you would think is bad but really is it just letting them know what happens later on in their life time.  I think that every kid should be able to read or watch also hear all of this stuff at a age that they have matured and know what it all means.     If everyone was with out these books or movies we wouldn't have any entirnament, without that we as a human race would be in chaos I think that if it was to come down to it there would be more wars, of even worse things could happen.  Aslo without books or some movies, music and some magazines how would our children or even ourselves remember about our pasts!?  Because with out that we wouldn't remember a thing of what we have done or what the whole world has done, it would be like starting a new.     But on the other side I myself can see that some things should be left un-seen till the person is old enough to understand it unlike a child watching a horrer film and being scared for life and worryed that it too could happen to him/her.  As it happend to one of my friends who watched a scary movie at the age of @NUM1, and he couldn't sleep, he would always come to school tired and scared, afterwards he would've just gone home and he never came out of this little thing till the age of @NUM2.  This is why something are just left un-seen but yet evey kid should have the chance to see, read, hear everything that we have.     So thats why I think nothing should be taken off book shelfs or any kind of shelfs, but I also think that there should be a age limit to what some of the kids should be able to see so that they won't grow up scared for their lives"	7048	7049
5014	2	"No not in the least. This country is based of freedom ans as @ORGANIZATION1 freedom is what we should expect, for example is the took books related to the form of government known as @CAPS1 or any related material to it such as the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 well I personally study government and military related actions in history so i would no longer be able to learn about any of those related topics. There should never be a restriction on knowledge in our nation. When countries control what topics can be studied or read about in a  @CAPS4 forum such as a librery then that is a sign of oppression and tyrinnical control of authority which leads to war and civil unrest and terrorism. That @MONTH1 seem like a streach of affect but the basic logic and point i am trying to make remains the same. Now of course some things should not be allowed to be seen in @CAPS4 forums but seeing how that already as safe guards in place its not a current issue. Then you get to things like 'my children shouldn't be exposed to books or anything related to terrorism, violence, firearms, or unwanted views pertaining to politics, government, and at time religion depending on ones belief system, but face it wether you like it or not this world and this country you live in is filled with war, terror, fear, violence, terroism, tyrinny, oppression, and terrible uncertainty. This is why knowledge on these topics can help bring light to these subjects and even protect you in many cases.      There are two kinds of people in the world wolves and sheep. Wolves are like a unit or a gang if you will, they are @ORGANIZATION1, strong, powerfull, protected, not messed with, intemedating, and smart. They lead as others follow. Now sheep stand aside and are fearfull, paranoid, alone, and followers. Sheep generally have problems with everything like what materials should been seen in libraries because they have nothing better to do and can try to fight that, while wolves are fighting in the army, in gangs, for the police, militans, and other such organizations. Do you wonder why those people don't have problems like 'whats in the library is bad for my kids.'? Its because they are fighting a real cause that affects lives not fighting futile pointless cases of annoyance. Strong people lead the way while the weak are nothing but annoyences to society. This @MONTH1 have seemed irrelevent to the case at hand but if you think about it its deffinatly related to the topic as well as the rest of the worlds issues.      Now actual concerned parents have a right to be worried don't get me wrong thats completly different the people who do nothing but cause issues. If nthey keep paying attention to yhier kids and keep them away from unwanted materials it'll be fine. There are designated sections for kids usual as well anyway. In conclusion no libraries are doing a great job so keep it up"	7050	7051
5015	2	"Hello my name is @CAPS1 and I hear that you are trying to suppress books that you find offensive. I'm here to tell you that that might not be the best idea. There are many reasons that this @MONTH1 not be the best idea to just get rid of any book you find offensive.          Censorship is thought to be a great idea right? Well I must admit it was a reasonable solution for @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies, but it's not the best solution for books. Children will always try to do the exact opposite of what you tell them to do. Thats why when you tell a child to not watch a scary movie that is on late at night they often end up laying in the bed with their parents because they are to scared to sleep. Thats why censorship is good for @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies, so you can just block the channels you do not want your child to watch.     Libraries however should not take books off the shelves just because someone @MONTH1 find them offensive. Other people @MONTH1 find the book or magizine to be a good read. Thats why they shouldn'@CAPS2 just take books off the shelves for certain people. A better idea than getting rid of the books is simply just to put ratings on them like they do for movies or games. This would set an age limit for the books that people @MONTH1 find 'offensive' but would allow the people that enjoy to read them to still have access to them. Kids would no longer be able to just pick up any of these offensive books from the library to borrow, which would help solve the problem of parents complaining that their kids are exposed to to many offensive books.      I believe that censorship is a good idea for somethings, such as @CAPS2.V. or movies. It is not a good idea to censor books and such in the libraries. I hope you take my idea of just putting ratings on books and magizines into consideration before you just take the books off the shelves"	7052	7053
5016	2	"Who decides to ban books? Is is our parents, teachers, or principals? Also, what makes a book be on the banned books list? Katherine Paterson, a famous author, states that '... if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone can decide that a book should be banned, then there would be none left! Certian books, movies, or magazines should not be removed because help people mature, show great examples of life and the hardness that comes from it, and entertain people.      As people decide to remove books, they @MONTH1 not take into account that these books might help build character. Books that might have some suggestive content can be troublesome for a young reader. However, these books should be allowed for him or her to read when he or @CAPS1 is ready. Parents should decide when their child is ready to read a book or watch a certain television show. If children are not ready to handle what those books or movies have to offer, then they should stay away from them.     Not only should a person be ready to handle a book's content, but they should also learn the hardness of life described in it. Even if a book contains poor language at times, the moral lesson @MONTH1 be worth learning. My dad is very protective over me and tries to keep me from movies with suggestive laguage and immoral behaviors. However, if he thinks I am able to learn from these movies, then I am allowed to watch them if I can apply them to my own life.     Although people can learn from ban books, some parents let their children read these books simply because they entertain the parents' children. Because of this, kids sometimes are corrupted at a young age. Therefore, a parent has to be sure that their child can handle whatever they give the child. I understand that sometimes parents just want to escape or take a break from their childen and just let them sit infront of the television. However, they still should monitor what their children watch.     Even though my dad closely watched what I read and what I watched, I respected his decision. Nevertheless, I am allowed to read the banned books that are required during school. Some example would include To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. Therefore, students should be able to read banned books if their parents think they are ready. These books, and also suggestive television shows, can help children mature and grow, teach life lessons, and also entertain children."	7054	7055
5017	2	"Should there be censorship in libraries? I have read many books, listened to music, and seen some, what you could call, inapropriate movies. Everyone has as well. But even so, just because one thing upsets another doesn't make that particular thing wrong. It is in my strongest opinion that there should not be censorship in libraries.     I understand deeply that some things can be offending to some people. Those particular people, though, aren't forced to entertain themselves with that material. If they don't like it, they can avoid it. Other people @MONTH1 enjoy that item that is offensive. It's their right to. Exactly as Katherine Paterson's quote says, if everyone destroyed what they didn't like, there would be nothing left.     I do have understanding in entertainment that speaks ill in certain cases such as race, religion, size, color, gender, and anything else that discriminates peoples' differences. I find those wrong, but, again, people can avoid it. I do think, though, that there should be warnings of some sort as to alert the people who dispise it. Just think, even if those things were censored, would that end discrimination? I doubt it.     Just the other day, I read a book that was given to me by a friend. She loved it; I did not. Even so, why should I deprive other people of it? Everyone has laughed at something that would affend others. There's no doubt about it. If we lived in a time where libraries and other things were censored, we would gain no knowledge from right or wrong. If everyone did the same, there would be no good. True, it's a complicated matter, but really, you must have bad in order to have good. Plus, you must have good in order to have bad. Otherwise, there would be no way to distinguish between the two.     Lastly, I'd like to say that libraries have a right to carry whatever they please. United @CAPS1 citizens were given the right to the freedom of speech. I figure that includes the libraries. Some things, such as the race and religion, I feel should be kept to personal thoughts and not out in the open. Nothing should be ever forced upon someone. I am in no position to make those changes, though, and this is only my opinion. It is merely my freedom of speech.     So, I do think that things shouldn't be censored. I know that people @MONTH1 not agree in the things that I'm saying, but that is their opinion. A freedom that was blessed upon us long ago. I don't mean to mock the people who feel something is wrong. I've felt the same way. I would never, though, stop someone from entertaining them selves with something that I find offensive. I don't need to get into their buisness and, like I have said before, I don't need to entertain myself with what I dislike."	7056	7057
5018	2	"I personally think that yeah every person has a certain book they would not want in a library for their children to read. But in a way, at the same time you have to look at it in another way, for example, if you would want your child to have a better future for themselves, let them study or read at a library what they want to learn. In a certain time in life every human being will have to learn about things in life.      I feel that in a library that could be done well. The library has books, videos, music, news, magazines, important things that we walk right past them without even knowing it, we never think to our selfs, 'oh maybe I can learn about something new in the world and keep in touch with whats happening around us,' we walk right past that stuff like as if it was nothing. We need to wake up and learn about the world and what happens in it.      Children need to be educated in order for them to have a good future and learn about those things we are leaving behind. We gotta stop at a library and atleast learn lttle by little. That way we know things and become better people in life. And have smarter brains, because that will help you and your children be smarter people.     So stop at a library and grab a book, sit down, and learn about life. The past, the present, and the future."	7058	7059
5019	2	"One lovely evening, I walked over to the library to get myself a nice book to read so I could relax at home.  As I was rummaging through the shelves I came across a book titled '@CAPS1 in @LOCATION2'.  I was very upset with the situation I just came across because to me @CAPS1 is too offensive it needs to be discussed about it so it isn't likely to happen in @LOCATION2 or any where else for that matter, but this book was entitled to enjoy @CAPS2 racist towards others and assume it's alright to do so.     During, my library outing I picked up the book and started to read the first couple pages while standing between the shelves.  I read two short pages and was so upset, and emotional over @CAPS1.  The first page read a short passage '@CAPS2 racist towards others is fun and should be allowed in the @LOCATION1'.  I immideatly went to the front desk and filed a complaint to the librarian.  She looked shocked and angry that I was filing a complaint to her library for the @CAPS1 book but I will not stand for this kind of disturbance.  As I looked at the librarian I appropiately looked at her and told her ' @CAPS3'm the book I'm holding is disturbing and should not be held in this library for young children to see or even adults simply because it approaches @CAPS1 is okay for children and if they read this book they would get the wrong impression and @MONTH1 start joining in on it to their classmates in school, or others in public they @MONTH1 see'. The librarian ended up @CAPS2 very quiet and appauled as well to see that this book had landed up in her library and is under her responsibility.     She then said quietly ' I'm sorry sweetie, let me take the book out of your hands and while you go look for another one to enjoy I will be taking your complaint to the office and putting the book in the banned area in storage'.  I smiled at her and said thank you very much I'm glad you understand where I am coming from.  My point is to reach out to others and let them see @CAPS1 is not right in any way shape or form, thats why the @CAPS4 even stated it years ago.       Since, @CAPS2 an older sister to two young siblings that will be willing to read in just a few years, I wouldn't want them to walk  into their library and pick up a @CAPS1 book and think it's alright for them to see and read.  @CAPS1 causes many fights, struggles and emotional distress on others.  I also come from a family with people that are a different race than me and friends that I love @CAPS2 around each and every day.  When I see them, I treat them just like their one of me because it's true your color doesn't make you who you are it's what's inside of you and your personality.      If you see anyone @CAPS2 bullied about their race take it up with a councelor or parent or just simply pull them aside and be their friend, that is truly what everyone needs in this world. A great friend that they can lean on when the going gets rough. For the library each time you go, go to a section and look for any  appropiate books, because for me just looking one by one I found one that could have changed a lot of people and by taking it up with the librarian it was banned from the library and she even made her employees help her find anymore bad ones for the children and put them in banned storage.       I believe I changed a lot of people that day because I took a risk and made a difference in someones life by taking @CAPS1 in this world seriously because it is very wrong in every way and should never be labeled on anybody because of their color their just human and the same as you & I."	7060	7061
5020	2	"Everybody has different oppinions and they are entitled to that opinion. Just because you think somebody's idea is stupid doesn't mean that you can throw it away. '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a book writen by @CAPS3 about @CAPS3's life. I do not agree with anything he says in the book, but I dont think it should by taken off the shelf. If everybody took a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then there would be no more books on the shelf.      If you take a book off the shelf that tells a teen what you don't think they should read, then you are just making it so theat they will want to read it more. Teenagers are extremely curious and love forrbiden stuff. The more an adult forrbides a teenager the more a teenager is going to want to do it. If you tell a teenager to not do something, then as soon as you look away the teenager will do what you said not to do. The internet is a backdoor that teenagers use to get around thier parents. They could just go online and look up the book.      Another reason why you should not censor books in a library is that a teenager or child will never learn of the evilness or badness in the world and will be naive. If the person, does not see both sides of an argueement then they will forever by one sided and ignorant. They will never get a look at the real world.     Taking a book off the book shelf is like taking away somebody's right to free speach. Its like somebody entering your office and destroying your paper. You can no longer voice your oppinions and no longer show the truth. Taking a book off the book shelf is not the right way to go about censoring the book. If a child or teen reads the book you should talk to them and tell them your oppinion if you really want to be heard.      If you take a book off a book shelf, then you are taking somebody's words and ripping them up. To take someone's voice away is the same as taking thier identity away. Without identity humans are worth nothing. It doesn't matter who's identity is loss no one should have to go through a loss of identity. It doesn't matter who wrote the book or what its about the author has a right to express his or her oppinion"	7062	7063
5021	2	"Books, Music, Movies, Magazines, etc., @CAPS1 do these things have in common?  These useful materials all have ratings on them wheter it be kid rated or teen rated or even an adult rating.  These ratings can mean different things.  The first problem with these ratings are that, any person no matter @CAPS1 age, can purchace and either read or watch these materials.  This poses a huge problem in our society today.  In my opinion these entertainment materials should not be taken of the shelves but that they should be supervised more closely.     I believe that these things that we call entertainment can harm the younger kids.  I believe that we should seperate these adult rated films, books, and magazines from those teen rated materials.  Along with this, both the adult and teen rated entertainment should be seperated from young children rated films.  Reasoning for this would be that the younger generations are being taught harmful things from a younger age and are being taught that these things are allowed.       Another reason for my opinion would be that these adult rated films are scarring our future of the @LOCATION1.  When I was growing up I was always taught not to curse not to lie and not to cheat.  Now days children that read these books and watch these movies are being exposed to the real world before they can handle the consequences.  This poses a huge problem because there is an ever growing number of children and when they are taught these bad habits the world gets harder and harder to live in because of the violence and other things that are portrayed to be alright.       In your community would you rather have a generation of kids who use profanity often?  Or would you rather have a generation of kids who learned from there books or movies and used them towards making the world better?  But you would say wouldnt you rather have your kids learn these bad habits early and let them make the decision to stop them!  I say no.  The reason for this is because of the likelihood that the children dont give up their habits and act the opposite of @CAPS1 they should be acting like.       Censoring the libraries have a positive and a negative outcome, I chose the safer path of which was the middle.  As I stated before I would rather the entertainment materials to be seperated by rating wheter it be kid watchable, teen watchable, and adult watchable.  But with these seperations I think they should be supervised more carefully so that younger kids aren't as easily exposed to the profanity and other major obstacles of life"	7064	7065
5022	2	"In some cases, I believe that censorship is completely necessary. TV, video games, and radio should all be censored because it, in most cases, prevents younger audiences from seeing and hearing things that are beyond their age. However, when it comes to censoring books, I absolutely abhorr it. For as long as I can remember, books have been a large part of my life, comforting me when I was sad, angry or lonely. Beautifully spun tales of romance, adventures and tragedies saved me from a world that was hard at times. I have always read at a higher level than most of my peers, and craving books that challenged my mind I turned to books that were a little less childlike. At a young age, I had read about many topics that my parents were too afraid of discussing with me. But through that, I was exposed to deeper issues than just finding the treasure or making it through a rough day. By reading, I was able to emotionally connect to a character and seeing things through their eyes. Much of what I've learned about life has come from reading. And to think of people trying to prevent children from falling in love with the sames stories I did breaks my heart. There are so many things that a child takes away from a book and learns from a book cannot even be compared to learning from school or parents. Having a connection to these stories is truly astounding.Of course, I understand why teachers and parents would want to keep children away from controversial topics. Some things are just not appropriate for a child to read. No adult in their right mind would hand an eight year old a book about sex, drugs or alcohol. But overall, I believe that no person has the right to say that a child cannot read a book because it has foul language or violence or anything else. Because who knows what that child @MONTH1 learn from that boo"	7066	7067
5023	2	"Hi, have you ever felt as if you were being disrespected mentally instead of verbally. Well thats how I feel at times when I read certain books that are are published and displayed.         There are certain books that express a certain religion and that religion @MONTH1 not be the one I pursue in my life. Although the book is telling me that  the religion I adore is not the right one, according to them and god. Which makes me  say I want to do right by god so to do so im going to have to change my ways.          In the process of doing so, I keep reading the book which  is telling me certains ways I should live my life when I'm actualli saved. As in going to chruch everyday of the week, fasting, behaving right, and just being pure in all of gods ways.          If i haven't been doing all of those things, it makes me feeel as if im in the worng all of the time like nothing I have ever did was good with god. which affends me in a big way, because if I have been living my life without all of those rules and suggestions. I feel as if i have been commiting a life full of sinery. So thats why I feel that books can be sometimes offensive"	7068	7069
5024	2	"I believe that books, magazines, etc. that are found offensive should not be taken off of the library shelves. One way or another somebody will find something offensive. People have to learn to not be so sensitive. I could see if the magazine was very racist or sexest, or if it was pornogrophy, but if it is a simple book on black history, then it should be left alone. I believe that if everyone took down  @NUM1 books that they found offensive, or even just one, then there would be no more books in ANY library in the @LOCATION1.      Also I believe that libraries should have a stricter policy on what they let get checked out. People steal books on a regular basis from the library. I personally know alot of people who steal. I think that books that have dorogatory words that are in the school's library should definately be removed. Who wants to hear their child cursing, and when you ask they say they got it from a book at the school library? I dont know about you but that would really anger me. The libraries should have a whole team of people to thouroughly review the books, magazines, movies, etc. that come through their doors.      Yet it is good that they have things sorted into organized sections. That makes it alot easier to tell your children which books to avoid. Me being a teenager, I usually gravitate to the young adult books. They are what interest me most of the time. Sometimes I'll venture into the adult section for a certain book, but that is only sometimes. School libraries should only have school oriented books. Research books are a good idea. In the younger schools they should only have the cartoon books with the little educational messeges in them.      More and more people are flocking to the internet these days. People see no need for libraries if they have a computer at home. So more and more the library is becoming obsolete. I personally use my computer much more than I go to the library.                     So in closing i would like to say that no, offensive books should not be taken down from shelves. People should just learn to steer away from it or get over it."	7070	7071
5025	2	"Well first of all, i don't think that books that are offensive should'nt be on the shevles of libraries, because people enjoy reading books all type of books. I really enjoy reading interesting books. But everyone has there own why of likeing things."	7072	7073
5026	2	"Yes i do believe that books that are found offensive to people should not be on some shelves.  Some books should just not be on the shelves where kids or minors can read them.  In some cases poeple are very different and like different kinds of books.     In the case of @ORGANIZATION1, my parents did not allow me to read those books because they had referenced to the devil.As you grow older and more mature you can read books that swear or have references to different kinds of things, that little kids should not know or hear about.     I believe that books for older people or mature people should be in a different section of the library.  Those books should be far away from where the kids look for there books, and if parents let there children read books that are offensive to some people then they can take there children to the seperate section of the library and have them get a book.     In conclusion, there are many views and aspects to this contriversy over books in librarys.  If books that people dont want to read arents there then where are they going to go to gets those books"	7074	7075
5027	2	"In my oppinion it just depends on the case.  Everyone has their own emotions, and opinions on what should be done. They can choose rather they want to read it or not read it, but just because they don't like it or take offence to it doesn't mean they have to take it off the shelf for other people ot to be interested in it.  Honestly if every person went and took just one book off of the shelf because they were offended by it, there wouldn't be any more books for any one to read.           Us having zero books would be a very horrible thing.  I mean how would we learn about religions and cultures if people just take offence from the books. We learn from not just what is around us but what also comes from our books.  They are a very important object in life.  Everyone uses them rather they mean to or not.  Instruction manuels for exsistence not everyone likes them but we still need them, so just because that one person didn't like using it and desided to take it off the shelf. Would it be fair to have to just try to put everything together with out any help? No it would be fair at all; just really hard to put together.     Music is my life honestly, but I do agree that some music is very interpropriate for younger children to process and hear. Volgure language about sex, drugs, and other things should not be in the librarys for just anyone to be able to check out. Children now a days follow there music hero and if all they hear is bad language; sex talk and drug usage then they are more prone to do it also.     With movies it mainly depends on what it is rated or what the movie is about. If it is about sex and or anything else inapropriate and or if it is raited @CAPS1 then people no younger than @NUM1 should be able to rent it with out a parents concent before hand.  Just to make sure they aren't getting them selves into trouble and seeing stuff that is not appropriate for their age group.     Magazines are sometimes very interesting but often lie. I personally only look at very few magazines, they can be interstingn sometimes but ca also be very boring!  That is only my opinion for them though. They just don't seem to interest me. Other people by chance love them. I say as log as they don't have nudeity in them they should be absolutely fine.      Overall I do not think it would be a good idea for everyone to just take a book off the shelf for offesive reasons.  They should keep it on even though it could be offensive."	7076	7077
5028	2	"Censorship in Libraries                                   @CAPS1: @ORGANIZATION1 in libraries is most likely a common issue in all public libraries. Books, movies, music or magazines could effect colors based on racism, violence, or other issues that people have. Some people have different beliefs or concerns about what should be put in libraries. I believe the reason why libraries have certain books is for some people like to learn about topics or different kinds of history.          I believe that movies, books, or anything other kind of resource in a library should be allowed to be in there. I know that most libraries have different sections for types of books like fiction and non-fiction. I think that in all libraries, there should be certain sections for movies, music, books, magazines and more. I understand that some people have issues with what is in libraries. For instant, some parents think that movies that contain vugar images or have violence in them should not be in the library. I think that the library should have everything, some people like to rent movies to see action and other things. I do think that nude images on a movie should be put on a higher shelf or in a different section just for grown ups, but other than that I think everything should be put in libraries.      The library is a resource to learn more about anything that you would like to learn about. Libraries have different types of books, mostly anything you would like to learn or read about is at the library. At libraries in schools, they usually do not have movies or vugar books. In schools, the librarian still has books and magazines. Libraries have books about times in the past, novels, short stories, poems, and much more. The library is a place to learn new information or just to research a topic for a school project. Usually when people go to the library and check a novel or short story out, they just want to enjoy a good book.      In my own experience, my mother and I went to the public library in @LOCATION1 to rent a few movies. My mom told me to go pick out a couple movies, so I went over @CAPS1 the movie section and just grabbed a movie that look descent and went over to my mom to give it to her. She took the movie and read the back of it and said that it looked like a good movie. We rented it and took it back home. At home, I was excited to see a new movie, so we started to watch it immediately. The movie was going great and it was really funny. About the middle of the movie, it started to get very vugar. Luckily, I was mature and took the movie out, I did not want to watch it anymore.      I think that even though a movie does not say that it has rated @CAPS2, does not mean it doesn't have vugar images in it. I know that I have seen images and read things that I did not want to, but I still think that libraries should have the freedom to have what they would like in their libraries. I do admitt that librarian's should have movies and books sorted better for the benefit of children. Other topics about the library could be that people do not want to see certain colors of people, but I think the should just grow up and go on with life. Black people and white people are living together and are civil.      I believe that censorship is common in libraries. Books, movies and resources in libraries do have things like violence, racism, and vugar images in them. A library has all of these types of things because some people like to watch and learn about certain things. A lot of people do have their opinions of what should be in the libraries, mostly parents, they would like their children to go to the library to learn and research what they like and not be seeing things that they should not. I believe that the reason why libraries have certain is for the people who like to learn about different topics or history. I would like to thank you for letting me write my concerns and opinions"	7078	7079
5029	2	"Today i will be writting a perssuasive essay about books. music, magazine. if these materials should be removed out of shelf if found offensive.      If i whent to the library and and i found a book or magzines that i felt i like that was really offensive i would just read the tittle and scame trough it and see what they have on their but i would still want the library to get rid off the book because i felt like it was offensive even if they might think the same we all have our different thoughs.          In this essay i talk about what would i do if i whent to a library and i seen a book, magazine etc.. offensive what whould?"	7080	7081
5030	2	"Do I believe certain materials such as, books, or magazines, should be removed from shelves due to it being offensive to a person. My opinion is that it should not be removed. If one person does not like the piece of information, then that is their opinion and no one elses. Someones opinion should be considered as why it should be on the shelves, not why it is based off of ones opinion. One persons opinion can destroy another persons ideas.     First, most pieces of information that are published and distributed to its customers, have vital pieces that come together in the end. What I'm trying to say is you have to read or watch the piece to get the whole book or movie. You can't judge it by the beginning. You have to review the whole thing and discuss it with others before you can criticize or promote the piece of information. Some kids I know judge the pictures of a book, without even reading it.      Second, others @MONTH1 have an opinion on it based on their religion. I know that my friends and I are not fond of the, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' We believe that @CAPS4 created the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS5, not science. It is hard to learn something that you do not believe in. But, non-believers do believe in this @CAPS3. You cannot say a piece of information is offensive to someone else unless you really know they do, because we all have our own opinions.      And third but not last, the movie, '@DATE1', offended me. It tried to persuade me into thinking that the world will end next year, on @DATE1 at @NUM1 in the @TIME1. That upset me, but I was not going to spoil it for the whole bunch of people who might have liked it. I know it got great reviews and such. But, I will base my opinion on it from the words of the @CAPS6.      Finally, if I found something offensive about a piece of knowledge, I would not like it. But, I also would not ruin it for the people who enjoyed it. One rotten egg can spoil the whole dozen. I am just saying this because this would be similar to I ruining the end of a book cause I didn't like it. If you don't like it, don't cry about it, just move on."	7082	7083
5031	2	"In todays libraries, there are many other types of materials other than just books you can view and check out at your command. Some of these include magazines, movies/dvds, and even music. Not all the materials are what you would call 'g' rated, some materials are just not ok for kids that are young to read and observe. I think these materials shouldn't be allowed to be seen and read by minors but, still avalible for your mature responsible adult.     Taking out the offensive materials in a library for the youth would be good, but not for the mature people the materials were written for and are suppossed to be enjoyed by. I think by putting a rating system on all the materials in the library could help for even finding want material you are really looking for. Only allowing people over a certain age to check out certain material rated for that age group.      Like for movies the rating system used to warn the viewers that whats in the movie could offend or have offending acts in them, could be used by libraries, putting certain books, magazines, and music in a certain section in the library for mature viewers.     From my own trials going to the library checking out a book and finding that it has many curse words and demoralizing acts in them, is a problem because a young kids could had checked out the same book and been soaking up the bad things in the book. This is why i think the books and other materials at the library should be sectioned off depending on rating, alright to view by an older user .     Anything someone puts the time into writing, directing, or producing I think should be allowed at a public library, because it is intended for someone but not all people. If the material in offensive it should have its own area in library for those who are mature enough to handle the information with fore warning. The public library is for all people and age groups, and should be allowed to display all materials just in the right way to the right people."	7084	7085
5032	2	"In the world there are things that we find offensive to ourselves and the people around us. Many of them are movies, music, magazines, and books. These examples are created off human experiences and tell things that really happened in someone's life. However, people think these sort of things should be removed from the television, radio, and shelves, so that we are not allowed to see them. The reality is, in the real world you do not get censored from bad things and to prepare kids for life after high school, we should require them to see nudity, violence, and cursing in school.      There are things in movies, books, magazines, and music  you @MONTH1 not find offesive but there is someone out there who does. If you wanted to take away a book that you thought was offensive, then you would be taking away a book that someone else thought wasn't offensive. 'You also have the exact same right and so does someone else. And then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' said Katherine Paterson. Her and I both think every book out in the world is going to be offensive to someone, so if we let someone take away any book they find obsurd then there will be no books to read, and kids will be frightened when they reach the real world and see that bad things do exist.      I think this topic is a lot like kids who are very sheltered by there parents when they are growing up. Kids that can not hang out with friends, go to social events, and can't read or watch some offensive things are at a major disadvantage later in life. I feel that they have a lot to learn when they move out of the house. I think kids should be required to read or see an offensive piece of material. I believe this because if a child has never heard a curse word or see an offensive picture, the first time they see one when they are older, they will freak out and not know what to do. However, if people wouldn't have taken it off the shelf, the child would have seen or read it, and they would know how to handle the situation because of prior knowledge.     In my own experiences, readings,and watchings, I have seen, heard, and read some offesnive things. I think that a lot of factors have played into me seeing and reading different types of material at a semi- young age. Part of it is that I have gone to public school all of my life and you are exposed to many different views at a school that is public. Many kids use curse words in every sentence and as you walk down the hallways, you hear those words. Also in a public school the teacher's are more laid back on the things we see and read. An example is in eighth grade, my @CAPS1 class watched a movie that showed naked women in it. Last year in @CAPS1 class, we read a book that used the @CAPS3- word on every-other page. The other factor is my parents and what they let me see and read. In elementary school they were very scrict on the things that I watched. I never saw a bad movie at that young of an age. In middle and high school, they have backed off a lot and allow me to watch almost anything that peaks my interest. They know the things that happen in adult life and they know the things I will see and read, and they want me to know and learn about these things before I get to college.         In the real world there are many things we find offensive to ourselves and the people around us. Books, movies, music, and magazines are based off human experinces and tell things that happen in someone's life. People think that these things should be removed from shelves, so kids can not see them. The truth is, the real world isn't censored and to prepare kids for the life after education, we need to allow them to see things life nudity, cursing, and violence in school"	7086	7087
5033	2	"Not everyone has the same taste in books, movies, music, and so forth. I don't believe that any person or group of people should decide what is available to me. I want to make my own choices. I don't need somone to do it for me. I know what to watch, read or listen to. Do you think anyone should be able to censorship movies, books, movies ect.?     Some teens might like rap, or hip hop music, alot of parents and older adults don't like it because they talk about sex, and drugs. Everybody has different taste in music, that's why there are different types. If people would ban music that wouldn't be fair for me or the people who like my music I like or different music. Music is a big part of life to me and alot of people in this world. So in my opinion music shouldn't be banned just because one person doesn't like the music. Due to some peole's objections, it doesn't mean everyone else should suffer.     Do you think certain books should be in the library? I do, but I don't think they should be banned everywhere. There should be age appropriate books. I don't think they should have porn in libraries or where any kid can get ahold of it. I don't think they should ban porn just there should be different places for different things.     I don't think they should ban any movies. If it's rated @CAPS1 then you know that a kid shouldn't be watching it. That's why they have the ratings. I think you don't have to worry about movies because theyre age rated. If your not old enough you can't watch it, you can't get in without a parent. Some people think it's bad to watch rated @CAPS1 movies, but everyone is differnt one person shouldn't stop others from watching it just because someone doesn't like it. That's why there's not just rated @CAPS1 or teen movies. The rating scale will help you decide if you want to watch it.     So, it all comes down to what you like and what you don't like. Why should everybody suffer and have to listen, read, watch what one person likes? Everybody is different in every way, and has different tastes. It wouldn't be fair for anybody to conroll another person choice. Would you like if someone banned something you like alot? Everyone would be affected in baning music, movies, books ect. Let each person decide what they want to read, listen to or watch. We should be able to make our own choices."	7088	7089
5034	2	"I do not think items such as these should be removed from the shelves. I think this first and for most because what these item contain is more or less someones personal opinon on a surton topic. Also some people only get offended because they cant see someones elses point of veiw. Finaly people write what they want to, they have the right to say what they feel.     The books, news papers, music, movies, etc., contain peoples opinon on surton topics. They only want to express what they feel or what they think they know in the movies or music they write. They share their opinon with the public for those who agree with them. Some music artist think its okay to hit a woman so they put it in a song. Its their opinon let them have it.     The people that get offended at the things writen now a day can't see a nothers point of veiw or don't understand it. They are set in their ways. Its all they've ever known. They don't except change so they try to make everyone else change to fit their opinon.     Lastly people write what they want to, not to impress people. Its just what the feel. If you don't like it or don't agree, then don't listen, read, or watch if it offends you. Just dont tell them they can't write their opinon its their right to. Just like you have a right to judge their work.     These are the reasons why I think surton items should'nt be taken form store shelves. Its the writters personal opinon and they are intitaled to it. People cant see their point of view so the get offended. Lastly peopel have a righ tto say what they feel and what they want to write. So don't get worked up about what they say or do."	7090	7091
5035	2	"Have you ever felt offended by a book, @CAPS1, or movie that you got from your local library? I dont believe there should be any books on the shelves at any library if you find them offensive.           People dont want to go to the library to get a book that is going to bring them down mentally. Most people that go to the library are looking for a book to read so they can enjoy themselves. I know that i wouldnt go to the library to get a book that i kow is going to make me feel bad about myself. When i go to the library i am looking for a book that i know will relax my mind and take my mind off things. Not a book that will make me feel bad and put me in a bad mood.      Offensive books are not knowledgable. If you think about it, your not going to go the library looking for a knowledgable book about something and come out with a book that is going to end up offending you in some way.     There are many things in a book that make the question if it is offensive or not. Some books for example, have pictures in them. An offensive book is bad for you but yet its good in a way. Being offended is a part of life, and if you have to learn that from reading a book. So be it.      There are many life lessons tought in offensive books but not all are tought so smoothly. Sometimes, you need to get over the things that offend you. The only way that will happen is by facing the things that offend you. Facing the things that offend you in a book, is not the way to handle it. You need to face them with yourself.     But yet, some books in the library are wonderful. Some are pleasing books that you want to read. Everybody has their own opinion on books and subjects of the books.      I think one of the first things you need to do before checking out a book is read the front cover. See what the book is about. Dont judge a book off its cover. Actually get to know what the book is based on. Ways you can do that is, read the front page or even look the book up online at the library you are at. There are many ways to find a book that interest you. You just need to know how.      Now you know my thoughts on the censorship in libraries. Now you put thought into what you think about some of the books on the shelves of your local library"	7092	7093
5036	2	"Dear censorship in libraries, there are some things you need to know. It's about how the library wants to remove certain books from the shelfs if they are found offensive. They want to remove books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. That is found offensive in everyway. What I want to do is to tell you different reasons why they shouldn't do this.      First, why remove certains books that are offensive. Isn't this the reason why we choose books and read them. So we can relate to books that are similar to us, and find books that is interesting. Also every person has a different opinion then others. One person might be interested in books that are offensive. The second person might not be to interested in the offensive books. So there for, that person can walk away and doesn't have to read them. If you give a book a bad comment and you havn't even read it. You're a loser, because you don't judge a book by its cover. If you have not read it, simple as that.      Second, when removing certain materials as in music and movies from a library. The rating of your library will definitely go down. Why? Is because, teenagers and adults love music and movies. Especially music and movies that are offensive in some ways. Some teenagers love this type of music because it makes them feel different then the other crowd. For example, hardcore rock music can be very offensive. This type of music is way different then other music. So what I'm trying to say, why remove something. That's making your rating go up. Also adults love movies that are offensive in some ways too. These types of movies are probaly comedy movies, because comedy movies can talk about anything. The comedian will make that offensive topic funny, then harmful. This is why, I don't believe the library should remove music and movies that are offensive, because there's a lot of @CAPS1 that can relate to those materials.      Third and finally, the magazines can sometimes be offensive. Maybe all the time depends on whoever the owner is. Why do I think this? Is because in different magazines such as '@CAPS1' and '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. They talk about a lot of celebraties in a offensive way or they will talk about them in a good way. They do this so they can keep their rating up. @CAPS1 all over the country are into magazines that talk about celebraties and how they are doing with their everyday @CAPS2 @CAPS3. These magazine are very offensive, because they talk about celebraties personal stuff and personal problems. I don't think they need to do that, and that's why I agree on removing this kind of material out of the library.      When removing certain books out of a library. I think every owner needs to know what will happened if they proceed on doing something like that. If they wonder why their rating went down, and why @CAPS1 don't show up anymore to checkout books, and etc. It's because the certain books you guys removed. Were probably one of the reason why you guys had a high rating then others, and now everything is all coming back on you. I think in the end, there will always be different type of @CAPS1 that will like this category more then this one"	7094	7095
5037	2	"Certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, and others things can be taken offensively. But is it the job of others to keep people away from that? Should adults, other than the parents of a child, worry about keeping children from listening and reading offensive or vulgar things that are kept in a library?      Parents worry about what their own children read and listen to but, as much as a parent tries to keep their child away, chances are they will experience vulgar and offensive things. Maybe they'll read it in a book, or hear these things from song lyrics that are played on the radio, or they could even hear things from their peers. But, at some point they will be exposed to the vulgar and offensive aspects of life. It is the parents job to teach the child that these things are wrong and they shouldn't listen or read or repeat these things.     However, i don't think that writers should have to censor vulgar or offensive things out of books, music or magazines. It's the readers or listeners choice what they read and how they take it. Also, who's to say what's offensive and what isn't? I'm sure that one person could take someting in an offensive way but, another person could take it a completely non-offensive way; it depends on the person.     For example, some comedians use racial jokes in their comedy routine. Maybe an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and a @CAPS3 go to the comedians show together not knowing the content in the comedians jokes. They get to the show and the crowd is very diverse so, neither of them feel out of place. But, when the comedian starts making jokes about @CAPS1 @CAPS5, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 gets offended but the white man that went with him doesn't see anything wrong with the comedians jokes. This sceanario shows that different races consider different things offensive.     In conclusion, i do not think that writers should have to censor things that could be taken offensivley. Let the reader decide if the text is offensive or let the listener decide if the lyrics are vulgar and inappropriate. Who's to say whats inappropriate, vulgar, or offensive? The reader or listener has the right to decide for himself and his own offspring"	7096	7097
5038	2	"If people would like to find a certain book or magazine, where do they go? The library. When I heard that books were being taken off the shelves because it was '... a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelves.', i was confused. I didn't know why they would refuse to have that book even for someone that it would be appropriate for.      Everyone has the right to look through or check out a book if they are wanting to do so. It is their choice on whether they pick it up off the shelf or not. Therefore, for one to say that books should be removed from the libray because it offends a small portion of the people who go to the there is absurd. Quite frankly I think that many more of the questionable novels and magazines should be included in the library for the people that are not offended and that would like to read them. But I do understand that there are some books that people, mainly children, that should not look at the book, but that does not mean that the books should be taken off of the shelves, away from everyone.     I think that there is a perfectly reasonable way to solve this problem. If the library was to make a section of these seleted books, movies,magazines, and others, the problem of children getting into these so called 'not child apropriate' books would be solved."	7098	7099
5039	2	i belive that one way to solve the problem is to have the books split up into sesions so that if someone finds a sertian book topic or wording to be offinsive they just could skip over it. and then if they have a problem with another book they can just tell the librian about the personing behind it and the libriana can do what they thin is right. then every one is happy because the people who want to read thos certan books they are still there.      then the other people who might not find the books offinsive they might get offinded by their book being seperated from the rest. so it gos both ways. but in my opinion if that person finds a book to be offinsive then they just dont half to reed it.         but this should all be up the librarian because they are the ones who half to put up with all the people geting the books. if they think a certan book should be pulled off the shelf and put in the back than so be it if the costomer wants to reed that book they can just take five secons out of their life to ask kindly for it from the librian.     i know when i find a book ofinsive i still have respet for the individual who has put their time on wrighting the book. i know that because they sat there and put thouht into it that there must be alot of people out there who love the book.     so i think that just because one person wants it off the shelf dosnt mean that one hundered want it gone. so my thoughts on it is that the librarn has the final say. but i say leve the librarys alone they are fine as they are.	7100	7101
5040	2	"some people think its ok to take certain books off the shelf so kids dont see it. in my opinion that shouldnt be allowed. kids have the right to check out any book they want, and if you dont want them to see it, then dont put it there in the first place.    Books, music, movies and other material shouldn't be removed if its offensive. most kids have probably heard most of the things in them anyways.    they should be kept in a certain area of the library so littles kids don't get into them, maybe put things that are considered offensive in a different room, separating from all the other material.    This is how i feel about censorship in libraries, my opinon @MONTH1 be different from other poeples but i feel strongly about this and that is why im writing to u about this"	7102	7103
5041	2	"To whom ever this @MONTH1 concern,     I would like to voice my opinion to this newspaper saying that I do not believe that any book, movie, magazine, or anything else of that material should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.  I know that you are probably wondering why would I not want to remove those certain things, and it is simply because there could be almost anything out there in the world that would offend somebody in some way.     Whether it be 'blacks', talking about slavery, 'whites', talking about how ignorant they are, 'gays', saying whether it is right or wrong, or 'religion', believing that @CAPS1 is better than @CAPS2. Any of these topics is offensive to at least one person out there.  Since we have all of these people that are being offended there will be all those materials removed.  When this is happening there will litterally be nothing left on the shelves!       If this were to happen, when kids or adults come in to rent a book about slavery, or a movie on gays, or even a magazine about @CAPS1, it would not be there.  Kids who are in school, such as myself, need to rent books from the library to research about a topic for an essay.  We research things of all sorts.  I can absolutely see how some of our topics to research could be a bit offensive, but that is not going to stop the teacher from assigning that certain topic.  If I am needing a big novel on a subject, and it is not in there because it's offensive to my neighbor down the street, and it gets removed, how am I going to find my information?  The answer is simple. I would not be able to.  Why should I have to suffer a good grade when one person gets offended by a book that he would probably never have to see anyways?  I should not have to.        I know that it is wrong to offend somebody, but if you think about it we all get offended at least once in our life.  It is a part of life and we just have to deal with it.  By taking the book, magazines, and movies away it is not solving anything.  It is just simply burrying the problem, its not making it go away.  This is why I think that the idea of removing books, magazines, movies, ect., is a not well thought out plan.  We shall keep all of the materials on the shelves for anybody to have access to, because you never know why anybody @MONTH1 need it.     Thank you,                     @LOCATION1"	7104	7105
5042	2	"There is an incredible amount of books to chose from in every library. The genres and choices are practically unlimited. From science fiction and fantasy to autobiographies and novels, the different types of genres go on and on. You could chose a brightly colored pop-up book or a @NUM1-inch thick, dust-covered encyclopedia. Some books have happy and positive endings while others could be very degenerative. Should those types of negative and degrating books be allowed to sit on a library shelf?     Books that have demonic ideas, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, should not be allowed on shelves. It speaks of nothing but evil and awful things about the @CAPS3 race. A melancholy book such as this does nothing but pollute and distort the person's brain.      Libraries also supply books that have a spirtial sense or aspect within their covers. Is imposing a religion on a reader a bad idea? These types of books will, if anything, help your aspect on life. They can give a positive attitude that could change the way you view or live your life.      Age limitations could be a new and inventive way to protect a child's eyes from reading anything that @MONTH1 harm them. For instince, a child should not be engulfed in a book that has explict language. Sex and violence should be on the list of what a child should not be able to read.      Ultimately, books of all genres, ideas, and messages should be allowed on shelves. It is the reader's choice whether to pick up a book and dive in or glance at it and move on. Parents should monitor what their child is reading for thier own safety. With the amount of genres in a library, it would not be hard to find an interesting story that does not contain dangerous or inappropriate content on it's pages."	7106	7107
5043	2	"Experiencing life and cultur is apart of growing up, even if @CAPS3 come aross as offence to someone else.  Removing a book or movie from a library is like removing @CAPS3 from history and cultur.     Kids @DATE1 are lacking cultral knowledge.  This is because @LOCATION1 is trying to sheltar the children.  According to a survey taken in @DATE2, sixty-four percent of books were edited by removing words such as the 'n' word.  Back in the day, that word wasn't used as an offensive term, but @DATE1 @CAPS3 is.  Children need to learn that as they grow up things change.  By taking books off of the shelf because one person doesn't like @CAPS3, then we would be left with no books. Sure, some books are offensive but without those books children can't learn.  Do you want your children to lack knowledge just because one perosn does not aprove of a message that is being portrayed?      If someone told you that they do not like your shirt, are you going to get rid of @CAPS3? If your child said I do not want to eat my fruit, are you going to let them skip on something healthy?  These are questions that need to be applied into other topics as well.  A survey, taken among high school teenagers in @DATE3, asked, 'Do you listen to music with vulgar words?' @CAPS1-four percent of the kids said that they do not.  Are we going to punish the rest of the kids for listening to music with vulgar words.  Of course we are not going to.       As a tenth grader I read the book '@CAPS2 @NUM1.'  @CAPS3 was about how the world was burning books.  If you got caught with any books you would be killed.  What if that happened in society @DATE1? How would our kids get the needed education in order to succeed in daily life.       Without the books, music, magazines, movies, etc., children and even adults will not ever learn about other parts of the world.  They will learn about how lucky they are to be in @LOCATION1 because they will not have the resources to research other parts of the world.  @CAPS3 is a right to be able to read and watch movies with offensive scences and chapters because that is what happens in real life.  Life is not perfect and @CAPS3 never will be.  By getting rid of books @CAPS3 is like getting rid of our rights as americans.     Our rights in @LOCATION1 give us the right to have freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion.  Just because someone does not agree with what someone else has to say does not mean that we are just going to take that away.  Censorship is doing that to our country.  Without the resources we have @DATE1, I would not be able to have the life experenes that I have had, good and bad.  Sometimes @CAPS3 takes a book to look at the world in a better place.  Sometimes @CAPS3 takes a movie to see what the war is like.  Sometimes @CAPS3 takes just a little vulgarity to understand the effects of things.  Sometimes all you need is a magaine to know what hair products you need.  By getting rid of what we need and what @CAPS3 takes, @CAPS3 gets rid of what people stand for.  The world is not a perfect place, and @CAPS3 will never be one.  So let people live their lives how they want to.  We cannot control what great things, or mistakes people make.  @CAPS3 is up to them"	7108	7109
5044	2	The idea of haveing such material on the shelf in a public librarie is offensive to some and can contain some offensive articles or footage. But if it is a public place and should be under the constitution and should free to express it and if you dont like it then stay away from it there is other meterials.      If you find what some public libaries put on there shelves is offensive then deal with it there is other sections of the library that you can look at things. You see here in the @LOCATION1 we have what is called freedom of speech and freedom of expression! Yes some library have footage and books and article of some things that either the white people have done or what othere races or countrys have done.     And you know what there just gonna have to deal with it its history or its the atmosphere or whats going on around them so there just gonna have to deal with it if its that bad or that hard to go in to your library then either find another library or find the internet and go on there and find it. Its life and people just have to deal with it in one way or another.     This is my opinion on wether or not such meterial in a public library can be displayed and i think it should be its a public place and the same freedoms fall underneath it as anywhere else its just up to us to decide on how to handle the situation. Thank you for read this and i hope you have taken in consideration in what is either the past or the present on todays society.	7110	7111
5045	2	"In libraries there are many things that needs to be taken off the shelf for plenty of reasons, people @MONTH1 not understand the possibilities and effets it @MONTH1 have on teens and minors.     I believe thats books, music, and etc. should be taken off shelves in libraries if found offensive, because it leads into alot of bad problems and effects. Music have alot of profanity in it and it leaves the teens and minors to using profanity because of librarians allowing them to take them off the shelves and check them out. I also believe that if its offensive to children then why is it placed where children things are placed at. I believe that libraries shoud personally put certain things like that into a private area where children can get to it unless a certain age. I also believe that if its offensive why take the risk of it, because when its all over the libraries would be in the wrong from the parents view for letting them check anything that wouold not be approved if it were there kids, so just keep it in a private room because it leads kids into the wrong directions in many ways.     I believe books can be very offensive because now most of teens are picking up sex books. I believe its very wrong because teens are to young to be reading things like this, because it leads them to doing majority of the things that are happening in the book because they have somewhat believed the book. The reason why I would know is because I had an past experience with a friend of mine that checked out a sex book and started doing things that had been said in the book because she believed what the author was saying was the right road to go down, my friend parents had found out and it lead the library to get in alot of trouble because she was a minor to be reading anything in this category in the book section.     I believe that if magazines are offensive , then the libraries needs to immediately take them down because there are alot of nudity in some magazines and its not a great site for children to be looking at pictures like that. I believe libraries should put them off the shelf because its not something children should be looking through around there age because they are so young. In my opinion I believe that they should be taken off the shelves because if the libraries would not approve there kids or younger siblings to do it why let other kids do somthing like this.     In conclusion, I believe that all libraries should fix this problem because it leads to alot of problems and drama, and it should all be avoided by doing a simple step and just take them off the shelves if they are offensive in any kind of way."	7112	7113
5046	2	"I do not think that books should be removed from the shelves in the libraries. If they are offensive to certain people, they don't have to read them. If kids are a problem, parents need to keep a closer eye on them.      Public libraries should have a variety of books for everyone. Meaning, different people like different things, maybe a book will be offensive to one person, but two or three others @MONTH1 be interested in it. The ones who are offended by it just don't need to read it. Not everyone is the same and not everyone has the same belief.      If i went to a library and wasn't able to find a book just because it might have been offensive to certain people, i @MONTH1 never go to that library again, that is loosing business. If more and more people look at it like i do, then there just @MONTH1 not be a library very much longer. Sometimes it's important to keep certain books in there. Maybe a middle schooler or high schooler is going to do a project for school and need the books to tell about the diversity in the world. Libraries need this variety of books on their shelves.      If younger kids getting ahold of the books is the problem, then the parents need to pay close attention to what the child is looking at. It @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a seven or eight year old, but maybe someone sixteen or seventeen would like it. As long as their parents don't mind it shouldn't be a problem for a teenager to want to read something.      If the public library were to get rid of all the books for censorship reasons they would loose business. If anything they could make different sections of the library to let parents and younger kids know that the stuff @MONTH1 not be suitable for them. Or put different markings on certain books that should only be read by eighteen or older, or books that only seven and younger would be interested in.      If not that, then there are other ways around the problem. There is no reason to take books off the shelf and loose customers just because a couple people are not going to like a book that maybe ten others will like. Libraries shouldn't have to worry about their selection of books, someone, somewhere, will eventually pick it up and read it"	7114	7115
5047	2	"Do we have the right to censor books from libaries? I think we should have the right to censor books,movies and music because not everything people put out there should be put out for kids.I think that the libraries censor things that include religon, violence, and racial rferences in video games movies and religon.     Violence is one of the worse things that should be censor because kids should be doing these things.Especially cartoons on @CAPS1,it has changed dramatically from '@CAPS2 and @PERSON2' to '@CAPS3'.It is the video games turn,because they show violence in the worse of ways.The worse video game is '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'.This  game is where you could steal cars and shoot people.Do you think this game is good for your kids?These games label like '@CAPS7 for everyone' does not help the matter.     I think censoring religons is anyones' opinion,but I think it should be censored to because this will confuse the kids and their religons.Some school libraries will not allow books like @CAPS8, @LOCATION1,or @CAPS9.Schools should teach religons because it is a family matter not public matter.If you want schools to teach your religon,take them to your religous school.     Racial references be censored because these will affect on how kids act towards other races.Schools ban the '@PERSON1'because of the racial undertones and of the @CAPS10 word.@CAPS1 shows in the @NUM1's had a lot of racist shows back then,but it had evolved a lot.Movies show a lot of racial references today and it has to be stopped.Especially army movies about @CAPS11 @CAPS12     I think kids are to gullible and learns everything they watch, read and hear.Sofor these reason tha that labraries should be allowed to censor books,music, and music."	7116	7117
5048	2	"Yes i do think if they find something at the library affensive it should be removed.Because there is already way too many things wrong with the economy now.Like racisim,racisim is one of the big problems we have in this country.If everybody would avoid the rummors and drama this country would be alot better.But everybody is worried about other peoples lifes.I would aslo have too say no though because the library is somewhere people go for help and something they take out might help them.That one little thing someone thought was offensive might have been something that would have been usefull for other little kids."	7118	7119
5049	2	"Everyone enjoys a nice day at the library. You walk in the front door, look around, and see that most people are busy diving into a new and exciting book. You do not want to be the only one looking around forever to try and find a book because your so ancious to begin your reading. There are countless shelves of reading material so you just pick a random book up and go to the nearest table and flip to the first page. Then you soon relize that you have just picked up the swimsuit addition to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Many people would think that is highly inappropreit but in my mind its just anuther peice of reading material that onyone can choose to read. I do not think people should get so worked up about a inapropriet book/magazine at a library.      Librarys have such a variety of books and magazines for people to read. There is a huge chance that there's at least a few mature books hidden away in those endless rows of books. If you let your kid go to the library to chose a new book to read and you feel like theres a chance he might pick up something he shouldn't be reading then watch him while hes picking one out. Its just that simple. The parents that get upset when they see there child reading something bad are most likely the ones who didn't bother to check what they had before they brang it home. Its there responcibility not the librarys to make sure they have a approtiet book in there hands when they leave.      Our countrys know for freedom to do things we enjoy. If some people enjoy the books that are '@CAPS3' rated then let them go crazy and pick out every '@CAPS3' rated book the library has to offer. That is there choice to do that not anyone else's. If people just began to take off the books that a few selected people find offesive to see at the library most likely there wouldnt be a whole lot to read anymore. Thats pretty much going agaist our constitution saying sertain people aren't alowed to read this and that.     The opinon of everyone are different. For example, just the other day I had scene a women at a library go up to the check out person and start complaining because the book she had said '@CAPS5' in it and her doughter read it. If I had read a book with the word '@CAPS5' in it when I was smaller I know for a fact my @CAPS7 wouldn't have a single problem with it. So there are plenty of different opinons for everybody. If all the librarys begun to get ride of all the books people had a problem with there would be nothing left. You can't go by what just a single person says or belives. If you don't like that book then you don't have to read it. Its the readers choice not the library's.     People shouldn't remove offensive books from the library. What one person thinks is offesive could be toltaly differnet from the next person who reads that book. So just go to the library and enjoy a book that you love to read. If that book happens to be inappropriet then put it back. Librarys are a place for peace of mind not a peice of contreversy and aurgument."	7120	7121
5050	2	"If a book, article,music,etc. is offensive to some people it should not be taken off the shelves for certain reasons. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to certain people it @MONTH1 just be offensive towards you does not mean its offensive to other people. Many people in this world have thier own beliefs and opinions just like I like hip hop and rap somebody might like rock and alternative see if I listen to rock and find it offensive because the song is about hurting other people does not mean it has to come off the shelves because that would not be fair to the people that listens to that music. I would not like it if some one took off hip hop because some one thinks that talking about a girl is bad or perverted or offensive.I think if you do not like our opinons or views about what a certain person likes do not read or try to view what that person likes if you think it would offend you. For example I stay with my hip hop and do not worry bout things that I know would or might offend me. I know if I try something new it always ends up that I like what I listen to now and thats hip hop and rap. So if you like rock and alternative it is not that hard to tell the difference from rap and rock so rockers stay away from rap if you think it would offend you. Rappers stay away from rock that you think would offend you!!                                                                      @PERSON1 @CAPS1                                                                                @CAPS2"	7122	7123
5051	2	"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That quote by Katherine Paterson proves a huge point. I believe that certain materials like books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are probably offensive to everyone at some point. Some materials can be quite appealing to some people, while for others it offends them deeply. I believe that these things should not be censored, unless they are absolutely vile.      Vile in definition is something that is completely horrible, in simplicity. Materials such as devil music, books, movies, magazines etc., should definitely be censored. These things should be sensored because it puts ideas in peoples heads and could potentially make people do bad things. I know that there are a lot of bad things in the world, but half of the people who do bad things are messed up. They don't need something like all this devil stuff messing with their mind even more.      Other things that should be censored are vile graphic things. Nobody wants their child or teen to be picking up extremely graphic materials and being able to check it out, simply just because they have a library card.      On a different perspective, in my opinion nothing else in libraries should be censored. For example if you have a book about @CAPS1, a christian might love it but an atheist is not going to appreciate it. If you have rap music in your library, a teenager who is in to that might love the music, but a adult who grew up listening to the classics or the oldies might hate it. What I'm getting to is you can't just take something out of a public library just because it offends some people.      Books that many children love to read is @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 which has become a worldwide phenonmenon. I, however, know of many parents how have never let their child pick any of the books or movies up, because its witchcraft. There is nothing wrong with @ORGANIZATION2. For some children, like me when I was younger, it's a chance to escape from the real world and be able to really get into reading. I remember hating reading when I was little, until @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 that is.      Schools and even libraries want children to pick up reading, and really be interested in it. @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 has done that for some children and teens. On that note, why should we ban something from our libraries that help children? Many christian parents think that it is just 'pure devil' and will never let their children read or watch the movies. I am christian and very active in church, and I really don't see anything wrong with any of the @ORGANIZATION2 books or movies.      People get offended every day. Some by church, schools, reading material, music, etc. People are just going to have to get over it. The old quote '@CAPS2 mans junk is another mans treasure', is kind of similar to this situation. @CAPS2 person @MONTH1 not care for the type of music, reading material or movies that are in our libraries today, but another person @MONTH1 really get the content of it and enjoy it.      Going back on the quote by @PERSON1, I believe that the materials in libraries should not be censored. Just because some people find materials 'offensive', doesn't mean that they actually are. Unless the materials have something like devil stuff or is very graphic that simply does not belong in a public library, then there is no cause for censorship in libraries. Many people are different. The world would be boring if we were all the same"	7124	7125
5052	2	"I belive that removing materials from the shelves of libraries is wrong. No one's oppertunity to read a book, or watch a movie should be taken away because a handfull of people do not agree with it. Someone's oppinion should not justify wheather or not a book is 'good' or 'bad' and needs to be removed for everyone.     I understand that there are books that we don't agree with. Every person has his/her own opinion and finds certain subjects or ideas unexceptable. This opinion should not be able to control everyone else's lives also. For example, if I find a murder mystery story about a ghost too graphic and I do not believe in ghost's that is fine. I don't have to read this book. On the other hand, there might be someone who loves a good novel full of suspense and wonder at what is going to happen next. Just because I do not agree with the book and it's content does not mean that it should be taken off shelves.      Another example is music. A good number of people go to their local library to get a @CAPS1 to listen to. I know I do. If I walked in one day looking for the new @CAPS1 of my favorite @CAPS3 band and found it gone I would be very disapointed. Especially if I found out it had been taken off of shelves because someone with different religious views found it offensive. I know that there are many different religions in this world and that everyone has their own ideas, but someones views should not take away my happiness or enjoyment.      If censorship continues in libraries across the @LOCATION1, what will be left? One day we'll be taking our grandchildren to to the library so that we can pick out our favorite childhood story and read it to them. When we arrive, we will be shocked to find this story gone because a group of people didn't agree with the views of the author or ideas in the story.      In conclusion, I strongly believe that censorship should not be aloud to continue in libraries. I'm convinced that our future generations will be deprived of great literature in the years to come. This is why removing materials from the shelves of libraries for good is wrong"	7126	7127
5053	2	I belive that censorship is wrong! Books and magazines should be the way they were ment to be.     If the books and magazines are to bad to be read or watched by little kids than just have it where only kids in highschool can look at and if it is still to bad just for that only allow seniors to view or read it or other grades in highschool can if they have thier parents permision.     Censorship shouldnt be allowed it can be taken offinsive to people who like the book and more especially the author. Censorship is like telling the author that the book is to violent for people in school to see which is wrong cause there is a bunch more movies and all the rest in the world especially on @CAPS1.V.      The things that are offinsive should not be removed from shelfs if someone finds offensive than dotn read it or watch it. It's thier fault for doing that when they know they will be offended.     I belive that everything should be allowed for people to view or read. If they find it offensive than they should put something on the cover or back letting them know that it is. If they still want to watch or view it its thier fault cause they know it would be offended.	7128	7129
5054	2	"Most of us have read a book in our highschool or middle school years that had some sort of offensive materials.  These books are not meant for younger people to read so they should never be in the kids section of the library or in a middle school english class.  Once children start to mature and grow up, they will be able to move onto these books that have offensive material or profanity.  There is a good message or a great story hidden behind some of that bad material, thats why some of us highschoolers start reading some of those type of books.  There are also more reasons why offensive books should be keep on the shelves for some to admire and some to dislike.       Ovbiously there are reasons that some of us @MONTH1 not know or @MONTH1 never find out that make a book interesting.  The topics such as sex, crime, rape, and racism are things that anyone and everyone will have to deal with in every day life.  These books will be history some day but some will have offensive materials in them.  Most books will have some racism or talk about sex and bad words.  That is something that we will have to get passed when the real message is trying to be deliverd behind all of that badness.   An example of a book that has some bad material in it is '@DATE1' by @PERSON2.  This book has lots of sex and crime but relays a message of dystopias and utopias.  If you have read it there is a utopia called the @ORGANIZATION1 which is filled with greenery and beautiful sights.  The bad side is a nation called @LOCATION1 which is run by the party and a totalitarian government.  The two sides are very differnent in many ways which you will never know if you dont read it.  It is a classic book that most highschoolers read, and they have to get past the sex and crime to get to the main message.  For those of you who think it is inapropriate to have books with this kind of material in them you  should try reading a classic like '@DATE1' or 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'.  There are some disturbing and intense scenes but they are  great books that have good information about how something was in the past or how something could be if something went wrong like in @DATE1'.       For those of you that refuse to read books with profanity, sex, crime, torture, and racism.  You should try reading them and maybe you will find that behind the badness there is something that you will cherish for the rest of your life.  I would recomend 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4' by @PERSON1 for those of you who love action packed adventure novels.  There are some mental images that will appear when you read parts that @MONTH1 not be the most pleasant.  When you start to get into the novel you wont stop until you have read all three in the series.  After that you wont stop thinking about them because they are so good, and maybe you will even read them twice like I did.  Try to read one of these books and maybe you will gain a unique perspective."	7130	7131
5055	2	"Criminal @CAPS1 at @CAPS2     If there was a book about the @CAPS8 shouldn't it be taken down for violence and gore, No it shouldn't but the book about a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 going on killing spree is even tho it has the same nature has the @CAPS8.  Censorship is croupt just because you hear something you think is wrong or gruesomedosen't mean it should be censored because of your beliefs.Censoring any form of art or entertainment is an overreaction to anything that you don't like because thats what censorship is the nations strong and manipulative overraction to something very simple.     The first amendment declares are freedom of speech, but has that really been hold true just because someone says foul language. Does that mean we should censor them? Well if you want to break the first amendment then yeah go right ahead and be a little dictator just like @CAPS5. You can't decide or shouldn't decide what is bad or ok to hear for everyone thats unfair because we have many different ethnicities and cultures here.Also the reason why other kids are possibly smarter then @CAPS4 kids is because there is very little censorship if any in most countries arcoss the ocean.     Think about it would you really want your kid to say fuck and not know what it means before hand so maybe he won't say it, or would it better if you told him what it means and not to say it for that reason, so he possible won't say it. Sense lets face it when he grows up he is going to hear that word from somewhere else regardless if it's censored in the media or not.     Censorship is part of the crimianl mind @CAPS5 used it to take control of @LOCATION1 and the rest of @LOCATION2. There should be no one deciding whats bad or good to say in the media by censoring it. A kid should be able to read a book about the @CAPS8 and ,or about the violent @CAPS3 @CAPS4."	7132	7133
5056	2	"Some libraries contain offensive articles of knowledge; books, music, magazines, and movies that contain content that some could consider insulting or bothersome. There is a concern as to whether or not these pieces of information should be kept in libraries or removed.     Offensive books, magazines, music, and movies will always exist as long as hatred between people exists. Removing them from the library will not solve any problems, but rather would only hinder the development of a higher tier of understanding between people as a result of past mistakes. Also, some pieces of information such as these, that could be considered offensive, @MONTH1 contain important details and contributions to knowledge, such as historically important details, that would be overlooked if one simply saw the offense in the information. On the other hand, if such pieces of information are kept in libraries, they could provide a way for unrest to increase, and offend many people. This is the only legitimate reason to remove them, and it does not compete with the reasons to keep them. If history is offensive to us, then we are the ones that need to change, not history.     These articles, therefore, should be kept and not restrained. We, as humans, can all learn from our past mistakes and strive for a higher level of morality and righteousness. What was done in the past, no matter how small and insignificant or how large and ground-breaking, was done in the past and should stay in the past. We should not take offense to what has been done, but rather we should see the offense of the past and prevent it in the future. We should not cover up our mistakes and pretend they don't exist simply because they're a little painful, but rather we should embrace the truth and use it to have a greater attitude of love and forgiveness toward eachother."	7134	7135
5057	2	"Has anyone been to a library and picked up a offence book, magazine, or maybe watch a movie form there, or music. Well I belive that they should remove books, movies, music, or magazines becuase of offense.     First of all, I belive that they shold remove any books, movies, magazines, or music that have to do with either gender being sexists. This is a federal crime and can be viewed as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So reason being @CAPS1 @CAPS4 can cause embaresment. Also, some people have been abused, and this can bring back memories and a possibility of being emotionally scared.     On another note, videos, music, books, or magazines that has offense with racism should be removed because this is also a federal crime, and is still an issue everywhere today. This can ecourage bullies and harmful offenders in our community.     Last thought, some adults @MONTH1 pick up a book or watch a movie, or hear music. Most of the adults in the @LOCATION1 today have children, grandhcildren,a nd great grandchildren. So having these offensive videos and music, books, magazines or artickles can encourage and teach new generations something unacceptable. This can and will encourage teens and elementary schoolers to smoke, be akind to racist or sexist. Having more teens and children learn these new ideas can cause alot of stress on other, and a possible death.     Seeking these possibilities can cause many harmful things. Emotionally scared, death, embaresment, etc. what do you belive now? Have you thought about all of the possibilities?"	7136	7137
5058	2	"I do not believe in the censorship of libraries. It takes good reading material away from people just because a few people think it's offensive. I mean what if I just didn't like a book? I could just tell the library I think it's offensive and then no one would ever be able to read that book again.     If they removed books people thought were bad eventually there would be no books at all because not everyone thinks one thing is explicit. Everyone has there own differnet views. So someone could think a book about murder is offensive but then someone who likes to read books about murder @DATE1 say that this book is fine. Like I said, no one thinks the same books should be removed so eventually it would come down to there being almost no books in a library or, someone would get offeneded becuase there book wasn't removed.     Another point I would like to make. There books. Why does it matter if there offensive or not? If you don't like what you see then don't read it. I mean it's not like someone is making you read it right? So why not instead of making a huge deal out of it and trying to ban a bunch of books people like, why not just put teh book down and go read one that you think is less offensive. Sounds a lot easier to me.     Now to focus on the movies. Movies can be offensive. Everyone knows that and everyone also knows that there are ratings. So you wouldn't think of a @NUM1 movie being offensive while, on the other hand you would think of a rater @CAPS1 movie being offensive. It got rated @CAPS1 for something right? So instead of banning movies that people think are offensive why don't you just put on the rating '@DATE1 be offensive to some people'. That way if they get it and see it they will know it might be offensive and then they know not to get it or to read a review first.     My last point in this argument is the music category. Music is like talking to a beat or some type of instrument. If we ban some types of music that's almost like banning some types of talking. You can't go around and stop people from talking like that so why should the people who get paid to do it have to getting banned? It's banning the freedom of speech. If rappers and singers can't rap and sing then there needs to be a law that soon follows that says people can't talk like that.     In conculsion I don't think at all the there should be censorship in libraries. People just need to man up and either take the offensive material or start checking it out before they read it. It's no ones fault but there own if they get offended. The author didn't tell them to read that book. They need to have the responsibility to blame themselves for getting offended and not try to censor everyone's stuff"	7138	7139
5059	2	"I dont believe that any books, music, movies, magazines etc are offensive in any way. Im not saying that all books, movies, or magazines have inappropriate stuff in them because some of them do. Its the readers responsibilty to learn or know about the music, book, movie or magazine before they check it out. I also think that if your going to check out something you shouldn't judge it by it's cover because you never know how good what you got in your hand can be.       When a reader goes to the library it's his/her responsibility to know what type of book, magazine, music, and even movie they want to check out. If the reader sees that what they are looking for is not there, then they should explore more options. I feel like just cause you see books with inappropriate stuff in them dont mean they are terrible books.      I think that libraries should have different sections for all kinds of books. Like for example, they should seperate the ones that have bad language from the ones that don't. Libraries should also seperate the ones that have horrible or inappropriate grpahics then the ones who have regular graphics that support their ideas.      If you want to check out books, movies, magazines or even music from the library, then you should talk to the librarian so she can help you with what your looking for. If you find anything that your looking for offensive then don't check it out and put it back on the shelve and check out othr books you think might interest you. Just because you find something that you don't like or it's offensive to you don't mean you should go and ruin it for everybody else. Everyone should be able to find what they are looking for in the library because thats what libraries are for.     I enjoy reading books about the author's lives because they teach you alot about life. They talk about their experiences, the mistakes and bad decisions they made. They also mention everything they did to make their lives better. I hope to one day write a book about my life because alot has happened in my life. I personally don't mind finding and reading all types of books because each book teaches you a different thing"	7140	7141
5060	2	"I think that those things should stay in the libraries. Those things considered offensive or inapropriate have their own category. If it is considered  offensive to you, the consumer, then why even look at or even think about that book, movie, magazine, or article. It only makes sense to get what you can handle. I feel that hundreds of others should not have to suffer because one person doesn't like what they hear, say, or feel, while reading a certain piece. Some people love to read or watch intense or sensative entertainment. They have the books sectioned off by category. How much more easy could it be to find what YOU want to entertain you? The point that I am trying to stress is that there is a different category of entertainment for every different individual unique person living in this earth."	7142	7143
5061	2	"There are many types of books that people choose that others @MONTH1 not. It @MONTH1 be because the book does not appeal to his or her taste or it is inappropriate.  Either way, it all is the same in that everyone has an opinion on what can and cannot be read, especially when thinking of the children. There are some materials that should not be read or shelved at a library where everyone can see it.  Even if there are some who @MONTH1 want to read it, there is absolutely no reason to keep it shelved and it should be removed to avoid influence towards the children and ourselves.     When one goes to the library and sees books or movies that are inappropriate, what is usually done? Well, they can walk away or choose to report to the librarian to remove the material from the shelf.  Both of these options should be what are done, because it should not be there in the library for eyes to see and it shouldn't be where you are either. The needs and safety of the children needs to be in consideration too.  A child does not and should not know as much as we do as adults.  It would affect both our children's and our lives if they ever see something that you don't want them to read out in the open. If your children are in a section where there is something that you don't want them to read, then the material needs to be removed so that they can be protected from the issues in this corrupt world.     If people started to report materials that they do not like all of the time, what will happen to the shelves full of books?  According to Katherine Paterson, an author, she says that there would be no more books left on the shelf if everyone went and picked out a book they didn't like.  Everything in this world is based off of opinion:  how one looks, their favorite sports, and their favorite books. There is no two people that are exactly alike and that is why there is so many different tastes in reading topics.       No matter their own opinion, people should consider other's thoughts on certain books.  One can't just rip a book off of the shelf because of their dislike towards it. I'm not saying offensive books are okay to keep on the shelf.  I'm saying that it should be truly inappropriate for it to be reported instead of it being over favorite books.  It should be one that almost everyone thinks is wrong for people to see.  Shouldn't things that are offensive be removed so that it can protect everyone, especially our children, from influence?  It's okay to not like a book or some music that someone else does. When that happens, you can just walk away and find your own favorites. But when there is something that does not need to be seen by anyone, we need to be the person that will remove it from the shelf to avoid having people finding it as something good to read."	7144	7145
5062	2	"Do you think censorship in libraries is beneficial? I don't find it beneficial at all.  Some books, movies, movies, or magizine @MONTH1 be found offencive to one person.  This does not mean that the other people that visit the library would find it offenseive.  So it would not really be fair to take one's enjoyment away from them because one person found it to be offensive.      Katherine Paterson states, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... And then we have no books lieft on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 that if she can take a book off the shelf of a library because she finds it offensive, then so can anyone else.  Leading to there not being any books left.  This would definitely not be beneficial to anyone.      Censorship in libraries should not be allowed.  It takes away some peoples entertainmeant, and the students resources.  If a student needed one of the books that had been removed from the self for a research project, what are they going to use?  This is what censorship in libraries does, it takes away and no benefits are gained.  So why have it?      Most people would be rather angry if someone was to come up to them and say 'I don't like that book, it offended me' and take the book out of thier hands and throw it away.  This is what it would be like, just not directly out of someones hands.  Maybe it was thier favorite book.  It would leave them with no entertainment.  That would be quite unfair.     Not only would it affect the people who read the books, but maybe even the people who make or write the books.  If a book is removed from a library or two, then it would mean that the company would have less places to distribute to, causing them to lose money.  It would also probably cut down on the sale of the book around that area.  Giving them less copies sold, loing them money.  This could also offend the author of the book.  If someone works hard to write and publish a book and have just one person getting offended by it, all thier work goes down the drain becuase no one that goes to that library can read it.      So what exactly would be the point of censorship? To comfort one man but take away anothers entertainment? To steal the resources of a student? Or to offend the author? Censorship in libraries is not a good thing. In no way could it be beneficial to anyone, besides to that one selfish person"	7146	7147
5063	2	"I do believe that offensive items should be removed from libraries shelves if they are found hurtful and or devastating.  Censoring those materials are great ideas, it allows you to read the story peacefully.  I've been in many occasions where I felt as if the book should have used a better word choice or not have written about that topic.  Also in many movies censorship could play a big roll, but instead you have to buy parental control and other ect.. to make sure what your family and friends watch and hear is apropritate.         I remember years ago I saw a documentry about the (@CAPS1)    or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  In this documentry repeatily these men use the '@CAPS4' word, I found offensive because here we have a film directed by a @CAPS2 guy with a @CAPS2 guy '@CAPS4' bashing and not once did the director tell him to use another word or anything.  now we have the opportunity to watch it, and order it from the library as opposed to a rap video being in stock. As offensive as it might be to me its not to the next guy.     I ask myself would i let my child read this book before i purchase.  Some wonder why does it matter; because those books you will check out or movies will get lost in somebody will find it hopefully not a child.  So just to be safe censor what you can and what you know absolutely needs to be censored.       I would say censorship could be useful to every one, it better the things the reader says in everyday life.  My personal modo is 'if you dont see it, hear it, then you won't use it."	7148	7149
5064	2	"They are racist! They are bawdy! They are downright wrong for our children to be reading! These are possible statements parents could be saying about certain books being published and on the shelves in our libraries. Some of these parents also would want the possibility to censor the books their children have access to by simply taking them off the shelves. I believe that censoring books is a good idea to a certain extent. Books should be censored if, and only if, they are extremely offensive and innapropriate to the age of the readers.     There are some bad things that could come from this becoming a reality of course. Some peoples favorite books might be categorized as too innapropriate for it's readers, so that person cannot read it anymore. This is the part of the subject that can couse many problems between opposing sides of the arguement. Who decides where the cutoff point is for being taken off the shelves and staying? I think that if a book is so bad that it needs to be taken off the shelves, it will be very obvious.     One thing libraries can do to get around this problem is to create age limits on certain books. This way children cannot check out books that are too racy for them to be reading. They could also create 'adult sections' in the library that you must be at least eighteen years old to enter. This would help enforce the age limit on books so the children do not try to sneak the books out just to read them. Parents also can get involved if they feel the need. If they feel like their children shouldn't read books that might taint their minds, then they should talk to their children and tell them what they can and cannot read.     My opinion is that we should have each town or even each school elect a board of representatives that vote on which books should stay and which should go. This way, nobody has the right to complain that they didn't get a say in a certain book that got removed from the shelves. I also believe that children, or certain children, are old and mature enough to make their own decisions and read only books they feel is right for them to read at their age. Although some children are not mature enough to make these decisions, they shouldn't all be penalized.     So, not every 'average person,' as @PERSON1, an author states, has the right to remove books that they do not like, but they should have the right to at least give their @MONEY1 on the matter. Some books, some might say, are so offensive they have no right to be in the hands of adults let alone kids, while others believe that those books are the best books they have ever read. Because this matter is so contraversial, no one thing can solve this problem. The best thing a family or a parent can do, is to censor their own children until their town or school comes up with a system on how to ban certain books. I have read books that were, in my opinion, rated @CAPS1 ranging all the way up to rated @CAPS2, but none of them were bad enough to censor. Each person has their own opinion on what is good or bad, so they should censor the books in their own lives, not in everyone else's lives around them."	7150	7151
5065	2	"Certain materials such as, books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. can be found to be offensive. Material like those should not be read, heard, or seen, because it can start drama.I can relate to times in my life where i couldn't watch something or read soomething ,because I couldn't handle what they were saying. All in all, i think that they should remove anything that has wrongful meaning behind it.       I can relate to a time when a book or magazine brought me down because of what it said. I got done early with an assignment so I was shuffling through some magazines in class when i came across a newspaper saying that @ORGANIZATION1 isn't @CAPS1. That made me think about how ignorant people could be if they truly believe that, if he wasn't @CAPS1 than he wouldn't be president.      Also, if a material is talking bad about anyone of high power, or of an ethnic group that i think it shoud be banned. I was watching the news one day, and they were talking to someone about what they thought about @CAPS1 soldiers being in @LOCATION1, and he proposed that we just bomb it like we bombed @LOCATION2. I thought that wasn't right and that no one should say that on national television. It was rude and somewhat racist. I could only imagine how people that were from the middle east felt.      Just to think about young kids glancing over something that involves hate or discrimination is enough to make you wonder if they are doing anything to solve this promblem. I think that they should ban anything and everything that is contriversal. Or maybe, they should put a rating on certain books and music like they do movies, so kids can't look at them or listen to them"	7152	7153
5066	2	"Today i write this essay to convince people to remove a few books and magizines off the shelves. Here are a few books and magizines that i have in mind. MAD @CAPS1, all fiction books, world record books, and expecially adult entertainment and all magazines and books that arent educational.           Theese items listed above are all for our entertainment. I think theese items are unessessary and should be forbidden for our younger viewers, adults and expecially our teens. even though there are many types of topics that have covered but there are some that should never exist.     Theese days our younger viewers are seeing and copying everything they see and read because they think its ok because other people are doing it, and to this day our teens are takeing actions for themselvs without even thinking about their actions or the consiquences first.      There are many actions that can be taken to for this to be successful. I feel that the whole @CAPS2 @CAPS3 should become more strict than we already are. Even though there are age limits for our books and magazines i feel people should be asked for their @CAPS4 if they dont have one than they cant rent or buy their product that they want.      By takeing theese actions I believe this will change the behaviors of out younger viewers if all of our reading materials were educational. Even our local schools contain unnessary reading materials in the library.Also i strongly euge our local schools to discontinue theese materials.     I strongly believe if theese actions are taken and if they are sucessful i honestly believe that our young readers will become more knowledgeable and more successful in the near future"	7154	7155
5067	2	"Books getting removed from shelves, that's censorship. And censorship can happen in libraies. Sometimes it's a good thing. But, most of the time, removing books from shelves isn't really a good thing.          An example of a book that has been removed from a libray is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It got banned becasue of witchcraft and wizardry. Now, I think that is kind of ridiculous. But, some people viewed that book was teaching kids the wrong thing and it was isn't right to let there kids be taught magic.           Another example of a book that got removed from shelves, this time in a school library, is @CAPS3. It got banned becasue of what went on the story. I understand why this book would get banned. This book is a little to much for young kids and I think it getting banned was a good thing.           If libraians were to remove all the offensive books in their libraies, there would be nothing left, but the information type books. But even then, some of those books could be offensive. And, there wouldn't be anything left. There'd probably be some books left, but overall, most books would be gone.      Music could get banned becasue of the singers, or the message it's putting out. Magazines could get banned becasue of what's on the cover. Also, movies could get banned because of what the movie has on it's cover or how it's rated. So, anything could get removed from a library by the littlest detail.      Censorship in a library, in a way, is kind of pointless. Only becuase, if the library doesn't have that book or magazine or movie or type of @CAPS4 someone wants, they can just go out and buy it. Then, the library could be loosing some business.      Overall, I believe that censoship in a library isn't really necessary. But, for somethings, I guess it would be okay. But, I don't think censorship in libraries should be aloud"	7156	7157
5068	2	The books should be left on the shelf because they might not be offencive to other people. So if you think the book is offencive then put it back and dont read it. If you take all the books that are offencive then there might not be any left because alot of books are uncencerd. So insted of takeing them away jsut separate them and put them in a different section so no one has to worrie about it. Just go to the section thats cencerd or uncencerd so theres no problems.	7158	7159
5069	2	"Should 'offensive' materials, such as books, movies, music,magazines, ect. Be taken off the shelf? My argument would be no. It is not that there offensive, it is the way people view them. What might be offensive to one person, might not be offensive to another. So therefore, people should read about the book before checking it out. If people are worried about there kids picking up an innapropriate book, they need to make sure they keep their child in the juvenile section. Which most libraries have now.           The term 'offensive' can be taken differently by anyone. You can run into offensive things anywhere. Why make such a big deal about a book in the library? People like to learn about different things, maybe different from what you are used to learning. So therefore, you might find what someone else is reading/learning about offensive, because it is not your style so much.           Parents always worry about their children seeing something before they are old enough, and even doing something. I can understand why some parents might be a little bit hazey when it comes to their children and the library, because no parent wants their child to see something before it is their time to learn about that certain thing. Like for instance, they could pick up a book about drugs and start to wonder about it, and either a) get curious about them more and want to try them. Or b) they could be the smart kid and refrain from them and go off of what they had read about the drugs being bad. This is a reason why I think all libraries should have a juvenile section, so we can avoid that problem.     There is always going to be something out there someone is going to find offensive. Whether it is a book, a poster, a movie, a type of music or song. People just need to learn to turn the other cheek and get over it, because there is more offensive things in than a book."	7160	7161

Some visitors are very sensitive to what is placed at the library for others to view, and causes some corruption among the visitors. They @MONTH1 become offended by what is placed on the shelves, for everyone to decide their interests, which leads to them wanting to learn more about them. Everyone has their own opinion into what is offensive to them, or not. Even though, some @MONTH1 take offense to what is placed on the self, these materials shouldn't be removed, because of the select few who are taken offense of the certain materials.     Many of the materials are placed into different styles, genres, and age groups. Authors write in styles which showcases their skills for everyone to see. Different styles are created, for everyone to experience and discover their own interests. For instance, children love picture books. Picture books are a marvelous way for children to be entertained while being read to. These pictures also help tell the story. Therefore, children prefer picture books, rather than giant chapter books, from the adult section. @PERSON1 is a great example, for an author who is talented to write for children. His poems and pictures are a wonderful combination to enhance the reading of a young mind.     Another style of writing would be for young adults. This selection of the community, has a some-what developed mind. However, its still developing, still gaining insite. Authors choose to write about romances, adventure tales, and almost anything to grasp the teenager's mind. Grasping the teenager's mind, allows the author to tell a story along with teaching the reader an important life lesson. An example for this selection of people, would be any selection from @PERSON2, a young adult writer, who writes about how beauty comes from within, and how every girl should be treated like a princess, no matter what.     Then there's the adult minds. Adult minds are mostly already fully developed. They all have different opinions on which interests themselves, as a person. This should be taken into consideration, when the library decides to remove some of their selection. Authors should write in a more sophisticated way for this group of people. They are also very picky about what it is they are looking for, and what interests themselves as a person.      The removal of materials, which @MONTH1 be offensive to some people is not the brightest idea, for a library to do. Somethings are offensive to certain people, while it @MONTH1  not be offensive to another. Everyone has their own opinions, interests, likes, and dislikes. By removing these materials, which @MONTH1 cause offense, is a disgrace of the true value of intellect a certain indivial @MONTH1 possess.     Some things, @MONTH1 be needed for school, such as writing, project, and learning topics. These topics might interest the young mind, and they would like to learn more about this certain topic. Some older individuals @MONTH1 take some of the topics, their child or grandchild is learning, offensive but they should know that everyone has their own opinion.      Taking away certain materials, because of the offense of someone's own opinion is uncalled for. If all libraries removed anything that offended someone, they wouldn't have anything left to share with the community. Censorship is not needed in libraries. It is an awful way for them put into the position to descreat the idea that everyone has their own opinion on a certain topic.      With everyone possessing their own opinion, they can be very sensitive and take offense to the littlest of things. People are given the chance to learn something new, by visiting a library. If the library removed any material that slightly offended a single person, everyhthing would be terminated and no one would be able to learn something new. Censorship is not a necessity in a library. Any interest, opinion, topic are necessary for a mind to develop and think. They should be able to learn without anyone constantly telling them about what is offensive or not. Nothing should be removed from the libraries of the community, for a learning mind is a healthy mind. We need a place to learn more about a specific topic besides school. So please keep the materials in the library, for everyone to have an opportunity to learn something new or in more depth."	7162	7163
5071	2	"Some people @MONTH1 find books, music, movies, magazines, etc. offensive and some of them don't find it offensive. In my opionion I'm siding with yes and no. Yes because of religion reviews, certain books and no because of some movies.     To begin with, I don't find certain kinds of movies offensive just because we hear cursing everyday in this world. Yes, some movies are violant and gory but we all know most movies like that are planned and fake. Some music such as, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, they give positive meaning on life and about @CAPS3. Unlike how most people listin to that rap crap, now that doesn't have a postive side to it. I mean who would really want to be a pimp and abuse drugs and women?     Next, some of the books, movies, magazines offends me because, when it comes to magazines such as, The @CAPS4 and others along that line if offends most of the adults in the @LOCATION1. Girls' shouldn't be posing like that and not wearing any clothes and selling their bodies off to everyone. They are showing bad examples for younger childrens and making perverts worst because they think it's okay to rape little kids.      However, when some movies are using the '@CAPS5' word constantly it offends @CAPS2 people because to us you're disrespecting our @CAPS3 and taking his name in vain. You should have more respect for him than you do with anybody else. He is the one who died for your sins so why disrespect him? We should be living for him and respecting him!     In conclusion, I sided with yes and no because I believe and think that certain kind of movies, books, music, and magazines are offensive."	7164	7165
5072	2	"Literature, the quest for knoweldge. Can selct forms of  knoweldge harm our youth? The @NUM1 century @LOCATION1 is constantly changing. A parent who once freely went to purchase an ice cream cone after school as a child will no longer allow their children to do the same. The hightened level of supervision is due to the changes in our society that are available to harm children. Libraries are being sought out as danger in a different form. The potential to harm our children through choice language and negative @CAPS9 content is all around them. Parents believe they  have a right to voice their opinion on protecting their children. However, children have to face the harsh fact of reality at some point in their lives.     An example of controversy is @PERSON1, a classic @CAPS1 writer. @PERSON1 has produced numerous @CAPS1 classic novels. However, the time period of @PERSON1's works dates back to a time where certain terms were socially normal. @PERSON1's work entitled '@CAPS3 @CAPS4,' has been questioned in recent journalism reports due to the use of a word associated in current culture as a derogatory term towards @CAPS5 @CAPS6. A parent's worst nightmare is to hear the use of such terms in their child's language. A child will eventually hear the word, if not through a novel such as @PERSON1's '@CAPS3 @CAPS4.' A parent's duty is to educate their children that such terms are not socially acceptable. Exposure to novels containing controversial language should be viewed as a tool to open conversations between parents and their children. Even though a child shouldn't be accessible to these novels until a certain age, an early opportunity is open to start creating a child's basis between what is right and what is wrong. Novels, such as @PERSON1's, should be kept on the shelves to help educate children on right and wrong, as well as @LOCATION1's past.     Books are not the only available materials at circulation desks. Libraries have grown to accomodate the advancing forms of information created in the @NUM2 and @NUM1 centuries. Thus, some libraries have changed their names to the term '@CAPS9 @CAPS10.' A child has access to books, music files, movies, and magazines at today's libraries. However, some materials in a library are intended for adults only. Until a certain age, a parent should guide their child through the library to help choose appropriate materials. A strong foundation of values and the child's intersts should guide the parent and child to choose materials in a library. The parent's responsibility is to help the child distinguish materials intended for their age range from materials intended for adults. Guidance in the early stages of development @MONTH1 help the child in their decision making process in the future. @CAPS9 related forms of information with questionable content should be left on shelves to help parents educate their children of what is appropriate for them. The materials should be left available, so when the child reaches adolescence, they can integrate adult forms of material into their lifestyle to prepare them for the real world.     Children are not the only issue to censorhip. Adults in the library community can be sensitive to select language and images as well. @CAPS9 companies, such as @CAPS11 @CAPS12, have made @CAPS9 forms accessible that block nudity and offensive language. An early adolescent @MONTH1 be able to view this type of @CAPS9 with their parent, as the @CAPS9 does not open the door into confusion and questions on a large scale. Adults @MONTH1 also choose to view this form of @CAPS9 over the non censored versions due to personal taste. However, materials with censorable content should still be made available to the people who would like to utilitze them. Libaries are funded through tax dollars, thus some citizens @MONTH1 feel libraries should serve the community as the community sees fit.     Censorship is a growing issue in this country, that the public must tackle at some point. If parents don't explain adult materials to their children during development, who will? @CAPS1 literature and @CAPS9 crucial to the education of our past must never be forgotten. Reality is growing upon us, and the public must find a new way to interpert reality for themselves, as well as their children. By blocking censorship in our libraries, we can prepare our youth and ourselves for the harsh realities of an ever changing world, and question our morals as to what is right and what is wrong"	7166	7167
5073	2	"Censoring Books in the @CAPS1      Have you ever went into a local @CAPS1 and found a really interesting book or movie that @MONTH1 in some way offend someone else? Many people have done this, and a lot of the things that people @MONTH1 like @MONTH1 be something that should be censored so others wont feel uncomfortable. I think that the libraries should keep all things on the shelves, but when someone wants to check something out they should have to be responsible for anything some @MONTH1 say if they get offended at something they are reading, and everyone who gets offended should realize that most likely its not done on purpose. By doing this I think that people would eventually get use to the idea and it would become a second nature to people that visit the @CAPS1. If we actually try to do this good things could happen and bad things can be prevented.     Books are not the only thing that can offend someone there are many other things like music lyrics, art, book covers etc. When people go to check out different things in the @CAPS1 most likely they are not thinking that it would offend someone, it could just be something for recreational purposes.  I personally think that children should not be allowed to check something offensive to people out of the @CAPS1 unless a parent is giving there child permission.  I think this should be done because most likely when a child finds out that something they have is making someone angry, they will use it against that person almost every time. Almost anything brought from anywhere can offend someone and most people dont even know it because it is not done intentionally.     Some things that can easily offend someone are things that have to deal with religion, ethnicity, slavery, ku klux klan, powerful ones, presidents and many other things.  All these topics can be checked out at any @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 go to.  An example of this can be when a child in grade school or even an adult in college have an assignment on something to do with slavery and racism back in those days.  Most likely they will have to do research and check out books on these things to complete the assigned task; the @CAPS1,a great cash friendly place to go get the information, can be of a major assistance in providing them with anything that they @MONTH1 need to fulfill this task.  Now that they have their information they take there resources back to class and lets say an @CAPS2-@CAPS3 student gets offended at the cover of a book on slavery because it is showing a @CAPS4 person being abused; later a @CAPS5 gets offended because of a poem about how they treated blacks back in the days.  They apparently dont think those things should be in these books and thats a personal problem on their part because no one was looking to offend them.  Now everyone in the class is offended and causing chaos all over simple books allowed to exit the @CAPS1 with someone who had no intention of offending anyone. These books are of help to everyone, and most likely the people should know whats done on purpose or intentionally and when someone is simply completing an assignment or even reading just to learn more on the subject,they should know they have nothing to do with them.      It is not the libraries job to monitor who checks out what and why they want to read something and to be sure that all the books in there viscinity are not offensive to people because it is impossible to know the answer to all those questions.  The librarians do not have the time to make sure no one will get offended over something because they dont know how every single person feels about any certain item. Just like the example of the school assignment there would have been no way the person checking those books out would have known the class would get upset over something that occured many years ago and no longer taking place.  It is up to the ones reading these books and getting offended over things to straighten matters on their own. Eventually the problem would slowly go away if everyone works together.      To answer this statement honestly I say No I dont think the @CAPS1 should censor anything and they should not have remove any peice of literature of any sort from the shelves.  This is cleary a problem that the individuals themselves should be accountable to get over and realize the obvious fact that no one person is checking books out just to offend them as an individual. They are the ones having the problem so they should be the ones that have to work hard to not get offended over these small very minor occurances simply because someone is reading something that happened years ago. It is our job to fix this problem if we are the ones getting offended not the libraries"	7168	7169
5074	2	"I believe that most of books,music,movies,magazines,etc.,can be removed because some of them just aren't right or need to be exposed to these young children.The movies that come out now that kids and teenagers go see or either very explicit or unrated for them to be seeing.It goes for all of the items I named because magazines explicit some of the music is explicit very vulnerable for young adults and kids minds in this generation.    Many kids see a lot of bad things in thier life.Then how our enviroment is now well community then we have these bad movies and crazy rap song etc.By that there influencing them more by going out to do unormal things that they are not use to doing.I say bad influence is taking a major toll in this generation and looks like it cant be stopped which it can.     My opinion is what @CAPS1 sticking with most magazines and movies and some music etc, should be removed.They just makin it worst for our future that we are trying to come in to or to be something in life.If nothing do get removed then thats just life I believe they want to remove them but their mostly in it for the money so thier not going to stop."	7170	7171
5075	2	"Alrighty then I really don't have a hole lot of experience with offensive stuff because well how to put this nicely, I don't care. If that offeneds you I'm truely sorry but I have reasons not to care. If something is offensive ok @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Back to my reasons I have a total @NUM1 reasons and one way we both can win a litle bit.      My first reason is simpal, if you think something is offensive then don't get @CAPS2. Let some one who might like @CAPS2 chek @CAPS2 out, buy @CAPS2, or whatever the options are. Not everyone shairs the same view on @CAPS2 whatever @CAPS2 is.      My second reason isn't as simpal as my last one, if some one is working one a paper and they are reserching something that was marked as OFFENSIVE then well they just lost a realy good reliabal resors didn't they. Now I'm not saying that evryone has done a paper on someting Offensive but some people have and more will, so make @CAPS2 easer on them ceep the offensive stuff.     Now my idea so everyone will shut up for once. Move all the 'offensive stuff' to another room. There you go no more problems. See now you don't have to wery about not having a book or a kid grabing a 'colorful' book every one is happy.     Alrighty then I hope this helps in the long run.

5076	2	"Don't take the books off the shelf, @CAPS1 people read different kind of books. To lean off of. If the book is bad, then have an age limit. That would help with the kids that get there hands on those kinds of books. @CAPS1 parents @MONTH1 want there kid to read thoes kinds of books. It all depends on how old the kid is.           If the book/magazines are that bad then take them off, but somepeople maybe asking for it. It's good to keep the reader happy, if libraries takes those kinds of books off, then those people @MONTH1 stop coming to that libaries. Soon they will go under and have to close. Keep books, magazines, etc.. on the shelf.          @CAPS1 of them @MONTH1 help parents talk to there kids. Then the kid will know how to be careful and not to get into anything bad. It all depends on the parents. But don't take those items off the shelf. It's importan to have them where the people can look, and lean, @CAPS2 quite and peaceful.           Most libraries don't take materials off the shelf, because it's importan for the people. Most kids don't like talking to there parents about things, so they @MONTH1 go to the libraries and lean there. It @MONTH1 also help them talk to there parents. If they try to get a movie, they would have to be atleast @NUM1 to beable to see they movie. So it will help them from seeing something they shouldn't.

5077	2	"Libraries were made for the public; therefore, the public should be the ones deciding what should be in the libraries, right? I believe so. But should we exclude material from the library based on censorship? That's a different story.      Books, music, movies, and magazines all have to go through some sort of editing and publishing process to make sure the work is wholesome for its audience. That means that not every movie is made for a young audience, and not every book is made for an adult audience. That's what can make some materials not appopriate for younger audiences. Material with offensive language, violence, or ideas are the things people want to censor. But what if an adult wants to read a book with offensive language, but another mother censors the book for her child's sake and the book goes off the shelf? That's where censoring problems can start. Through my observations, I've found that everyone has different interests, and different ideas about what's 'good' or 'bad.' So how would we be able to censor things when everyone has different ideas? The truth is: we can't. The @CAPS1 tried to censor books in the @NUM1's, but even that has proven to destroy instead of conquer. It has to be up to the reader or their parents to decide, based on their age. Although I wish we could take materials off the shelf that give people bad ideas, or doesn't give them a good moral off the shelf like Katherine Paterson, but it would be almost impossible to do. But there are already great materials set in place to help us decide on a material in the library, and it's as easy as just using the internet. One thing we already have a great system for using is: ratings. Ratings help decide if something is appropriate for a certain audience. That doesn't mean it can't be found in a child's hands some way, but it gives adults a great standard to at least regard. Another way we have already censored is through reviews. If you want a certain book but you're not sure about whether or not it's appropriate, you can always go to the internet and read a review on it. It's the same for music, movies and more.      Based on my experience and observations, I've found that we should not try to censor materials in libraries anymore than we already have. Keeping certain materials in different areas of the library is already a great system set in place, and if we keep up with systems like that, I feel like that's a good place to be. Trying to take materials off the shelf for children's sake could make some adults upset that their favorite material is no longer there. So I don't believe we should remove any materails from libraries unless they are so vulgar that no one in society should ever see it, hear it, or read it. Censoring everything would end up just like @CAPS2's plan: in failure"	7176	7177

Kids now days are learning what stuff means just like that and you give them a book just like the ones that have cuz words in them, or over a @NUM1 one they are going to know what that means, And that is not a good thing at all.

5079	2	Books and movies and magazines are some kind of things you can find in a libary. But some people think that there are some of them are offensive.They think that they should be taken off the shelf.         From my own observations i think  people have a right in the community to choose there own stuff to read and watch. But I do think that the cds should be censored so there are no cruse words in them. Movies on the othere hand should be only for people who are in a certain age group. For instiance if you are ten and you want to get a @NUM1 movie I thing that the libary should say no and put the movie back.  If you are @NUM2 I think you should be able to get any movie you want that the libary has.     Books are a diffrent thing. Not all the libarys read all the books they put on the shelfs and they shouldnt have too.  Magazines are diffrent on my point of veiw. There should be two diffrent sections for magazines. One for the kids @NUM3 and older and the othere for younger kids. They also need to seprat all the books with unaproate languge and kids books. So that would help a lot of libarys out with there books and magazines.     I think that the censorship in libarys should be one movies and cds. Books are a whole another thing. What kids do you know at the age of @NUM4 picking a book with out piturs? I don't know any and I dont thing there will ever be any kids like that. So my oppinion is yes and no at the same time. Censor some stuff and not all of it.	7180	7181
5080	2	"What would you call offensive? On the top of your head there's racism, bad language, sexual content, etc. But if you broke it down into what every single person thought was offensive the list would contain everything there is other than rainbows and nap time.     If people tried to censor a library all that would be left are a couple of books in the kiddy section.    Lets say a child went to the library and checked out a book about vampires and witches,who comes from a strict religous family, of course the parents are going to get upset. To them its offensive because such creatures are a slide against god. If we were to remove those books from the library, the kids who's parents didn't mind would take offense to just the action, and probably retaliate with removing all religeous pieces, and so on and so fourth. All and all not a good outcome for anybody.    People should keep in mind that most libraries already have systems in place. Such as sectioning off certain areas  like adults, teens, kids. and in those sorting the writing types.    We already have a good system. I see no need to start taking books off the shelf because someone else thought the material offensive. Not everyone thinks or feels the same. If you don't approve of a book and you don't want your child to check it out then monitor they're rentals, don't ruin it for the rest"	7182	7183
5081	2	"Is it wrong to take books,music,movies and magazines out of the libary? I believe it is because if it is to grafic for certain ages dont let them use it.     Music can be a very good tool in class projects. Such as doing a slide show and you get a song to express you point or add to it.You can do various thing with music then just enjoy it as a passtime. Kids could listen to music during there free time and help them relax or blow off some steam.     Books and Magazines are very bentifical to kids learning. Reading about something they enjoy can broaden there vocabulary and help them have a good passtime. They will choose there books and magazines they are interested in. Some books and magazines that questionable about being offensive should be booked marked and have to have parental permission to check that book out. This way the students that are mature enough to read these subjects will still be able to enjoy them without them being banded or taken out.     Movies are different for all mature or young ages. Movies can be very educational and a different way to learn rather than a book if it isn't to distracting for the viewers. Movies are great for kids that dont quiet get the book or cant follow the book. These films seem to catch there attetion and they watch and enjoy to learn about the subject more.     Books, Music,Movies and Magazines should remain in the libary. The more mature books should just be taken and put in a different section and have to have parental permision to look at or check them out."	7184	7185
5082	2	"Do I think that books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelf. No, I dont because you are still going to hear people swear and do different things that are not appropriate. So why take them off the shelf if they are not going to change people from doing or saying inappropriate things.     For example, when I was very young I started to learn right from wrong. But I also learned what a lot of wrong things was. Like when people swore I knew it was a sign of anger or in some cases it was just talking to your friends. I also knew when people got into fight that it was wrong but entertaining. My mom would always tell me you hear and see these things, but it doesnt mean you have to do it. With that I want to say you can read and listen to things that are inappropriate and offensive but you should @CAPS1 from the lessons you learned when you are little to not immatate.     In addition to that, if you take these books off the shelves, alot of teens and children might not read anymore books. These are the type of books that keep kids entertained. If you take them off the shelf, what are kids going to have to read. I @CAPS1 from personal experience these are the only type off books I read. I dont like reading books that are not interesting I rather read a book that I can relate to and that I won't want to fall asleep while reading.     Although, they might be write about books and music having a influence on them. They should still @CAPS1 right from wrong and not immatate what is in books or movies. Its not like the books or the movies are telling you to do these things. Kids choose to do them because they think it is cool or they think everybody else is doing this. Kids might even think that just because the rapper and actors are saying it then it must be right. But use your judgement, whats right and whats wrong to you.     In conclusion, I just want to finish off by saying dont take the books off the shelf. Let kids pick and choose what they want to read. Let them figure out if they are going to do the right thing or not. Don't be the judge of what they want to read. They will make the right choice."	7186	7187

Books, music, movies, and magazines were all written the way they were for a reason, to convey a message, and with censorship, that message becomes lost.     Censorship can be found everywhere. On @CAPS1, cuss words are bleeped out. In school libraries, books that portray offensive ideas, or contain thoughts and nature that are considered too complex or offensive for children are removed. On the radio, swear words are removed from songs. Some people believe that censorship is needed to protect people, children especially, from explicit content that they beilieve will harm them or influence bad behavior. However, what is really being blocked by censorship are people's ideas, and the reality that exists not only in today's world, but the relaities of the past as well. What's really being censored is the truth.          There is little doubt that the arguement of whether or not cenorship is benficial or detrimental will continue on for quite some time. Some people will remain adamant that censorship is essential to protect children, and promote good manners and behavior. This however, is clearly not the case as was discussed. As long as censorship continues in libraries and all throughout society, the truth and reality will remain locked away from children. It will be kept away from them until they become old enough to realize and undertand what's been hidden from them.What some can't come to realize, is that through censorship, progress is being hindered, and the truth is being covered with lies. What some people can't come to understand, is that by promoting censorship in libraries and society, they are truly just censoring themselves"	7188	7189
5084	2	"I believe that books, magazines,movies,music, etc., should not be taken off the shelves because some people might find them 'offensive'. Because that wouldn't be fare for the other people that might not find that kind of stuff offensive.                    Yeah, there might be stuff out there that might really be offensive to some but no one is telling them to read it, watch it, or listen to it. Now if there was somethings that were really offensive they wouldn't put it on the shelf in the first place.                For example, this lady rented the movie '@PERSON1' for her younger son and she watched it with him and the movie had blood and a nudity scene in it. The woman was mad and took back demanding her money back and for them to get rid of the movie. Well, first of all she should have got the boy the @CAPS1 version of '@PERSON1' where he can relate to it more because it's a cartoon, second, she should have read in the back of the box of what's in the movie and what it's rated instead of blaming the people who she rented it off of.     Not every book,movie,music, or magazine is bad or offensive. Some people just try to find something wrong with it so they can get attention off of it. Another example is the '@CAPS2'. This book has been around for thousands of years! People find it offensive because they say it's 'a lie, or there is no such thing as heaven or hell, or it's about a guy getting killed because his father loved us', if people carry a @CAPS2 on them because they want to it's ok for them to or if it's in the library, others freak out. If you are walking around with a @CAPS4 book and that person with the @CAPS2 does not find it offensive or if they don't care then you should'nt neither.           Parents, if you don't want your child to get anything bad, watch what they get! Get the movies or music for them, teach them right from wrong. Just don't blame the people that put it on the shelves at stores or libraries because they are only doing their jobs."	7190	7191
5085	2	"When I was a child, I would walk through various rows of books until I found a book that best suited me. I enjoyed the thought of an adventure to find a good book. Wiping dusty books clean after pulling them off of a shelf. I loved the thought of traveling all over the world through the writings of different exciting authors. I beleive that books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from libraries. A library is a place where people of all ages can come and find something that interests them. Books affect people in different ways. They can teach a person about the history of civilizations or they can teach a person about the difference between right and wrong. They can change that person's life.     In my experiences, when I went to the library, I would check out any book I though appeasing and take it home. When I started reading books with super natural topics, I started to think outside the box. Books that allowed me to have an adventure could be considered offensive to sheltered people. The first time I picked up a book with monsters in it, I actually enjoyed reading. I started reading book after book. Even though these books could have been found strange or offensive, my vocabulary and need to learn grew quickly. If it wasn't for those books, I would never want to become an author to help inspire others to learn.     Books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but they also give knowledge to others. Just as reading about topics -like slavery- could offend or teach people about @CAPS1 history. Not only do books help expand a child's brain through building thought, but they give a child their own personality. People should be able to not only think for themselves, but to like certain topics.     Books with bad topics are also good for readers. When I was growing up, I would read stories on wars and other things with violent natures. With reading these stories, I discovered how people should act. I learned about the mistakes of people, so I wouldn't make the mistakes that happened years ago. I learned about how to treat others. I was taught, through reading, about not making the mistakes of others. With that, I learned obedience and kindness.      Music could be another topic of interest for the censorship in libraries. Music is a great way for people of all ages to connect to something. While listening to music, people get ideas for not only stories, but paintings and other career paths. Music is a place where people can feel they belong. There are so many genres, that people can find a sound that is appeasing to them. One person could relate to a song about growing up on a farm compared to a person that enjoys connecting to a song about the broken hearted.     In libraries, everyone should have the choice on what to read or to listen to. The ability to choose makes people who they are. It gives them a personality. With reading, people learn about histories. The reader can also learn about mistakes and help to correct them. Music, as well as stories, give people something to connect to. This allows people of all ages to belong somewhere.The different genres allow people to be themselves and to care about others"	7192	7193
5086	2	"Walking into a library, the librarians tell you to stay quiet and  to look throughout the library and find some books that intrest you.  If the library doesn't have the book or books you're looking for, they will ask if a neighboring library does.  So why do people say that material in the libraries can be offensive?  Because they look at what they enjoy and a book, a song, a magazine, or a movie that has a curse words and sexual scenes in it is not what they want to see, read, or hear.  Although some materials are found offensive in libraries, they should not be removed because people have the choice to read, listen, and watch what they want to.     All libraries are split into three main sections.  There's the children's section, the teenager's section, and the adult's section.  If a library has movies, then they are usually all together, but they are split up into ratings as well.  Usually people don't see a little child walking away with a stack of adult books, and teenagers might reflect on what they read when they were little, but they get tired of the repetition.  Every age group wants something new and that's why writers keep writing.  When a person gets to a certain age, they can graduate to a new set of books.  It's their choice to read what they want.     Someone is listening to a really good @CAPS1 that they got from the library.  They start dancing around and having a good time.  All of a sudden they hear this very offensive line in the song.  They realize all the songs have one line in them that is horrible.  So they take it back and never get it again.  It's the same way with a book, magazine, or movie.  If a person doesn't like it, then they can just take it back to the library.  It was free to check it out so they didn't waste their money on something new and find out that they didn't like it.  Libraries get new things in quite often so there has to be something everyone can enjoy.  If a person is offended by what they read, heard, or saw, then they can take the item back and never check it out again.  It's their choice.     Looking through all the genres of books get's kind of tiring.  However, if you know what you want, then that can make it easier.  A @CAPS2 person possibly would not want a book that talks about murder, drugs, sex, and other things like that.  That might offend them.  So if they really wanted something good, they should find a book that doesn't talk about those kind of things.  It might take some time to find something that they enjoy, but it's worth it if you can go tell your friends that these kinds of books are really good and they don't have bad things in them.  If a person gets offended by what they see or read, then switch the genres you're looking for.  It's really not that hard.     Libraries are supposed to have books, movies, magazines, and music that everyone can enjoy.  Just because someone doesn't like what they checked out, doesn't mean that everyone else agrees with that person.  If they aren't interested in anything the library has to offer, then they should just go write their own book, create their own movie, or make their own songs.  Libraries shouldn't have to take things out because people are offended.  The people should just look for things they are interested in and everyone will be happy."	7194	7195
5087	2	"In today's flourishing society, the media plays a huge role in the way we all view the world.  The media allows people to see through another person's eyes and understand their point of view.  Many people make and listen to music to help them deal with stress or just so that their voices don't go unheard.  Fictional books and movies draw men, women, and children into a new world and stretch their imaginations beyond measure.  For a moment, imagine if the freedoms of an artist were limited.  Take a second to think about what it would be like if we lived in a world where creativity was strongly discouraged.  Libraries are an outlet for many adults and children.  However, a library full of empty shelves is useless to everyone.     Censorship is the removal of offensive material.  Let's take a moment to define offensive.  Offensive is anything insulting or undersirable, right?  However, the opinion of what is offensive and what is not often varies.  So, does that mean that we should remove all materials from a library that @MONTH1 be considered offensive?  Absolutely not!  @PERSON1 said it best, 'and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The entire idea of censorship is biased and unconstitutional.      Writers jot down what's in their heads.  Journalist analyze what they see.  Musicians create melodies out of their experiences.  Actors potray roles that writers have envisioned for them.  Who should have the ability to completely remove the works of the innovative and creative people of this world?  According to the @ORGANIZATION1, no one does.  All @CAPS1 have rights which include freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  No man can take those rights away from another man.  Therefore, every individual should be allowed to let their abilities shine through without being censored.       As @CAPS1, we see censorship everyday such as bleeping out curse word on radio and television.  We live in a society where we are required to meet the status quo and always be politically correct.  This is a reasonable and sometimes necessary norm.  Consequently, for every norm there is always a rebel there to break it.  If it weren't for these revolutionary rebels we wouldn't live in the free nation that we are in today.  So, we must not silence their voices.  Instead, people must allow others to say, write, and do what they feel if it does not harm others.  Continual censorship and neglect of new ideas will only hurt everyone in the long run.  Imagine if @ORGANIZATION2's paintings were never seen because of censorship laws.  What if @ORGANIZATION3's writing was never read because they it was considered 'offensive'.  The media is oftentimes a device used for making history and no one should be allowed to stop that.     Instead of taking materials out of libraries that are 'offensive', leave them there.  Someone else might find them inspiring.  Do not request that something be censored for the sake of the children, just keep the children away from it.  Kids will only do what you allow them.  Be intelligent.  Think about how you would feel if someone told you that you couldn't be expressive or creative.  No change or innovation will ever come if we block our minds to the beauty happening around us."	7196	7197
5088	2	"Do you believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that they should be removed from the shelves if they are inappropriate for anyone of a certain age. I have read many books, listen to music, watched movies, and seen magazines that have inappropriate material in it and I know that children can get a hold of them. Many people say that they have the right to read, watch, or listen to any thing they want but young children can also. There are different reasons why some people want those kinds of material off the shelves.     One of the reasons why I believe that offensive material should be taken off the shelves is because many children that read or see the material will think that it is alright for them to do those things too. Many children and teens are doing things that will hurt or might even kill them, such as drugs and shoplifting. If the children see that it is alright to do these things because they read it in a book or saw it in a movie, will make the world a worse place to live. Children will do what they see and most of it is coming from movies or books that they found on the shelf at a store.     Another reason is that parents do not want there kids to hear or see what inappropriate of offensive things that are happening in books and in movies. Parents want there children to the right thing and not terrible things that they take off the shelf at a store. The parents also teach there children from saying things that are wrong but the children can't learn not to say them because they hear it or see it everyday. Many parents are protective of there children and don't want them to take the wrong path in life because of something they saw or heard of when they were younger.     Taking these offensive and inappropriate materials off the shelf can also help fix problems for adults. Adults hear or see something and automatically give their opinion on the situation. They see movies and television shows on killing and drugs that people get away with and they think that they can get away with it also. Seeings, hearing, or watching offensive things can cause problems by making fights among different people. One person might believe that it wasn't inappropriate and another might think it is and it causes more problems with it.     In my opinion I believe that inappropriate and offensive material should be taken off of the shelves. It will help children from seeing or hearing inappropriate things, make parents happy, and give adults a chance not to fight. Having seen and heard what I've heard I beleive it's the right thing to do. Taking this type of material off the shelf will make the world a less offensive place to live."	7198	7199
5089	2	"Censorship is something that fills our everyday lives. Some books and magazines are not meant for a little kid to read. This is why some books and magazines have been censored so that the little kids will not read the curse words. I believe that all people have the freedom to choose what is right for them and their family. Depending on if it is for or against censorship, that is the person's decision.       I think books in libraries that are found offensive should not be removed from the book shelves. This is because everyone has the right to read or listen to what they want. If a parent does not want their kids to read books that are offensive, they should help the kids pick out a book that is suitable for them to read. Authors also have the freedom to write a book what ever way they want to write it. People that really care about the problem should just learn to ignore it.     If parents do not want their kids reading certain books that @MONTH1 be offensive to other people or themselves, they should be looking for that. I believe that if parents truly care about what their kids are reading then they should realize exactly what the kids are reading. Music is also in our everyday lives. However, sometimes parents can not help what thier kids listen to, such as music. In this case I think all types of music should be censored on all radio stations. If the kids really want to hear all the curse words, they should have the right to go and buy the uncensored version of the songs.     I believe that all types of music, books, magazines, and movies that are in the pubilc, for public uses, should all be censored. If someone is at home reading a book I do not think it should have to be censored because this is the book that the person wanted to read. Authors should not be punished for how they want to write their own story. Everyone should have a choice to decide what they want for their family, and themselves. I have noticed that if we make our own decisions, we tend to do what is best for ourselves."	7200	7201
5090	2	"There are all kinds of entertainment in our libraries today. Many things in which not everyone @MONTH1 agree with. Certain books, magazines, movies, or music should not have to be taken off of the shelves of the libraries if they @MONTH1 be offensive to another. Everyone has the freedom and right to read, watch, and listen to what interests them.     There are many things in the world that people can control. Having to control the information or entertainment that is being put in libraries is a little over the top. Many books about religions and different views are displayed at the library. People @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with the books being diplayed. Just because there @MONTH1 be a book or magazine in the library that @CAPS5 @MONTH1 not agree with, however, does not mean they have the right to get rid of it. Different people have different opinions and views on aspects of the world. If a person finds something offensive in the library they should be able to ignore it and move on. A @CAPS1 family @MONTH1 come into the library and want to read a book about their religion to enhance their knowledge on their faith. If a @CAPS2 librarian did not believe in that religion or think that @CAPS3 is wrong, they @MONTH1 want to take @CAPS1 books out of the library. If a person does not belive in something it does not necessarily mean that it is wrong.The reason why there are so many different books, magazines, songs, and movies, etc., in the world is because there are many different people in the world. Everyone has different morals, values, and beliefs. If variety was taken away in the world it would not be interesting.      Katherine Paterson said, '...But I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 @MONTH1 be able to take what they believe to be offensive off the shelf, but it would not be right. It @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but @MONTH1 not be to another who comes walking along looking for that book or magazine. Therefore, offensive movies, music, magazines, etc., should not have to be taken off the shelves of the libraries. The libraries would be boring and everyone would have to be interested in the same thing. The library would not be the place to come to be entertained anymore."	7202	7203
5091	2	"Censorship in libraries is not a good idea. Children should read what they want. They need to develope a personal style. Would you want to be censored in what you read?      Therefore, If libraries took all the books that would be considered 'harmful' then there would not be enough books to consider it a library. Children need to develope their own sense of 'right and wrong'. There would be no religious text in a library, due to the fact that there are offensive material throughout. Fiction would have to be cleaned up, and what is the fun in that? Historical documents, they would have entirely to much violence.     Next, people make decisions all the time, children need to too. If a parent does not want his/her child to read a book, then they need to sit down and have a conversation about why the child should not read that book. Parents should let their children have a say in what they read. Parents do not need to inforce their ways of thinking on their child. Let the child decide for themselves. Reading is a healthy way of gaining knowledge.      Futhermore, if a book is concidered 'harmful' and taken out of a library, a child is not getting that chance to enjoy, or learn from that book. Knowledge is power, so do not take away a childs chance at gaining power. When a child reads, they absorb the life lessons and the adventures all these books have to offer. Some children @MONTH1 take a book and choose what to do later in life, whether that is a good or bad thing is up to them.      In conclusion, books should not be censored. It is wrong to take away a chance at knowledge for anyone. Children need to develope style, not be like everyone else. Reading is that chance to be different. Do not censore your children, let them live and learn."	7204	7205
5092	2	"Cole @CAPS1 @NUM1 @NUM2                     @CAPS2 @CAPS3 On Censorship in Libraries          @CAPS4 people think that certain books shouldn't be in libraries. Well, everyone is going to have a book that they don't like. If we were to let everyone take out the books that they don't like then we would have no more books and no more libraries.      One book that I have read that is controversial is ''To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6''. This book has to do with racism, rape, and the @ORGANIZATION1. Every person and or child should know about these things and how @CAPS7 delt with those issues at the time. If you took the book away we wouldn't have it to understand or learn from.       Another type of book would be like an instructional book. Instructional books teach us how to do something or know how to do it better. If they were to take these books away then we wouldn't be able to do certain things or teach other people how to do it.     Another source would be magazines.  Many people enjoy reading  magazines. Magazines are all different, and have certain things that people enjoy. Everyone has a different opinion on what they enjoy, and no one has the right to make that decision for the group as a whole.     This is why I believe that books should not be taken from libraries; for the content of the book, for the learning purposes and  so everyone can learn about histoy"	7206	7207
5093	2	"Should that book, movie, or @CAPS1 be removed from the shelf? I don't think they should be removed just because certain people don't like them. There are some people out there that like those kinds of romance or killing novels or movies. If this kind of thing is going to happen it needs to go through some sort of agreement or vote. I personally don't think they should be removed from the shelves.     If you don't want your kids to see that kind of thing then don't let them. It is that simple. You are in charge of what they can and can't look at and if you don't want them watching that kind of movie, reading that kind of book, or listening to that kind of music then you have to right to make sure it isn't in your kids life. There are some parents that don't mind if their child is exposed to that kind of stuff and to me that is there choice. Don't take the enjoyment from someone just because you don't like something that someone has done.     Also if you yourself doesn't want to have that kind of stuff in your life then you don't have to buy it or expose yourself to it either. You are an adult and you are in charge of yourself so you can make those decisions by yourself. Nobody is picking up the material and saying you have to buy this or you will go to jail. It is totally up to you. I don't see why things should  change just because some certain people don't like it. Once again you are in charge of yourself and if you choose not to like it then okay and if you do choose to like it then that is completely fine with me also.     A personal experience I have had with this kind of thing was when I was about @NUM1 and I was in the library. There was this adult that took a book up to the front counter and yelled and complained because her child had picked up a book that she thought was completely inappropriate for the child to have. This again comes back to what I was saying earlier, if you don't want your child to look at that kind of thing then you need to monitor what they are doing more closely and make sure that they don't look at it or try to to look at it. That is exactly what the librarian told the lady. I have always lived by this kind of thing and that is what I have told people who have problems with it.     I don't think that materials should be removed from the shelves because people don't like them. If people don't like it they don't have to buy it or look at it. If they don't want their kids to look at it or read it, then they shouldn't let their kids look at it or read it. These are some reasons I don't think books should be taken off the shelves because people think that they are inappropriate."	7208	7209
5094	2	"I disagree with removing some books, music, movies and magazines that are found offensive in a library. As a student, a library is a very helpful place to find resources. Books, music, movies and even magazines are wonderful resources to learn about the past or the present.     Libraries have a wide selection of books, music, movies and magazines that educate me and other students with history from the past. History is very important part of our lives because it awares us of past events that took place many years ago such as teaching us that @PERSON1 discovered the new world or finding vaccines for diseases or even that @PERSON2 was the @NUM1 @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1 that ended slavery.Removing part of that selection because it was found offensive wouldn't let us be aware of all the facts that history has to offer.      Books, music, movies and magazines don't only help educate students on the past but they also help educate students with the present. Today, they're are many things in @LOCATION2 that is changing such as @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being the first @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1. Not only is @LOCATION2 changing though, things all around the world are changing. With out books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be aware of the world and how it is changing.     Libraries also help me and other students study. With the wide selection the library has to offer I can easily find a book relating to my studies. With taking out some of the library's wide slection of books, music, movies, or magazines, I wouldn't be able to find one as easily.      If libraries were to remove some books, music, movies, and magazines that were found offensive we would be without some of the resources used today. Books, music, movies and magazines help me and other students study and help educate us on the past and the present"	7210	7211
5095	2	"Do you get offended easily? There are many offensive things anywhere you go.      I believe that if you get offended easily then dont read books or magazines that offend you. Libraries shouldn't take certain materials off their selves because most of that stuff intrests people and keeps them coming back for more. Costomers should know that there will be offensive material in libraries and if there is then don't read it. If libraries took all their 'offensive' material off their selves less people will probably return to that library.     When i read something offensive, it makes me want to prove that person wrong.  I learn from what i read and that's what people should do more often. They shouldn't make the libraries take that material off their selves just because they can't show the world that they are strong enough to handle it.     Libraries would be more interesting if they had a bigger varity, including 'offensive' material. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to a different person. Therefore, removing that material from the selves @MONTH1 make people mad because they don't get offended when they read it.     Be strong when you read offensive material. Learn from the material, show the world that you can hadle it, and try to prove them wrong. Libraries shouldn't have to take material off their selves if it might be offensive because it would make life less interesting."	7212	7213
5096	2	"Books, movies, music, and magazines come in many different shapes and forms.  Some are child friendly.  Many of them though, are not.  This is a problem becouse only movies and some music have criticts who talk about them.  Even if the movie or book sounds child friendly it @MONTH1 not be.      I love to read and watch movies.  Sometimes however I will read a book and it will be bad or unsutable for children.  This to me seems like a problem, becouse not all parents will tell their child that they cannot read the book or see the movie.  So this might seem like books, if not sutable for children, should not be in a book store or library.       I have seen my friends at the age of ten go to @CAPS1 rated movies.  I was never alowed to and I am glad my parents did not let me.  But it is their parents choice if they want their children to see the movie or read the bad book.  I do not think it is good but anyone can see it if their parents let them.     When i was younger i saw a @NUM1 movie and it was very raunchy and rude.  I was embaresed I saw it.  Then ten @CAPS2 later i learned my eleven year old cousin saw it.  I felt that was a bad a bad choice my aunt had, but she did not want him to be sheltered from the outside world.  She had her reason and it was a valid one at that.       I do not think that we should be alowed to take anyones right to see a movie away if they want to and they are alowed too.  If they do not think it is a good choice of movie for them to see then they wont see it.  If another man does than they should be alowed to see it.  Not all movies are a good choice for me to see.  Even when I am thirty some movies @MONTH1 still not be good for me to see.       If a mom does not care if her ten year old son viewes an @CAPS1 rated movie so be it.  They should not be allowed to remove books, movies, or anythiong else from shelves, becouse someone made that book to entertain you and they are hoping to make a living off of the book.  If we get rid of it they cannot make a living off of it.  Besides we have freedom to choose what we do and what we do not want to see.  This is how I feel on removeing books movies magazines, etc.  We should have the choice if we do or do not see or read the movie or book, and not have to worried about it being removed"	7214	7215
5097	2	"No, i do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone should have the same right to read, listen, or watch what they want to. Yes some thing @MONTH1 not be in the age group intended for that person but they should have the right to read a book or listen to something if they want to.     Some parents think that there children should not be exposed to some things like violence and stuff because they will want to go and do bad thing because of what they see in the movie and what actors are doing and that is not entirely true. Yes there are some bad stuff in some movies, books, and magazines but maby children can learn from what they see in them. Also if parents will not let there children watch the movie they want to, or read the book they want to, then whos to say they wont go and do it with the parent not knowing about it. I would rather know what my child is doing and if they are going to read are watch something bad with violence then i would want to explane to them that it is very bad to do things like that and talk about it with them.     I think that if a child finds a book that looks intersting to them and they want to learn more about it then they should be able to because not alot of kids want to read in the first place. books can help teach children things and help them be better readers and understand things better. So no i dont think that some books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelf because it can help them learn more about things"	7216	7217

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and etc., should be removed from the shelves?      No, materials such as books, music, magazines, or movies, should'nt be removed. No matter what people say, do, or write should put you down. As people cried' @CAPS1 a rumor', then they should leave it alone. Yes, correct it if you get offensive and if @CAPS1 not true. But at the same time understand as you get older you will have people that dislikes you. That will throw dirt on your name.     The libraries should not remove the materials from the shelves, because outsiders get offensive. Many authors express theirsevles differently then other authors. Also, you have to undersatnd everyone is different. Some authors @MONTH1 have somethings in common. But not always, and thats what you have to remeber.     So, as you have read my article, hope you strongly believe and take key to what I have said. You should'nt worry about what others say about you, because whats comes around goes around. Authors should not have their books tooken off of the shelves because of their opions."	7218	7219

5100	2	"My @CAPS1, for Censorship in Libraries @CAPS2, i think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because if they are at a local @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it will not be prohibited for @ORGANIZATION1 use because of the state law. And again i do not believe they should remove certain books from the libary shelves because students love to read books of course in like to get into magazines, sports books, etc.Everyone likes to read different kind of books there are many things people love to do besides reading a book I dont even know why, they should remove the books from local places because what if there wasn't any books in the libaries there would be nothing for students to look at or even read by all the expectations iv'e seen going on at @ORGANIZATION1 to tell you the truth i don't think there should be any @ORGANIZATION1 rules at ''NO @ORGANIZATION1''. that's why the @ORGANIZATION2 should let me run for president if i was and charge of anything only thing people would have to pay for is @CAPS3,@CAPS4, Etc. From my experience, i do not believe magazines,books,materials should be taken off of shelves"	7222	7223
5101	2	"Freedom of speech is one of our most important rights as @CAPS1. Censorship in books, music, movies, and magazines is going against that right that we @CAPS1 should hold near and dear. Censorship in libraries break this right as well, @CAPS3 should contain materials for all ages, not only children go to these libraries to check out different forms of media.     Libraries should dived sections according to age and content in the material that can be checked out. Children should have an area with books, music, and films that are age appropriate, and they should not be allowed to check out things that don't fall into their age group.This can also be done with films and literature for older people who want to check things out from their library. Having an age divison in the library could take care of the worry of your children reading something you don't want them to.     Censorship in books and films should not be allowed in this free country were living in. Every person has the right to their ideas, and to put them out there for the public to read, or watch if they so choose. People should know what their getting into when picking up a novel or film just by looking at it. If you are offened by anything that the movie, or novel is portraying, don't read or watch it. We as @CAPS1 in the world we live in now should be more open to things, or shrug them off. The idea of censoring an author or director is un-@CAPS5 to me, and it should be for you as well.     In conclusion, Libraries don't need to censor books or films. Libraries should offer people choices on what media they want to partake in, and set limits for what an age group should be exposed to. Censorship in this country is wrong no matter how you look at it. We all have the right to express our ideas and views openly."	7224	7225
5102	2	"I think that some stuff that contains offensive language should be remove from shelves because adults can find them aggresive or inappropiate for their children but some of them should not be remove because they contain information about relationships, sex and other materials that you can use.Some information in magazines, books, movies etc. could be used to show the children how important a relationship could be and also to prevent many infections that can be transmitted when you have sex.Many kids who are in a relationship do not know anything about sex because they feel embarrased and they do not want to ask to their parents or teachers so if we take off materials that contain all that information they will never know anything about sex or relationships and they @MONTH1 face many obstacles in their lifes.A lot of people died annualy because they got infections for having sex with other people who got @CAPS1 or other diseases thay @MONTH1 cause dead.Also if you want to have sex you should @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or go to the doctor and check that you do not have any disease that @MONTH1 transmit to the other person.A good conclusion for this is that parents should talk with their kids about sex and how dangerous can be if you get an infection as @CAPS1 also if you have sex use protection there are many forms to @CAPS3 @CAPS4.Think positive and ask your parents about sex and relationships and @CAPS3 @CAPS4"	7226	7227
5103	2	"In a world where we would all agree, no book would ever need to be taken off the shelf. With society now a days everyone has an opinion. Sometimes bad and sometimes good but there are three main reasons why I believe that no necessary steps need to taken to rid oursleves of materials like books, movies, and magazines such as personal opinions, education, and choices.      First, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. While you @MONTH1 find something offensive other people @MONTH1 not. Is it fair to everyone else that they @MONTH1 no longer enjoy something just because you didn't? I believe that if that was the case...the world would be very poor and we would have nothing. People should not base big decisions such as the removal of materials without taking into consideration how they make other people feel.     Second, something that almost all of us are recieveing now is an education. Thinking about those things you @MONTH1 like, what we should also be focusing on is how they are affecting our lives in a good way. Through experiences and knowledge we get a better understanding of life. This will also help us learn about situations and life in general. If we take those oppotunities away, we are losing those opportunities and we will not be as rich as kowledge as we would be with them.      Third, everyone in the world is free to make their own choices. Guaranteed unless you are over the age of @NUM1 you @MONTH1 not be completely free however you can make your own decision to do something. Such as to read a certain article or write a paper that @MONTH1 be seen as cruel and so forth. If you are not okay with something then you should feel free to make the choice not to participate in that, however; some people would still like to enjoy that particular thing. You either choose to participate in something or you do not.     As great as it is to be entitled to your own opinion we must take into consideration everyone else's opinions. We need to learn that we are not the only ones in the world and that everyone is affected by things in different ways. Especially when we could benefit and be persuaded by changes such as opinions, education, and choices. I'll never want an opportunity taken away from me...are you willing to take away someone else's oppotunity?"	7228	7229
5104	2	"As the people of the @LOCATION1, we are granted several rights that no one or no law can ever take away from us. One of  those rights is freedom of speech. When it comes to the subject of censorship in libraries, I feel that this matter violates the right that was giving to us by our forefathers.     Censorship is already something that we see everyday. From the television that we watch to the music that we listen to, every part of the media world has a form of censorship in some sort of way. Personally, I feel that putting censor limits on things takes away from the orginality and creativity from the artist. The reason that a person writes a book, or creates a song is to express their feelings without someone telling them that it is not suitable for the listening public.     As a child, I always felt that the library was a place you could go to and learn anything you wanted anytime you wanted. For someone to judge if a certain book can be published or not be put on shelves is ridiculous to me. Its a clear solution to this problem however; if you don't like the subject matter of a book, don't pick it up! This also applies to movies,tv,and other visual entertainment. No one ever forced anyone to go see a movie that they had no interest viewing or felt was offensive.     When a company comes out with a product, each product is made to reach a certain demographic. It is unfair for a @NUM1 year old @ORGANIZATION1 official to censor a music video that was created to entertain a @NUM2 year old male. America has to stop being so defensive and scared of what the rest of the world @MONTH1 think, and let people express themselves however way they @MONTH1 choose. We act on what we feel is right and diplomatic instead of following the vision that was set for our nation through the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2.     When it all comes down to it, we still hold the right of freedom of speech. So if we really look deep into this subject, censorship is violating the right that every @CAPS3 citizen is promised at birth. I say be yourself and create what you want to create without any limitation. We can't allow cencorship stop the process of creativity."	7230	7231
5105	2	"In the world today there is a huge amount of explicit materials in books, movies, songs, video games, etc. But why get rid of them? We have lived with it already for so long. Getting rid of these 'explicit' books would be getting rid of some of the worlds greatest books.     There really is no reason to get rid of explicit materials in libraries. Young adults and adults do not mind the foul language in these books and movies. They make them seem more realistic and up to date and it keeps them focused, if the character in a book or movie uses a curse word then they would know the person in the book or in the movie is being very serious.     Many people love reading books, different varieties too. Such as mystery, suspense, sports and, my favorite, crime investigations. If someone were being chased by a murderer, im sure the author would make it seem realistic and have the character running scared and screaming some curse words to get peoples attention to help them.     If explicit materials are becoming such a problem have the author rate the book, like they do with movies. Make the child or whoever is checking out a book or movie have to have an adult over the age of @NUM1 check out the book for the child. Just like at movie theatres, kids can not get into an @CAPS1 rated movie unless a parent buys the tickets for them to see that movie.     In conclusion, getting rid of these explicit books in libraries would be a waste of time. Most people that go to libraries are young adults and adults that would enjoy a scary scene when the person is shouting explicit words to get peoples attention. the words grab the readers attention and draw them in to keep reading the book and to never want to put it down."	7232	7233
5106	2	"Offensive or @CAPS1?     The library is a place where everyone can get reading materials that they desire. A topic that one person finds offensive @MONTH1 appear interesting to another person. A book that someone finds offensive is that person's @CAPS1. So if they are offended by the book, they can just not read it.     One topic that gets a lot of debate about is violonce, especially in movies. Some people hate violence and think it should not be in movies, and other people love violence. If a person thinks that a violent movie is offensive all they have to is walk away. Another topic that i can easily think of is sex. Parents do not want their children picking up and reading books about sex, but sex was popular in early english literature. People have many opinions and different styles. That is why there is many genres of books, movies, and music. A person should just worry about the genre they enjoy.     What is defined as offensive anyways? There are billions of people in the world and i guarantee all of them get offended in different ways. If we were to take down every single book that was offensive to anyone, we would not have any books in our library. It is a person's responsibillity to be mature enough to be able to read what they want and to leave the things that they don't want to read alone.     Not everyone has the same past. Different people in the world go through different events and different adversities than others. When people usually find something offensive it is because of something that happened to them in the past. A book about someone who committed suicide could be offensive to a person who knew someone who actually committed suicide, but to a person who doesn't know anyone who committed suicide would most likely not be offended by that book.     The library is for everybody. Just because some people are offended by a piece of work, does not mean that other people are not allowed to view it. Censorship is just an @CAPS1 of what people think is offensive or not. If libraries were to censor books and other materials, it would just make more of a controversy."	7234	7235
5107	2	"Censorship In @CAPS1     In @CAPS1 today they are removing offensive materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect. The school's libraries are becoming more censored. In some ways it is a bad thing and in some ways its a good thing.     Censored materials are becoming more come in @CAPS1 arounf the @LOCATION1. They are removing the books that have been seen by millions, so why remove them now? I think that there should only be certain materials that should be censored from school libraries. Books that promote drugs or drinking under age. Also books that promotes sex. Those are the books that should be removed from the school libraries.     If a certain group of people thinks a book is offensive to them and they want it removed I don't think they should do that. It might be offensive to them but the maybe not to another person. They don't make you read the books or watch the movies that are offensive to you. Just stay away from those materials and you won't have to worry about being offended.     If they do decide to remove certain materials from the libraries then they should have to do it in every library because it wouldnt make sence just to do it in one and not the other. I also think that there would have to be abunch of people that would want that certain material censored from the library for it to be removed.     That is what i think about censored material. There are only a few books and other material that i think should be censored from libraries and the rest of it should stay. The kids wont learn if we keep removing the offensive materials from the libraries"	7236	7237
5108	2	"I believe that none of these choices should be taken off the shelfs, because some of the situations in the books and movies could be history, things that help your children out in school and still @MONTH1 have some intrest for you. No telling how long these items have been out and some people want to get rid of them because they aren't happy with what the item says about their nationality or where they are from.     Im sure there is a lot of people out there that are upset with the stuff they see in movies and read in books that are about drugs and dropping out of school, people dont want their kids to grow up and turn out like that so they try to keep them away from that kind of situations. Well its their problem if their kids watch that kind of material.And another reason why people get upset about the movies they see and watch on tv, are because they see movies about slavery like when their family was treated horrible and they dont want that shown all over the world to people. Sometimes in movies it makes some people out to be someone they are not thats one reason i would agree with everyone that wants the movies and books gone. But their is nothing we can do about it. another thing people are upset is about the music their kids listen to like i said earlier if ya dont want your child seeing or listening to that keep them away from that kind of stuff and everything will be fine thats jus my opinon. So im sayin no they shouldnt be taken out of stores because thats the way of making money and im sure if some people had that chance they would do the same thing.      So here is my answer to your question about the situation that is going on with the drama about books, movies, magazines, etc that should be taken off of shelfs. so i say no they shouldnt be taken away."	7238	7239
5109	2	"I do believe that offensive books, movies, music, magazines, ects., should be removed from shelves. I also believe that they should not be removed completley though.     There are people who really enjoy going to the library, weather its just time to relax and have some alone time or to take your children there so they can pick out their favorite books. I think that having improper movies, books, music, magazines and so on should not be aloud to be on the shelves. Not for the fact that they are improper but because of the fact that children who are not of age are seeing and hearing these things when they should not be.     I think, to make it fair, they should have a seperate room for people of a certain age to be able to buy or purchace these items. That way the people are getting what they want and parents are not complaining about these unexceptable things for there children to see being on the shelves. Not only that but kids or teenager that might want to buy something out of this room and are not of age must be accomodated buy a parent or guardian.      If libraries decide to do this then i believe that people will be more happy and feel good about bringing there children to the library and not having to worry about what they @MONTH1 see or hear. And people who are buying these things wont have to worry about taking them off of the shelves because they are not suitable for younger or unexperienced children"	7240	7241
5110	2	"No, i do not think they should be removed from the selves because if thats the kind of things we like then yes we should have a right to it. Should they be removed from the library and if they were you would have nothing left to read or to look at and to listen to. We all have our own opinion to things and some of us do like those things.      When we have nothing to do and we are in the library we mys well listen to music or be on cell phones or even read a newspaper or magaiznes. We like to do those things because it keeps us updated on the news and things. My suggestion is that we keep them in there unless they are really bad and and then you can take them away. But you dont have to get arid of all of them.      My expirence from this is if you dont like it dont have it in there but we will have nothing to do then"	7242	7243
5111	2	"Have you ever stopped and noticed the censorship in libraries and stores lately? Usually, you will find sections that ban young children from entering due to extreme content. In libraries, I believe that not everything should be kept from children and censored. I believe this because nowadays, everyone has their own opinion of how offensive something is, and just because a few people get offended, not everyone should be banned from viewing it.      One major reason that people think that certain content should be banned from libraries is because they are afraid that children will view or read it. Nowadays, children are much more mature, and can actually handle seeing extreme content. More and more children every day play violent video games and can function normally in society, so reading a graphic book, watching a graphic movie, or even listening to music should not effect them. Another reason that children can handle extreme content is that children are getting smarter, and they know that what is in a book, or a movie, is not reality. With this knowledge, they can easily handle these things and not be negatively affected by them.      Like I mentioned previously, everyone has their own opinion on how offensive something is. Some people get offended by how graphic a book or a movie is, while others might find that it is not inappropriate. Certain things in libraries should have an age restriction, because it is inappropriate, but it also should be up to the parent and the child if they are mature enough to view this content.      Parents should not try to block their children from viewing every thing. Just because a parent thinks something is too inappropriate for their child, does not mean it is. Parents should actually sit down with their children and talk about what they think is inappropriate and what is not. More then often, you will find that parents let their children play extremely violent video games, but will not let their child watch graphic movies.      Overall, I believe that not every thing should be censored away in libraries, and that it should be the parents, as well as the childs, decision if they are mature enough to view or read certain materials. Some people @MONTH1 get offended by the material, but it does not negatively effect everyone, therefor it should not be banned from everyone"	7244	7245
5112	2	"I can think of a few books that are on some of the shelves in libraries that I wouldn't want my child or someone elses child to take off the shelf. I do beleive that certain books, materials, magazines, movies, and more should be removed from shelves in libraries.      One reason certain books, and magazines, and other materials shouldn't be on library shelves is because they are inappropriate for children. Some adult books can easily be misplaced in the kids section. Children also go to the library and most kids want to stay with there parents. If the parents want to go look in the adult section there kids will want to go with them. They will see some of the inapropriate materials lying on the shelves. I am not saying get rid of all books just the inapropriate ones that shouldn't be revealed to childrens eyes as they walk with there mommy or daddy.     A way parents could prevent this is they could go with there child to the kids section and help them pick out a book to read and stay with them you could go another time maybe when you return your childs book to the library if they don't want to leave your side. A way libraries could change this issue is they could move all the inapropriate materials into another room or get rid of them all together those materials should't be in a library anyway.     I beleive that certain materials shouldn't be on shelves in a library because there are little eyes and little ears around that want to learn as well as others. Those inapropriate materials are not what I want my children or someone elses children to look at when they want to help mommy or daddy look for a book"	7246	7247
5113	2	"I think that censorship isant a bad idea to an extent. What im trying to say is yeah there should be somethings kept from little kids eyes till there older but you shouldnt completely band the adult materials from libraries,music,movies,magazines,etc.      The officals in charge of looking over the libraby and planning how it is set up should just make a section for that type of material to be placed and they should put an age limit on the area so that no one under such and such age can go in there. Yeah i can see why most parents would want to all around aliminate that certain material but then if you do you just mite end up having pattitions and everything else for one little thing your taking away from the public who has the right to see it.            The adult material in movies and music is again something the parents of the child has to watch and raise there child not to listen to. Those areas of censorship arnt so easy to take away because the producers and song writers will most likely fight you for trying to change there script and or lyrics. Along with the script writer and lyic writer you @MONTH1 just have to deal with the fans of whatever it is your trying to censorship. Which could cause alot of conflict for you and your company or buisness and im sure thats the last ting you want     Magazines are sometimes hard to censor to because alot of the advertizments in magazines are alcohal,ciggeretts,and clothings linews that @MONTH1 not be appealing to some parents that let ther child look at this material. But also you @MONTH1 have to think about the models in these magazines there just trying to make money like the rest of us there not forcing the children of today to look at there half naked bodys and or such material in the pictures in certain magazines      So all im saying is yeah in some was censorship can be placed on things but dont take the adult images away cause when todays youth gets older there going to be looking and seeing all these things you parents didnt let then see when they were little and there can be alot of problems with people censoring everythin"	7248	7249
5114	2	"If we remove these items from are shelves what would we learn from this, that maybe there are some material suited for adults only.Then your taking alot of books off the shelves just because they have bad or affensive language in them. They just shouldnt throw out all the 'bad books', they should just cheak them out to only the mature readers insted of children.     When I was a boy going to the public library was a daily thing, we would get books,magaizines,and even book tapes. On one of our daily trips to the library I come arcoss this book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 two and it was a at a good price I might add, but when I when to cheak it out the librarian said'@CAPS3 child you are way to young to look at this book , i'll find you something better' then she hands me a copy of @ORGANIZATION1 (which at the times I was long done reading @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1).So @CAPS4 are children suppose to learn about history and important events when the libraries are taking out the most important books of all.     Alot of parents are blameing society for their childrens obessions towards teleivison and video games, but the fact of the matter is that involing your child in reading early will help him succed in the future.Parents, have you ever just thought about turning off the tv or not buying your kids that new video game, but maybe just getting them a new book or board game for the family but if thats the case make it so you know what your child is reading, just be there to help him/her pick out a book. Reading is the first step and never the last.           Some of the books in your local library you make this is garbage but i could also be another persons treasure. Because you @MONTH1 think the book is inapropiate doesnt mean that everyone thinks it is as well. but if you are uncertian about the book then just skim through it before you cheak it out, just know what your taking home. Libraries should keep the books that they have on their shelves where they are, they should just know whose buying them as well as if its reasonable age appriopte. But libraries should maybe do a better job on censoring their magaizines and music and that is mainly directed toward teenagers. So all and all quit sitting at home reading the newspaper and stop by your local library and grab a book, besides you never know what you @MONTH1 find"	7250	7251
5115	2	"When it comes to censorship I believe that there is a fine line between controling and protecting. I also believe that, that fine line changes as we get older. While a parent or adult @MONTH1 @CAPS1 want a child to read about something grotestic or such, an adult @MONTH1 have every right to read what this said child is @CAPS1 allowed to read, but this decision has to be made by the guardian of this child or made by the adult who wishes to read this material. The library should @CAPS1 have the say in what is allowed to be shown to the public and what is offensive. They do @CAPS1 have the right to do so.     I believe that a libray is a source of knowledge for all things thinkable. This knowledge @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be all happy news and good, appropriate information. It never is. But that does @CAPS1 make it right for a library to pull some of the material they own from the shelves and @CAPS1 allow the public to have access to it. They do @CAPS1 posses the right to deteremine what a person can and cannot learn. We all have the right to an educaiton, by what ever means are avialable to us, including a public library. This knowledge could range from pictures or bloody battles or information about a decade where many different drugs were used. But no matter the extremes or innapropriate-ness of the subject, it's the history of our world. We should all have the public access to that.      There is a difference, however, between the access of a minor versus an adult. The adult, over the age of eighteen, is intitled to any access they wish. They control their own life, but a child, or a minor, does @CAPS1 yet have the responisbility to control their own access to whatever they wish. An adult guardian that is raising them has that control, but still @CAPS1 the library. The parent should be the censor for the minor. The parent knows what is good and is @CAPS1 good for their own child. They should be the ones that decide what the child can or cannot look at and learn. If a child picks a book off of the self and starts to read about some bloody, gorey battle and they learn some new cuss words or learn about violence, I automatically think, 'where were the parents while this was happening?' @CAPS1, 'how could the library have such innaporpriate information for anyone and everyone to read?' I do, however, understand the censorship of a child's reading section. I understand the want to remove innaporpriate reading material from a section where there are meant to be children's books. But again there is a presense of a fine line between over censorship and protection.      I believe that libraries should @CAPS1 have the power to take information off of the shelves. There should be an individual decision of whether or @CAPS1 some one is allowed to read or see something. the libraries should just put all the information out there for us to learn and allow the adults to make the decision of what the minors are or are @CAPS1 allowed to read or see"	7252	7253

These articles can be very upsetting, but the more you let it get to you the more the author is happy. A main reason authors' write controversial articles is because it gives them publicity. People often over react to articles written from a very liberal or conservative point of view. These articles are meant to, the authors purpose was to gain notoriety from it.     These books however shouldn't be removed from shelves. If these books get removed how many and what types of books would be left. You might end up with libraries full of @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 novels. Libraries are meant for a community to go there and get books and newspapers that they haven't read yet. As soon as people start taking books out of libraries because of their content, that's the day when people no longer use libraries.      Now a days libraries are becoming obsolete to e-books and the kindle. So this means the people that get offended from noticing something on the cover of a book should for the most part end.       If the libraries decide to change their policy and start taking books off the shelf, then there needs to be some kind of list made to follow. The towns people of the town should figure this one out and maybe vote on it. It is their library and they are the ones reading the books.      If you ever find yourself looking in your library for a book of interest and see something offensive. Just skip over it and don't think anything of it"	7254	7255

I know I would and thats why I believe that censorship in public libraries is not right. The libraries are there for people to read and learn, and everyone is different and like and dislike different things. I do agree that some things in libraries are very inappropriate but that's why there are different rooms for adults, teens, and children.     I think that censorship in public libraries is wrong. People go to libraries to get information about something and if they go there and can not find something on their topic, they will probably be upset. I find that I can trust what a book says more then I can trust what the internet says because people can go and change what the websites say but people can't go through and change what a book says unless they retype it.     Katherine Paterson said 'If we all had the right of censorship then there would be no books left on the shelf for any of us', she was very right when she said that. I don't think that censorship would work out to well because people aren't always about doing the right thing. Someone could find an inappropriate book and take it off the shelf trying to be fair, but then there are other people who would take a book off the shelf just because they don't like it, and that's when it's wrong.     There is a lot of inappropriate material out there that should only be viewed be adults. If someone was to find an adult book in the children's section then yes that would be inappropriate but there are other ways to keep your child from seeing those things then just by taking that book off the shelf. That's why, in most libraries there are different rooms, of books, movies, ect., for different age groups. I think that having the different rooms doesn't just help with seperating the different age groups but it also helps you find what you're looking for faster.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong because a library is a place to come and learn, everyone likes and dislikes different things, and there are different ways of keeping inappropriate books out of younger people's hands. Now that you have read @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I will ask you, what do you believe?"	7256	7257
5118	2	"Offensive acts and language in books, newspaper, and magazines is a big problem face our community today. So many different races are joining each other and some people dont think before they act and that can be very offensive to some people. Reading newspapers, books, and magazines have became a daily activity for most city walkers. They are constantly reading the newspaper on there way to work. Some sit in the park and read magazines for hours. Offensive material needs to be taken seriously.     Music today has become more revolutionized in a way that all people sing about is vulger lyrics and inapropriate language. For example; rap artist, all they talk about now is having sex, taking drugs and getting money. Is that something you want your children to be listening to when they grow up? Parents need to make the right choice and keep control of what your children do. So many people are doing drugs and having sex because of the music they listen to. Vulger and disrespectful language needs to be taken seriously for your childrens health and safty.     People have been watching @CAPS1 sincer the first television was ever made. Color television was a very big improvement. But what are they doing about movies with '@CAPS2' rated material? In most movie theatres', they have a law that you must be seventeen years old to buy a ticket for '@CAPS2' rated movies. The only bad thing about that is, the seventeen year old can buy everybody else who is not seventeen, a ticket. Thats considered cheating the system.      People's @CAPS4 is a very popular @CAPS4 that everybody in the world reads. It keeps people up to date with all the celebrities and what they do in the real world instead of in the television. I see little kids all the time looking through those magazines, and some of them don't have the best material for children. They need to have a law that you have to be a specific age to buy some of the different types of magazines.     So in the end, material that is not appropriate for children and young viewers, needs to be taken seriously than it is today. Kids would not be doing some of the stuff they are doing today if there was some rules about listening to music, watching @CAPS1, and reading books and magazines. Take some time to think about some of the things that are out there and make a choice"	7258	7259

5120	2	"Dear Newspaper,     The removal of books, music, movies, or magizines from shelves is unacceptable. It is a problem occuring across the country. Our nation was founded on the principles of freedom of speech and press.  No one should be allowed to take away a book from someone just because they think it is offensive. It is unfair to the people that wrote them and to the people that have not expierenced them.     In my expierence I have only come across a few books that have been offensive to me, but have I asked the libary or bookstore to take them off their selves? Absolutly not! It is unacceptable that one person can just take down a book the only person that should prevent you from reading a book, watching amovie, listen to music, or read a magazine are your parents. Sometimes even your parents should not be allowed to take away that expierence from you. Things should not be hidden from people because they will be found and when they are they will be even more offensive because the people have not expierenced it before.     Almost any book, song, magazine, or movie can come across as offensive to someone and if every person decided to take that book down from the shelf 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (@PERSON1). It is unfair to the people who have not read or expierenced that book, movie, or song etc. for some one to pull it off the shelf because someone that hasn't read that book could love it. It is also unfair to the author, director, or conductor who created the book etc. for it to be pulled off the shelves. Although some books are meant to be offensive, most are not and just because one person or a group of people think that it is offensive doesn't meen it actually is.      There should be no cenorship concerning what goes on the shelves in our public libraries. It is unfair to the people that wrote them and the people that have not expierenced them. It is a stupid thing to have and we should not hide what is wrong with our world becaause then we can never fix it"	7262	7263
5121	2	"Content featured in a library should not be taken lightly because of the words or the message that it presents.  Everything from Books, music, movies, magazines, videogames, art, and others can convey a message when the viewer sees it, wether it be positive or negative.  The creature of said content has that right to make it, and no one should strip him of that right.  however, it seems that libraries across the world are banning that content because they personally find it offensive.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc should not be removed because it goes against the first amendment, it is an insult to the man/woman who created the content, and the fact that the banning or censoring itself is judged on one's opinion with the library itself than rather the general public's opinion.     The first amendment was created as a way to ensure that everyone has that right to have a voice.  Wether it be speech, religion, press, or actions of an individual; no one has the obligation to go against it.  The fact that the libraries can ban or censor the content in their facilities is against the first amendment because they are implying that you have no rights when your content is being viewed in the general public.  This action to neglect the first amendment can lead to other acts such as: protest, book burning, anarchy, etc. is not only an overall visual on how blinded people can be when a topic they do not agree with can affect them, but how they can easily neglect the hard work and thoughts our forefathers put in to make the @CAPS1.  Censorship of lyrics, movies, and magazines are another act against the @CAPS1.  One of the reasons why ratings systems are on these items is to warn the reader, but to also protect the creator's first amendment rights.  The first amendment gives authors and creators more freedom to write their stories uninterrupted with safeguards, and to lock their chances of having their voices heard is, well...an insult.     Take for instance, @CAPS2 @NUM1.  The book's author (who for the sake of this essay shall not be named.) had his material stripped from library shelves and burned to the ground.  He expressed how insulted he was, how badly misinterpereted the book was, and was overalled appaled by their ignorance.  This begins a new reason why books should not be banned or censored from libraries: insulting the author.  Multiple books such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 code, even religious texts such as the bible and the korran are banned from libraries because of their accused 'offensive' nature the books poseess.  The authors are insulted and hurt that they put a lot of effort into creating an engrossing and open minded world for the reader, only to be shot down by the libraries dictatory ruling on their content.  It can also lead to the libraries sense of poor morals being contradictory to the content they have not decided to ban.  Which leads to this: why is the libraries' opinion more powerful?     Now before the next reason is discussed, it is acknwoledged that the Libraries have that right to ban materials because it is their facility that they pay for; but the process that they undergo to confirm a banned book is rather opinionated within the library itself. Libraries should not ban or censor materials based on their own opinion because it resonates a biased tone that the libraries poesses.  The judgement on a book is settled between that said library and multiple libraries across the district.  Granted, some libraries will agree that it should not be banned or censored, but it will all lead to majority vote.  Instead, that decision should be discussed between schools, communites, councils, etc. so that way a more outspoken voice can support or deny the material.  It doesnt ensure that the book will not be banned, but at least a general voice will be more sufficent than a concealed voice.     Libraries should not have the right to ban or censor materials contained in the libraries because it goes against the first amendment, it is an insult to the author or creator of the material, and the banning or censoring is judged with the libraries opinion than rather the general public's opinion.  This is an ongoing topic that is still being discussed today, and will most likely be ongoing in the future.  This has been written to inform and, hopefully, persuade you that this is a serious matter that should not be taken lightly."	7264	7265
5122	2	"Dear news paper company,     I think that everything should be put on the shelves, but have age restriction if @CAPS3 is that bad. I think that if @CAPS3 is published, @CAPS3 should be aloud or else there would be no reason to have @CAPS3 published.         I can understand where the society would come from by saying that @CAPS3 should'nt be there because of the fact of young children wondering around looking for something. I can understand that there should be things young children should not see.     My answer to solve this problem is, either make a separate room that only a certain age can go in or, just have a restricted section in the same room that kids cant see.         Now, the only thing about having @CAPS3 visible where kids could see is if some places had porn as an option to choose from, then that would defiantly need an age restriction and a separate room.    For instance, my local movie rental store, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, has a separate room that has an age retriction on @CAPS3 because that is where they keep the porn. You have to be @NUM1 and older to enter.     Another experience I have witnessed in the past was my middle school, @ORGANIZATION1, in their library they had a restriction section that we could not go in for books. The only people who could look at those was eighth graders. They had options like @PERSON1, @CAPS3.     The reason this book was in the restricted section, like the rest of the books, @CAPS3 was meant to be a scary book. @CAPS3 was the book that every eighth grader wanted to read. Every sixth and seventh grader was anxious, whether @CAPS3 be the reason of being aloud to be there or just wanting to read the book, they were anxious.     Thank you for reading my letter and my opinion on letting anything be on the shelves. I hope you take into suggestion that you post this so that local libraries, movie rental areas, and stores can see that @CAPS3 is ok to put things up as long as some things have age restrictions. Once more thank you for taking time out of your day and reading my letter of concern.                                       Sincerely,                                     @LOCATION1"	7266	7267
5123	2	"Censorship is a good thing in many ways, but it does have it's flaws. In libraries the books are usually sorted by the type of genre they fall into. For this I am not so sure that censoring a libraries' books' will really accomplish anything other than wipe out a whole shelve. The idea of censorship is meant to keep kids under a certain age from seeing many things that even adults today don't like to see.      We should not waste the time or man-power that is required to make a library censored, because if a kid wants a book that is no longer available at the library they can always find it to read free on the internet. All that censoring a library would do is make it a little harder to find a certain book. Also, the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, gives us the power of free @CAPS3, isn't the whole censorship idea covering that up to us?     A better way to censor the library would be to but all of the books that are questionable into a section that means an adult has to be with kids to check them out. This way you are not interfering with the free @CAPS3, and you can censor what is being read by children.     I beleive that libraries' should not be censored. It is to hard to keep kids from finding those things anyway. It would be a waste of money and man power to go through each and every book making sure nothing that is inappropriate is in them, especially if the kids can still find the whole book on the internet. Also, I feel that censorship is blocking one of the ideas that created our nation, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 of the @CAPS5."	7268	7269
5124	2	"Books shoudn't be removed because they are too offensive to someone. Books should just be marked or rated. More mature books should be rated or marked different then other books that are not as bad. An author shouldn't have his/her book taken off the shelf just because a reader found it to be too much for them.           Movies have a rating and only certain age groups are allowed to see certain movies. It works well and i personally believe that it should be like this for book, magazines, and other materials. If books and magazines were marked and only certain age groups were allowed to read them i think it would work well. Before getting a book the reader should check into it to find out what they will be reading about. If they think that the book or magazine will be offensive they shouldn't get that book or magazine.      I believe that censorship is a problem in libraries and that rating or marking a book by its contents will be a great way to solve the problem. Older and more mature people should get to read the books that are more violent, sexual, and intense books. Younger kids should get the books that are for their level of reading.      Books, magazines, movies, and other materials should not be removed from shelves because they are found to be too offensive. Books and magazines should be marked or rated so that people will know what kind of book they are getting. Older more mature adults and teenagers should be aloud to read the more offensive, violent, sexual, and intense books. Younger kids should get the books that are set for their age. I believe that making a rating or marking system would help solve the problem of censorship."	7270	7271
5125	2	"Libraries and censorship? My opinion on this matter, is that libraries should not use cesorship. Everyone gets offended by something different. I don't see why someone would come up with the idea to censor libraries. Most libraries in @LOCATION1 don't have harmful or offensive books, magazines, movies, music, etc.     If you want to read a book that is offensive, then make the choice to read it. Make your own choice, don't let others choose for you. If your under eight-teen then clearly you can't check out and adult book. If you can't make your own decisions, then talk with a parent or gaurdian about it. If libraries used censorship, there would be no books, magazines, movies, etc. for us to enjoy. What's the point of having a library if it has no books? I'll answer that for you. There is no point!      Libraries carry a variety of books, magazines, movies, and music for a reason. That reason is business. Most libraries carry popular books, magazines, movies, etc., that someone could think is offensive. Thats why most libraries have thier items in different sections. If your not eight-teen then stay out of the adult section unless you have permission. It's not rocket science! If a bad book ends up in the kid's section, just tell the librarian about it. Let them handle it, it's their job. If the librarian cares for thier business, then hopefully they will move the book to where it's suppost to be. That is how you will prevent these accidents from happening.     Censorship would ruin a place like a library. If everyone got what they wanted, there would be no books, movies, music, magazines, etc. Theres some things in life you just got to let go. Censorship in libraries is one of those things. We are talking about a library here people. Let people express their self by letting them read what they want to read! If you want a library that has no offensive or harmful items, then go build it your self. Thats my opinion on censorship in libraries."	7272	7273
5126	2	"In the united states there are alot of book stores, librarys and other stores with most of the same things kept inside them. There are alot of things in our library that are offensive, nudity, laungauge, and all sorts of different types of things. But I do not think any books or any other material should be taken off the shelves if there offensive.  Just because there is somthing that somone doesn't like doesn't mean that they should get rid of it because other people might want it.  If there is somthing offensive in a library or wherever it might be then those people should just look at somthing in a different section and not worry about it.  If it really starts to bother them then they need to go to a different library.  Although i do think some book stores should have a private room or atleast sighns telling that there is material in a certain isle that you need to be a certain age to see or that it is rated @CAPS1.  But i think all books, movies, mags, and media need to stay on the shelves some @MONTH1 be very educational, even though it @MONTH1 be very innapropriat at the same time."	7274	7275

Wheather it be about a sports team or something personal. I also think children should have a limit on what they can and can't check out of the @CAPS4.     First I think that books and magazines should really be looked over and see whats appropriate for kids, espically magazines. I'm not a big reader and don't go into libraries alot but I have seen some pretty graphic magazines that little kids look at. If I was a parent I know for a fact I wouldn't want my kids to look at some of the stuff they have in them. I think the books arn't such a big deal as the magazines because not as many kids want to read an adult book they would rather read a kids book.     Next I think that music should also have a limit. I'm a country music fan but i've heard some of the other stuff and almost all of it has bad language in it. Alot of people like that music but there's alot that find all the language in it to be offensive, like my grandma. I think to, that kids hear it too much and then eventually they start talking like that.     Lastly I think that movies can be the worst of all. Kids I think should definitly have a limit to what they can and can't check out of the @CAPS4. I don't think they should remove everything from the shelves but kids should be limited to what they check out. Many kids get exposed to bad stuff at a very young age through movies.     Alot of people have different views on things but I think all of us have read books or magazines, watched movies, or listend to music that has offened us at some point. I believe that libraries should pay close attention to what there putting on the shelves."	7276	7277
5128	2	"Cencorship in libraries; good or bad? Yes or no? People all over the world have different opinions; so why should we be forced to read the same type of books? Just because someone is offended by something that they came acrossed in a book does not mean that the person next to them will be. The library is open to all ages and a fifteen year old girl is not going to be interested in the same book as a ten year old boy. Don't forget that there are also many choices and a wide variety of books to choose from. Before you make up your mind about cencorship in libraries think about the downfall of it.     Every @DATE1 some people go to church and some stay home, not every person in the world share the same beliefs. It is exactly the same with what type of book you want to read. Teenagers seem to like love stories or books that involve the impossible, while kids love picture books, and adults like stories about crime and mystery. There are books in the library that will satisfy all of our needs we just need to look in the right spot. Cencoring the libraries because one person found a comment in a book that offended them is unnecessary. Just because they believe in that certainly does not mean their neighbor does and that is something you have to take into account.     When you were a kid you read picture books and in the library you went straight back to the kids section. If there was a book your mother did not approve of she would not let you get it, but she wouldn't make them take it out of the library. So why should they start now? If you are not interested in that particular book than put it back and get another one, there is no need to make a bigger deal out of the situation. Remember that the library is used for all ages and we all have different type of books we like to read.     The library is full of books of all kind. Im positive there are books in there just for you. Say you check out a book and it offends you because it goes against everything you believe in, then take the book back and check out another one. Instead of throwing a fit and demanding that the library take the book out just simply return it and go pick out a new one. It's as easy as that and next time just be sure to read a few pages into it to decide whether or not the book is for you.     Cencoring the library is not a need and can be avoided. Teach the kids at a young age how to check out a book and make sure they know they like that book. You can not change your beliefs, but you can choose the things you do around them. Every book has a summary on it, read that first and if the book appeals to you then read the first couple pages. This way there is no need to have cencoring in libraries if you are big enough to go to the library by yourself then you are big enough to know what books are appropriate for you."	7278	7279
5129	2	"No I think that everybody should have the right to @CAPS2 what ever they want. just because some people think its offensive doesn't really mean that @CAPS3 is. I also think that if stuff is graphic you they should have a age limit on @CAPS3, doesn't mean you have to take @CAPS3 all the way off the shelf!     A book is kind of the same as a movie. They have a lot of offensive movies that people shouldn't see, but that doesnt mean they take @CAPS3 off the shelf they just put a age limit on @CAPS3. I think @CAPS3 should be the same way for a book.     Like the artical said if everybody that thought a book was offensive and and took @CAPS3 off the shelf. Then there wouldn't be any books left. Everybody is titled to there own opinion. what they think is offansive might not be offensive to that other person. Thats just what they think.

5130	2	"I beleive that it is up to the parents to make the desicion if it is appropriate for there chilren to view. I think that parents should be viewing what there kinds are viewing and making sure it is appropriate for them to watch. At the same time the kids should be mature enough to decide if the material they are viewing is apporpiate for them.     The library should be setting up a rating scale like what they would have on any video game, television show, or movie. When I was younger there wasnt such a big emphasis on material kids were viewing. but now that times have changed things need to change as well. Since kids should be aware of what there watching, I belive that a rating scale would be a good rule set into place. With a library card they can set up an I.D. system to tell how old the kids are and with that knowledge the librarian can make sure the book the kid is checking out is age appropriate for them.     If the matrial the kids are viewing is too inappproriate the kids are going to be under the impression that it is ok to commit these acts and they @MONTH1 go off and do things such as drwing on the walls, stealing cars, robbing banks, bullying, and overall inappropiate behavior. For example: If little @NUM1 year old @CAPS1 decides to read read a book titled '@CAPS2 of @CAPS3' it @MONTH1 be too mature for him and if it @MONTH1 have material inside the book that will cause him to think that the stuff inside the book is ok in society. and will grow up thinking that that kind of behavior is @CAPS4.K.     Kids should have a say in this since this is about them. They should be mature enough to make the decision if it is @CAPS4.K. for them to view that kind of material. With age come responsibility thats what they should be being told. The parents should be telling there kids that some material is just not age appropriate and they can't view it untill they are older.     This is my say in this debate. Like I said before parents should make sure the material there kids are viewing is appropriate, and the library should be doing something about this issue to. Along with that the kinds should have a say and be mature enough to make the desicion if it is age appropiate for themselves."	7282	7283
5131	2	"Do I think offensive books be removed from the libraries? No, I think not. Books have many different uses. They present history from differnt centuries all around the world. They take people on adventures though imaginary lands. They give the freedom to express themselfs. Books can even be used to change peoples emotions with a single word. If we removed every book that someone had a problem with, their wouldn't be any books left!     Before people wrote anything down, humans where in prehistory. Before history. Because people have taken the time to record their past, we can get an idea of what life was like for them. Someone said that history repeats itself. If there where no books or writings, history could be forgotten and mistakes we forgot about could happen again and again. Since we have books, we can be saved from this deadly ongoing cycle. We need books. They remind us who we are, but books not only do that, but much, much more.     Talented writers can create an entire world in their head, and put it on paper. They can take people though the darkes caves, dive into the deepes part of the ocean, and explore the farthest corners of deeps space. With books you can go where ever you want and the only thing you have to do is turn the page. The freedom books give people, should never be taken away from an individual.      Individualy everyone is different. We all have different apperinces, different interest, dislikes, and different opionions. Books give people the frreedom to express themselfs. Not one person on the face of this @LOCATION1 is exactly the same. Since everyone is unique we all view the would from different perspectives. No one is going to agree with every last thing. Perfect example of this are books. Someone could write a book and someone else might not like it. If that book was taken off the shelf, then it would be only a matter of time till more books followed.     I understand that not every book can or will be kept on the shelfs, but people can't just go have a book in the trash party! For it to work there has to be balance. I believe it's true what Katherine Paterson has to say, because if book removing gets out of hand their would be no litature left! People need books and other materials to express themselfs, to learn, and to have the freedom to express themselfs. Go read a history book, if you take their freedom away, you know what will happen. History would repeats itself"	7284	7285
5132	2	"I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Student and adults have the right to read whatever they like to without someone else basically telling them they cant. If someone removes a certain book or movie from the library because it @MONTH1 have been found offensive is their issue. It should not be removed if only one person disapproves of it.      Just because one person or a couple people dislike a certain book or movie should not have an effect on someone else who does like them. If one person likes it and another person dislikes it, it should not be a big daeal. Everyone has theit own opinions and should be delt with accordingly. If one person dislikes a certain book or movie, it is their issue, not someone elses.      Removing books and movies from the library, whether its the school library or a public library, is wrong and should not be occuring. If someone does not like it then they dont have to look at it or rent it. If someone does like it, it would be rude to remove the item because of a complaint from a person who dilikes it. Everyone dislikes a certain book or movie so if everyone removed a certain item that they disapproved of, there would be no more books or movies left on the shelves for people to use."	7286	7287
5133	2	"Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 are millions and millions of movies, books, magazines, and songs out in the world today. Everyone being different in the world, will have different opinions on what they think should be appropriate to view and what should not be. Everyone has different taste and they way that they view certain things.          I think movies have done a good job on classing the movies for certain age groups to see and what not to see. Magazines and books are not grouped as well as movies are these days. They are not too far behind tho. @CAPS1 is magazines out today called @CAPS2 @NUM1, telling the audience that the reader of this magazine should be in the area of age @NUM1. But, not like movies if someone under the age wanted to buy this, they would not be stopped.           I do not think you should be able to remove a certain source of information based on because, you do not like it. I think if @CAPS1 is a certain book, movie, magazine out that creates a group of people upset than they should be able to get that source of information looked over buy a higher source. In most cases if the source of information is inappropriate than they will mark it as an adult audience only. In my opinion that is a really good way to handle the conflict because, in stores they have a certain section where only adults can enter.            I also think if an author or director comes out with a really bad book, movie, or bad magazine than @CAPS1 should be a group that could have the capability of removing that book, movie or magazine. Once again, it could not be one or a couple of people upset with the source of info. It would have to be a rather large group of people. The reason it having to be a rather large group so, that it would prove that maybe this book, movie, or magazine does have a wrong image on the people out @CAPS1. A little group of people not liking the source of information would not prove much other than that certain group does believe or see the way alot of others do.           In certain cases I do believe that a book, movie, or magazine could be removed from shelves but, in most cases I do not. @CAPS1 will be books, movies, or magazines out @CAPS1 that will sometimes need to be removed but, I do not think this will happen very much. It would not be fair to the author or director to @CAPS2 remove that certain source of entertainment or information based on a couple opinoins"	7288	7289
5134	2	"I don't think we should get ride of the books, music, movies, and magazines at the libraries there's no piont of do that beacuse there is an easier way to deal with this problem without removing things. Like keep thnig out of the reach of kids.     Some of the reasons why is beacuse libraries are for both kids, teens, and adults. It wouldn't be fair to the to the adualts and teens if they couldn't read or listen to music and other things that are there for every one. I think there is a simple way to deal with it. One of the ways I would deal with this is by taking all the things that are not for children and put it high so the kids wouldn't be able to reach. Like the way partens do at home with their own kids when they don't what the kids to get or touch something. Another reason is because there already is a kids area. Also moving things around in the libaray isn't that big of a deal it might be a lot of work, but if you really do want to keep the adulat book at the library I think it would be worth it.      Libraries are ment not just for kids or adults but every one and if I just heird that they are going to remove things just so the kids can't get to them. I would be a little upset since there are other  ways to deal with it."	7290	7291
5135	2	"Fahrenheit @NUM1 is a novel that is considered by many people to be a great classic. As a freshman at my high school I was required to read it. This book is about the 'future' and what it @MONTH1 hold for us. The author of this book predicted a future where people have lost touch with the real value of life and each other. This mainly comes from people being too absorbed in the newest tech devices to the point where a husband barely knows his own wife. Also in this novel, it is a crime to read or have any works of literature. Any books found are burned. When questioning whether to ban certain books or not, it is important to keep in mind this story, where things were taken too far.      There is a certain value to be had in the stories and novels that we read, a value that can't be replaced by anything else. There is much information to be found in books and much that can be learned. I don't believe our society will get to the point where it is a crime to read or where books are burned but, at the same time, there are certain offensive matterials that shouldn't be available to the public.     In our history books have already been banned. For example, @CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3, a book about the truth of slavery, was outlawed in @LOCATION1. The reason it was banned was mainly because people who supported slavery didn't want a story about the ugly truth of it to get out. What if this were to happen today? What if there was a book that told a certain truth about our country that most people were oblivious to and it was banned? It isn't the material like this that should be banned, in fact, these are the types of books society needs to read.      In the @LOCATION2, we are blessed to be able to have almost any book we want to read at our easy access. Libraries our helpful in many ways for both research information or a book for enjoyment; however, there are books, magazines, music, and movies that really shouldn't be at our disposal. For example, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is an inappropriate magazine that shouldn't be available in a library where young kids can see it. Similarily, there are music and movies that are inappropriate as well. There is a saying 'garbage in, garbage out' meaning even the smallest intake of any of these can cause a person to turn it right back around and start spreading it. Is this really what we want in our society?     At the same that we are @LOCATION2 citizens with the right to read, see, listen to, or say whatever we please, there is also a point where we should control what we do make available in our country. A parent shouldn't have to worry about bringing their kid to the library and worrying about what he or she might come across. If for whatever reason a person really needs this offensive material then they could find it else where, not at a public place like the library. The hard part is, who gets to decide what is or isn't offensive"	7292	7293
5136	2	"Our libraries should not have censorship on books that are offensive. For one, why would he or she choose the book if he or she has a problem with it. Just cause somebody does not like the book or has a problem with it does not mean it should be removed. I myself would if a book I find interesting gets censored just cause someone thought is was offensive, @CAPS1 I think it is wrong considering the fact that they do not or have not even read the particular book.     I can get the idea that people want to censor or even get rid of the books cause it is offensive to them. Why should hundreds even thousands of kids get thier desires thrown away over a kids problem? Why should kids be restricted from learning something that they have never heard of before? Why should that particular person get thier way over everyone else? This is nt fair for others to be cut off from learning just cause something was offensive. Example being; I want to learn about the @CAPS2 and the book I have been wanting to read gets removed just cause somebody saw the book and they did not like it. If that event would happen to me I would become enraged, so then possibly I might want to do the same thing that happened to me back to that person.     Dislikes of books can lead to a serious problem especially if others were to repeat the process to others just cause someone had done it to them. Coming from the event of people causing books to be censored and removed could cause there to actually be no books in libraries anymore. The problem with there being no books is that it would be harder to learn without them or even do things like homework or just to read the books out of interest. Why would someone think of this as a benefit? Why would someone think that it is a good idea to stop a book from being read? I just do not understand why someone thinks that they are so special over everyone else they can get their way.     First thing I got to say is who in the world would come up with this idea that can cause others not being able to learn. I would like say say how would this make you feel and even famalies feel. What would be thought if parents found out that others are getting their way over their children, they would say what makes them so much more special than my child. Why should many people get punished over someones opinion? There should be no reason that a person should be restricted from learning what they please no matter on someones opinion."	7294	7295
5137	2	"Every person has read a book they wished was more child friendly. It is a fact of life that there will always be inapropriate books in public and @CAPS11 libraries.The thing is, the current generation that is running our socitey belives these inapropriate words and behaviors will impact the next generation in years to come. I bealive the libraries have a right to remove books, movies, magizines, ect., due to the views of censorship to a certain extent. The main reasons why I bealive that censorship should be usefull to an extent is because it takes away from historical novels, the fact of judgeing what is right and wrong, and it also eliminates the maturity leval of the books movies magizines, ect..     '@PERSON1', a great book from early @CAPS1 socitey, is being diminished due to its vulgar language and harsh themes. Some schools have been taking censorship very seriously and they are removing books like '@PERSON1' from the library. They also have made substitue books that are less graphic and use less prophanity. What the schools are really accomplishing is destroying our nations history. Those old books represent the @CAPS1 history, and without them our history will be lost forever. Unfortunatly without reading some inapropriate books, our children will not understand the consequences of acting inapproiate or the usage of vulgar language.     With the confusion of what is morally correct in society, parents are required to guide and remind their child of what is right and wrong. Without a good firm basis, children scream and eventually become disobidient. If children learn from their mistakes, they will be able to judge what societey views as right and wrong. Having this ability to judge weither an action is wrong or right, is a sign of maturity in that particular person. Once that maturity leval as reached its potential, the view or right and wrong in novels will come much easier.     Movies, music, and magizines now all have age limits. Movies tend to have a @CAPS3, @NUM1, or a rated @CAPS4 rating. The same goes with all sorts of media and literature. Videogames had @CAPS5 @CAPS9 for @NUM2+. Music has an explict label and a @CAPS6 @CAPS7 sticker. What this all means is the age in which the law thinks a persons maturity leval should be at, in order to handle this sort of media and, or literature. If censorship was taken into affect, the media would all be the same, and boring.Censorship can be a good thing if what has been censored is completly inapropriate.     The act of censorhsip should be used in some ways. For example, little children should not be reading 'The @CAPS8 @CAPS9' series, due to its inapropriate themes. The maturity leval of those children has not yet met the recomended standard in order for them to fully understand, and make correct judgments on the characters actions. In conclusion I do bealive censorship should be used in underaged learning, but not in the @CAPS10 @CAPS11, or the public library setting.Once again censorship, takes away from our historical novels, it does not allow the reader to make descions of what is right or wrong, and it eliminates the maturity leval or the book, movie, magizines, ect.."	7296	7297
5138	2	"The question is do you believe that certain materials such as books, mucis, movies, magazines ect should be moved off the shelves if they are found offensive? Why would i find that offensive?     I would have to say yes because if i was a mothaer i would not want my young one reading about bad things( such as inter-course bad words ect). Now a days many movies, books, magazines and music are becoming more explicit. Plus kids now days do anything that they see (monkey see monkey do). Kids are so intellegent we can no longer under estimate them.     Im pretty sure no mother/father wants his or her child seeing these things and i know this because i dont want mine to see these things. If so in a librarie they should seperate the adults things from the childrens. They can also have a area were all the things can go like a private room(must be eightteen or older and must show I.D).      Inconclusion i would have to say things that are explicit us or people find it offensive for our young ones should be removeed from the shelf."	7298	7299
5139	2	I think that pornographic movies should be seperated from kids and teens so they can't get introuble with their familys and have the movie stores gets suid by there parents. But just pornographic should be in a different room where only adults can be allowed to go in and i believe they should have restricted areas.     If the movie stores get suid from teens and kids parents for letting their kids get a pornographic movies. So the movie stores would have to not let kids and teens get there hands on pornographic movies by makeing the law change the age to @NUM1 and older can get the movies. So now that teens are getting smarter by getting other adults to buy the pornographic movies for them so they dont get introuble and get better hidding spots so their parents cant find the movies.      But why do teens take pornographic movies from their parents and pay other adults to buy the movies for them is it to make them look cool in front of there friends. Teens could get introuble and parents should not be putting pornographic movies in a place were teens can find it.     So the one point is that kids should not be seeing pornographic movie by there parents letting them watch it because as a kid is little the kids brain is still developing. So that means by a kid watching porno that kid will get really sexually active as he gets older.       If the movie stores get restricted areas then kids and teens would not be able to get throw the doors of the restricted area. So they wont see it and wont be able to get pass it. The movie store won't get suid and won't have to worrie about it and can go on and not worrie about getting introuble. So adults can get pass it and get the video but teens and kids cant anymore.      So now that movie stores esticited area and now that u have to be @NUM1 or older u dont have to sue the movie stores and u dont have to worrie about ur teens and kids getting them	7300	7301
5140	2	"Clean the Shelves          Do people find it offensive when they find something in a magazine or a book with an inapropriate gesture? Should these books be aloud or should they be removed from the shelves? I do think we should get rid of these books, movies, music, and magazines. If people see these inapropriate comments in a book they might get mad.     When books are found to be offensive, the library should be responsible and get rid of them. You don't want random people getting upset over an offensive comment in a book, movie, and or music. Music and movies are a big problem too. Sure movies have ratings, but music doesn't. Any little kid can go in a store and by any music they want. Most music that they are buying have a lot of offensive language and shouldn't be heard by young ears. People should take action and start rating these books, magizines, and music so little kids can't just go and get them.     In my own experinces with reading, watching a movie, and listening to music, is that it is a lot more violent. It seems that with a movie thats rated @NUM1 it should of been rated @CAPS1. This also happens in magazines. All though most of them don't have ratings, they are still offensive. In the back of the magazine they have ads. It seems like they can put what ever kind of ad in any magazine and be fine with it. But most of these ads are very inapropriate and shouldn't be aloud. The librarians need to do something. They need to make a rating system based on age. So that when people see these offensive material there maturity level is equivelent to the book, magazine, movie, and or music they are watching, reading or listening to.     The offensive books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves or have a rating system. It is for the better if the librarians take action and do this. Plus it's appceting when people see these offensive comments in a book, magazine, movie, and or music at there local library."	7302	7303
5141	2	"Taking away any history is the libraries is ridiculous! We would not be able to learn a lot of things. There would be no past for our kids to learn and live on. Also if you look at it all in a big picture we would be destroying the human race as we know it. There is no positive effect on taken things from a library.     If a book for instance for offensive to one person and that was enough to take it down then we would have no books. Evenetually everyone would have some problem with every last book and there would be nothing left. Without books we would not be were we are today. We learn about the past and the trial and errors humans have went through in our books. We learn how to live a normal live, by now without books we would be estinct.      Our offspring would be the stupidest people since the caveman age. With everyone taking away the books we would have nothing to teach our children but what we knew. Depending on when the books were taken, the whole world could just barely be getting by. Everyday children learn something from a book that will help them in there life. Wiether they know it or not some event will happen and each and everything you learn will go into it. By the @NUM1 or @NUM2 generation I think we would die off to another species because we would be sinking down to everyone else's level on the earth. Some other race would be able to take us out the more stupid we got.We learn from past people who have lived on this earth before us. Without the one before you, you would have learned nothing. Now think most people are not here from the past when you arive. Now how would they pass on their acknoledgement if there was not any books. They couldn't, eventually babies would be born with stupid parents that could barely feed themselves. The human race as we know it would die off all because we didn't want some kids to be influenced by the past. It is the past and what has happened. Whether you choose to shelter your kids they will find out and depending on how they do it could be bad. So teach them as much truth as you can before corrupt ideas like this get into there head.     This is why I think taking books away from anyone is @CAPS1! we would not learn half the things we know. Our children @MONTH1 never learn anything or live depending on the circumstances. Also by the third or forth generation that lived with no books we would eventually kill off the human race. So never decide to take books away from anyone"	7304	7305

So trying to stop a writer from writering bad things that my be offensive to the reader or who ever else is a silly thing to do.But I think it shouldnt matter cause thoose are the kind of thing people want to read,watch on tv and it makes monye.So why would you try and stop something the world wants.     When people go to the grocrey store and there in line waiting  and they see the magazines with all the bad thing that people are going in the world and all the thing that are happing in the world people take intrest in that.And they pick up thoose things and read them. Like when @PERSON1 was hang his kids out the window and had them coverd up with towels and things people wanted to read about that and find out what was going on.     Or for example when pac-man jones got in to that fight at the club and he was about to get put out of leauge and was about to go to jail.And they had it all over @CAPS1 and all over the news,people want to hear about it to see what had happen that night. And then people were watching the news to see what him trouble were going to be.And to find out what happen that at the party.     finally it makes monye to the pres and who ever else.So why would you want to stop people from making monye and doing their job."	7306	7307
5143	2	"In every person in the world their is something different about them. I know  not everyone is intersted in reading. The ones that like to be athletic dont need to worry if the books that @MONTH1 have a bad jesture on the library get tooken out. The people that love to read are going to be effected. The ones that read @MONTH1 like the books that are exciting and are bad, because of the excitement that it gives to them. The only books that people who dont like to read most of the time are books that @MONTH1 be not so good for them or other little kids, but atleast their reading to make them smarter everytime.     Im not much of a reader, but when i do read i read  these smaller book collection from the library. They are books about kids in bad neighborhoods that do things they will regret for the rest of their lives, from killing someone to doing drugs. They are very exciting books to me, so if they were going to take books like that away from our library i would probrobly not read much anymore. That would go for a lot of other kids as well in our school, because i know a lot of people who also reads these same books.      I believe that different materials that @MONTH1 be a bad influence to kids at the library should not be taken away. If the library has them, then they cant be that bad. I think that the materials like magazines and books give out information not just for our reading ability, but our projects and research papers that we have to do. The more you would have to think about it the more you would also see how much these not so good materials help us everyday.      If you dont want your kid to see the movies that they can get from the library,  then i would agree to maybe having the librayians only let twelve year olds and up get the movies then. Dont take it out on the people who use these for there excitement and homework just because you dont want your kids taking this off the shelf. The only reason why i would think someone would need to take this off the shelf, would have to be something like only for adults stores or talking about how to take drugs and get drunk. That would be understandable to me as a student.      This taking of the shelf thing because of offensive towards their children would effect a lot of people. I would be highly disapointed if this ever happened to our library here in town and at our school as well. It would take a lot of education away from our school and community as well. The people who think this is the wrong thing to be putting this offenisve materials out on the shelf need to relize how much it does for us students and for people who just want to research and find more about maybe why drugs are so addicting and what they can do to you. Someone @MONTH1 be doing a health project and need to use the drug books to finish up their projects. So if someone ever did take the materials off the shelves it would hurt most of us"	7308	7309
5144	2	"The topic of censorship has always been a sensitive issue. Whether or not it should ever be used is an even more controversial debate. Since the dawn of free thought, there have always been those who have wished to control the freedoms and liberties of others. To many, this is how censorship is blatantly perceived; as control. Censorship is not a question of what is appropriate for the greater good of the whole, but rather what someone would lead you to believe is appropriate.      Music, movies, magazines, and novels should not be removed from shelves, for any reason. In truth, there should be limitations as to what is put on dispaly for the public, but this does not mean taking away the material entirely. This solution would simply mean placing more graphic items into a private area where age approved adults or groups could view the products. Not all novels or movies are meant to be seen by young children, just as I am sure that a parent would not want their child to view adult materials. However, this does not imply posing control over all materials that a society or a government feels necessary to deem 'unacceptable' by their standards. What someone does, or does not choose is right for them is their choice solely.      One would see it silly to imagine another person deciding what cereal they eat in the @TIME1, or what specific way they have to drive or walk or talk. To be told every single detail in your daily life, or even remotely so, would seem ludicrous. Why should the things we read, or watch, or listen to, be considered under any different circumstances? As a society, we should not be viewed as children, but as @CAPS1 of responsibility and moral. To censor or control what we wish to do or partake in, would be an injustice and a violation of our constitutional rights.      The beliefs of this country are set upon life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and more importantly equality. Even if a material is found offensive, the decision to take it away from the group of @CAPS1 as a whole does not lie entirely on the shoulders of one man, or one society. This decision would have to be made by the person who would choose to view that material. Each individual has the distinct ability to come to the conclusion if something is appropriate for them or not. No one else should be able to hold such a privelege.     Such as the quote states prior to the question asked for this essay, the truth in the statement is remarkable. If everyone found at least one material they saw unfit to be upon a shelf, and they had the right to take that material away from the whole, there would be nothing left on the shelves but dust. Of course, there will always be things that @CAPS1 find unsuitable or repulsive. This does not mean, however, that they have the right to control others seeing it.      Censorship is not a question of what is appropriate for the greater good of the whole, but rather what someone would lead you to believe is appropriate. Not a doubt crosses my mind when I say that censorship is an injustice. As a democracy we are allowed certain liberties and choices that must be debated upon amongst ourselves. Although what others do with such information or materials is beyond our control, we can still give them the opportunity to experience something great. The outcome @MONTH1 not always be how others expected it would, but the fact that they had the chance to view the material is what truly counts. Freedom is a facile thought, but censorship should never be accepted."	7310	7311
5145	2	I think that they shouldnt be took off the shelf because some of it is part of history. Some of this stuff is realy offensive should be but if its talking about history it should still be there. Some people need to just get over that they are there. Some people take it way  out fo perposion on some stuff.      All the books about @CAPS1 and stuff are offensive to them. All the books about the @CAPS2 are offensive to them but you dont see a bunch of @CAPS2 trying to take them off. Afercans take having a ritit over it. All the books that are offensive are apart of history. Some people just take it way to far. None of the books are ment to be offernsive its just wat happen in time. Some people have different oppentions on different stuff. Some people think that they should be off but i think they should stay on the shelfs. The only thang i dont get is why people get so mad about books like that. I mean its just a book its not like its happen to you in real life. So people get so mad when they see books like that and i just sit there and laugh because i think its funny there getting mad at a book.       I like to read those kindas of books. So i think they should stay on the shelfs. I know there are way more people then me out there that like those kinds of books too. Thats what i think about the offensive books should stay on the shelfs and not taking off at any point in time	7312	7313
5146	2	"Have you ever read a book that offended you in any way? Do you know of some horrible books, music, movies, or magazines that just should not be kept in libraries? Well, there are some materials out there that really offend people. Some books, movies, music, and magazines discriminate against a certain race or ways of life. What about the people that are that race or practice that way of life? They should not have to go to a public place, like a library, and be offended. Offensive materials should be taken off of library shelves because the library is supposed to be a safe place to take children, people who like these books can buy them online, and protesters probably are not good company anyway.      A library is a public place that is supposed to be comfortable for all of the public. Libraries are supposed to be suitable for families and children. In order to be suitable for everyone, there should not be any books, music, movies, or magazines that offend people. No one wants to take their children to the library and see their children find a book that is discriminating against them. No one should have to see materials that are discriminating against them. Therefore, it is the library's duty to make sure no one is offended by books and other materials in their library.      When you think of someone who likes books, movies and other things that offend people and hurt people's feelings, you think of someone that isn't very pleasant. Unpleasant people do not need to be at a library anyway. Protesters, who like to read the offensive books, might have strong feelings against the people the book is offending. There is a good chance they might have to see someone they have strong feelings against at the library. This is not a good idea. Eliminating offensive books, music, movies, and magazines eliminates the offensive people who read them. If the materials are eliminated, the library can remain a safe place with pleasant people.      If the book or other materials cannot be found at the library, there are other options for the person who wanting the materials. They can go to a book store and buy the book or magazine. Just because these materials are not at the library does not mean that they cannot be found anywhere. I myself have had to go online to buy a book before because I could not find it in the library. Going online or buying the book, music, movie, or magazines some other place is an option for people who want to read, watch, or listen to these materials.     I have read books about slavery that discriminated harshly against the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 race. I hope that no @CAPS1 @CAPS2 child ever has to see those books. If the offensive books and other materials that we all know of can be found in libraries, they are likely to be seen by people who atre offended. No one deserves to be offended when they are at the library. In conclusion, all libraries should take full responsibility in removing offensive books, music, movies, magazines and other materials from their shelves in order to try not to offend anyone"	7314	7315

I say no because if someone finds something offensive they could not read those kinds of books or don't go to that library. And im sure that most of the books in a library is offensive in some way. And if you take all those off the shelf you wouldn't have very many books left.      A second reason why libraries should keep offensive things on the shelves is because some people might enjoy reading things that might be offensive to someone. If someone finds a book that they like they come back for a different book so the library will have more customers.      I can also argue my opion because I can see why a library would want to take offensive books, movies, and magazines off the shelf because they do not want to hurt anyones feelings or anything and if someone finds something offfensive they might not come back to the library and they would tell other people about it. If someone would reed something that was offensive to them they would be very hurt on the inside so I could see why a library would take those kinds of things off the shelves.      After all that I still say that books and movies that are offensive should be left on the shelf because even if one person finds it offensive someone else might not and that person might want to reed that book and if the library didn't have that book people would not be able to reed it"	7316	7317
5148	2	"Censorship is a big topic in many countries around the world including our own. Everyday governments burn, blackout, or change documents to better help them in their goal of complete control. It's a governments way of keeping some of its power in a more coniving and deceptive way. Although in the @LOCATION1 it's a @CAPS1 given right. Right?      Personally I believe that anyone should be allowed to write or read anything that they want. Isn't that the @CAPS2 dream? Doing what you want? People should be able to live without having the government censor or dictate every piece of offensive literature thats available to the masses. I think it's a gross misuse of power and a right that sadly most world governments take away every day. In my own life experiences my government is trying to become the most open door government ever, but reporters just found that this administration has censored more documents about what the government does than any other administration before them.     Now certainly there are exceptions to this as most dilemas have. Children is the main audience for this censorship. I understand like most parents that children are sensitive and don't need to see, hear, or read certain things at a ceratin age. I can comprehend that argument however it's the parents choice what they let their child see. That's why they have @CAPS3 and movie ratings, as well as childrens sections for books. In our society we try to ease our kids into the real world. I have no problems with that.      I believe that censorship is wrong and unjust. I believe that as an @CAPS2 you hold a right that very few have. I also believe that children shouldn't be subjected to adult material inadvertainly. As a country we can create a way for our children to live without sex shoved into their faces. In conclusion, censorship is wrong and a @CAPS1 given right that every @CAPS2 owns and should not be taken away from them"	7318	7319
5149	2	"I believe that it all depends on the type of library and the age group of most of the people that go to that library.  If it is in a high school then I think that the books do not need to be censored, but in a public library there should be a certain section with uncensored books and a childrens section with books that are appropriate for children.     Most children under the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 should not be reading books about sex or drugs and alcohol.  The libraries in middle schools and lower should not contain uncensored books.  I believe that after middle school though, most of the kids already know what drugs and alcohol are and how they are harmful to you, and the books don't influence them to do it.  I also think that most kids by that time have also learned about sex and the risks of it, and they have already made up their mind whether or not they are going to do it before marriage or not.  Books that have violence in them should not be in elementary schools, however i think that other library's should have them on their shelves, because they are entertaining and i don't believe that they influence any normal person to do anything violent.     It all comes down to the age group of people that will be using the library.  I think that if all book are censored in elementary school and maybe even middle school libraries then they are fine to have in any other library.  If people really think it is necessary to do so they could put an age restriction on certain books, and if you are not of that age or older then you cannot purchase or check out that book from a store or library"	7320	7321
5150	2	"Do I believe that certain material should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. No, I dont think they should be removed. If the material is rated then then children should not read.      Lots of books, music, movies, and even magazines say the @CAPS1 word and cuse.If your offensive about it then dont read it or watch it. There is alot of offensive thing in the world and I dont think they can just be put away.      Libraries should split up adult book and children book so that children cant learn the bad language in the books. If race is involed then that certain race should not read use any material that offensed them      Certain materials should not be removed from there shelves. They should just split the material by ratings"	7322	7323
5151	2	"Should books, movies, magazines, etc. be banned or censored from library shelfs? In this essay I will voice my opinion on how I feel libraries should censor there books. I will disscus, how libraries are currently censoring there books, how certain books affect people, and how I feel libraries should organize and censore there content.     Libraries everywhere all have a different way of organizing there books. Currently, all the libraries that I know of have no sort of censoring policy within the library itself. Some of them do have certain books and or magazines that they do not allow within the library at all, but the books in the library are not censored. I fell that libraries have a right to decide what sort of books and other items they carry. I have been in many different libraries and every one of them has had a different content of items, but I have yet to go to one that has had a book that has offended me in anyway. I also think that people look to much into what things a library carrys, if a person doesn't want there child to read a specific kind of book then they should be the ones to regulate that rule, not the library. I have many friends of mine who's parents have told them they are not allowed to read a specific kind of book. They all follow this rule and they don't find it offensive that the library still carries these books. I do agree that some books or magazines shouldn't be allowed in a library but I don't think they should start taking books off the shelf because one person finds that specific book offensive.     People have started to become very uptight about how they view different aspects of daily life. One example is in the library. When a person isn't able to check out a book from the library anymore because to many people thought it was offensive, I think those people have become to uptight about that specific thing. I think that everyone has a right to read whatever they want. People need to take this into considerstion and have respect for this. I know of many families that don't allow their kids to read @ORGANIZATION1 because of the content of the book. I respect there decision to do this but I don't think that librarians should start pulling that book off the shelf because certain people don't like it. Different books affect  people in different ways but I don't think that we should start pulling books off shelves because they arn't agreed upon by the whole population.     I feel that the current way libraries are censoring and stocking thier shelves is a very smart, thought through process. I feel that libraries should not be allowed to have any dirty magazines or obseen music, and this concept, I feel, is being carried out very well. Of the libraries I have been to I haven't once found a dirty magazine or obseen music there that was able to be checked out. I think this is a good thing because I do feel that those types of things are not appropreit for a public library. I like the content that the libraries have decided to keep. I am able to walk into a library and find a book on almost any subject. I agree with how they are currently censoring there books and I feel they should be able to continue in this manor.     I have voiced my opinion on the topic of, 'should libraries be allowed to ban or censor their books.' I think that the current system that libraries have for censoring books is a very good one. I understand that all books affect people differently but I think that people need to respect othere peoples feeelings towards books. Meaning the libraries shouldn't have to censor or ban these books but they should keep in mind how different people feel. I like the current library organization system and I feel that the libraries are all doing a fine job of making keeping the peace within the confines of their libraries."	7324	7325
5152	2	"We cannot control everyone and tell them what to read. It is their own choice. It wouldn't be fair to only allow them what certain individuals find approiate. Every human has their own rights. We cannot take that away. Parents can tell their children what they are allowed to listen to, what shows to watch, and what they can read. As for an adult, I don't think it should be up to someone else. It has been your whole life, and by now you should be ready to make mature choices on your own.      On the other hand, now a days there is a lot of violent, and bad behavior that can influence children to behave in a unhealthy mannor. We can't get rid of all of that completly, and we never will. Procautions have been made to help influece what you watch. Such as the movie ratings, and on games it has ages for what group it is sutible for.  At most public libraries you have to be a certain age to be able to rent out movies. That is something you could do. The individual would have to be a particular age to rent that item, if it is considered offensive. You have to be a certain age to get a library caard without parental consent. There is ways for children not to view these items. I don't think it's the libraries reponsibility. Considering the library already bought these items to rent out, I don't see how they can just get rid of them.      Many individuals are mature enough to watch, listen and read more progatory materials then others. It really depends on the person, their age and if they are mature enough to not think that these things are the right way. Others are not and there is no way to take this away from them. There are many other ways to access this information. Without a library.     My mom and I watch a series on television that is  called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. It is a violent show, and shows things that use to never be shown on tv, but now a  lot of shows do. We often wonder if these shows give 'killers' ideas or make them behave worse and show some ways to help them be more sneaky to not get caught. For me, it doesn't influenece me in any way. It is only a show. I know that to others it can be more than that and influence them to do harmful things.      Everything is more open now then it use to be. Even if libraries were to remove certain items, there are others ways for the child to access them. There is on demand televison, internet, etc. The parent can lay down the rules, but I don't think it's the libraries responsibilites to remove these items."	7326	7327
5153	2	"Censorship is an extremely opinionated topic.  Some people believe that children shouldn't be reading, listening, or watching offensive or explicit materials, but why?  Today, offensive materials are all around us.  Offensive materials are on @CAPS1, in music, in magazines, in books, and even reality.  Even if its censored, I feel like people would still see it.  In my opinion, censorship would be too much work and trouble to attain.     At this point, censorship would be extremely difficult to achieve.  People would object to it and even reject the idea of censorship.  Once offensive materials are out and are at every turn and twist, its going to be hard to just take away such freedom.  Everyone has different ideas on what is offensive and what isn't offensive.  Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The result of censorship could lead to losing most materials since everyone has a different perspective on offensive materials.  There are even some materials that you just can't censor, for example, history.  Hitler had some pretty offensive beliefs so if censorship existed, then we wouldn't be reading much about him.      When given so much freedom, it might be hard to swallow the fact that offensive materials could be censored.  Some @CAPS2 @MONTH1 even be outraged by this.  I honestly think that we shouldnt even try to censor offensive materials.  We could be focusing on more important things than just sweating the little stuff.  Censorship would overall just cause fighting and losing all of our materials, offensive or harmful."	7328	7329
5154	2	"I believe that certain movies, books, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves. When doing this, people are being deprived of knowledge, and they are being limited by society as well. Certain topics @MONTH1 strike off as 'Offensive' but people deserve to know the truth. Refusing to put certain books, movies, magizines, ect., on the market because it @MONTH1 be offesive is , in some sense, breaking the law. We deal with this issue alot in our every-day lives.          There are certain books out , in world, that talk about serious issues, such as slavery, racism, and other topics that @MONTH1 offend people. When books with deep topics such as those are tucked away from the public its known as censorship. One book or movie shouldn't be taken away from the general public because one group of people @MONTH1 be offended by it. Censorshhip is just a form of hiding the truth from the peopels eyes.     When our country was being created and formed into the successful country it is today, a document was made and sign called the @ORGANIZATION1. Throughout this document were amendmants which were freedoms that the people of the @LOCATION1 had. One of the most important ones , to me, is the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. This amendmant gives the people a right to speak out on their opinions. Now if a person makes a book about how they feel about a topic the market shouldn't hide the book from the public because it is offensive. Its a right that we , as @CAPS3,  to be able to tell the our people how we feel about something.     I dont think that a book should be shout out from a child because they are young. They should be able to read what they want to read no matter what it is. Once when i was younger i went to the library to get a book. Well i found this nice comic book and when i went to go check it out they told me that i was too young to get the comic book. So i was furious about that but i did what i was told and found something else to read. Another time when i went the library i picked up the movie '@CAPS4' and the librarian told  me i was too young to see that movie but my mother went and got the movie for me to watch because it was apart of my heritage. It doesn't matter the age of a person for them to want to learn.     Books, movies, and other forms of writing should not be hidden from the people. Age makes no difference of a person will to know certain things. People have the right to say what they want to say and say how they want to say. The public should have the availablity to books of any topic"	7330	7331
5155	2	I think that the books that talk about killing people should not be on the shelf. I believe books like that should not be and school or anywhere else because they make it look likes it's ok to kill in it's not. people who had family killed should not have to go to a  librarie and see books about it likes it's ok for people to kill.I believe it's wrong and not right and anyway no one want to see books about killin that's crazy. Books that talk about sex is not right or should be and school.It give kids the rights to think that sex is cool when you have book like that and school or anywhere else. I believe that safe sex is very important and everyway and these books and school do not talk about it. I believe if you going have a book like that and school talk about the important things about it. A lot of people do not like to see books like that. I think books that talk about how sex feels good and things should be removed from the shelf. Some moms and dads do not want there kids to see or read about how good sex feels. I believe if we going have books like these on are shelf first talking about them and see how others feel about it because everyone don't feel the same about books and you should give people there respect.  Books that talk about gay people are just as wrong as anything else. I believe it's very disrespectful and wrong. Thats how i feel about some books.	7332	7333
5156	2	"Libraries should be allowed to put whatever they want on the shelves. There @MONTH1 be some people who @MONTH1 feel offended by some things they find on the shelves, but people have a freedom to write about whatever they want. If you feel offended then just don't read it. Libraries don't put books on shelves that you have to read. The books are there to read as an option.     I have seen many books in libraries that seem offensive. I just don't read them. I read what I want to read and other people should to. This is the same thing with music and movies. Why would you want to buy a movie that doesn't even interest you? It's just that simple.      A book shouldn't be kept off the shelf just because it is offensive to you. Other people might like to read about things that you don't like. One oppinion won't change the mind of the libraries placement of a book. Especially if its a book that people are always checking out.      Just because a title of a book is offensive doesn't mean that the whole book is going to be offensive. You have to remember the saying, 'You can't judge a book by the cover'. You have to read the book before you can complain about it.      Libraries should be able to put whatever they want on the shelves. If a book is offensive then just don't read it. Read something that you would enjoy!"	7334	7335
5157	2	"Most people go into a library and know what their looking for or have an idea of what they want. When you hear about people finding things offensive in a public place I find it a little ridiculous. If they don't want to rent it that's one thing but to make a big deal of something they have no controll over is another. If you have beliefs and things of that sort, that's fine, but not everybody has those same beliefs. All you have to do is simpily not rent the book, movie, magazine, music, etc. That's why I think that these things should not be romoved from the libraries.      Everyone has their own opinons that's just the way it always has been and always will be. But you can't please everybody by pleasing one person, and taking books, movies, music, ,agazines, etc. out of liraries because one person finds them offensive isn't going to please everyone. One thing that you @MONTH1 find offensive someone else @MONTH1 really like and @MONTH1 interest them, not everyone is the same. So, if you go to a public library looking for a certaint thing and you come upon something that you find offensive you can either walk away or rent book and things  another way. Insted of going to the library you can order books on an online bookstore or visit another book store. To rent movies or music you can go to a place like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, where you can also get magazines. You can avoid places that you find offensive you just have to research.      Removing things from the self would only make the certain people happy, and that won't result in a positive outcome. People can can simply visit another store with the same books, movies, magazines, music, etc. just finding something offensive isn't a reason to change things. These are all the reasons why i feel like these things should not be removed from the public libraries"	7336	7337
5158	2	"In my opinion and probably many others is, I don't believe that just because some material is offensive to one person it should be removed from shelfs from libraries or stores. You shouldn't have to remove the material just becuase it offends someone. If you removed everything that someone said offened them there problaly wouldn't be any material for anyone to enjoy.      I believe this because sometimes when the material is offensive to one person it can be a learning material to someone else. Almost everyone is offened by something in the world. Just because a book or a song says that a certain type of person is something doesn't mean its true. People can learn to ignore some of the stupidity out there and learn that just because someone says it doesnt mean its true.       For example one time my school had a guest speaker. The guest was very nice and was telling everyone about his life experiences. Not everything was offensive til he started preaching about god, And in my behave I didn't believe it was right to. As bad as I wanted to get up and walk out i didn't. Me walking out could of offended someone else so i sat there and enjoyed the rest of what he had to say. I just kept thinking just because he said to believe in god doesn't mean i have too. So everyone should do that. Just because a song or a book says something doesn't mean it's true.      I understand that some material @MONTH1 be very offensive to some people but taking it off the shelfs @MONTH1 offend someone else. If someone is offened that bad by something they don't nesscary have to listen to it or read about, theres plenty of other things they can read about. If they avoid whats offensive the best thing to do is ignore it.     In over all i really don't believe just because some material is offensive it should be removed, just because one store takes it off the shelfs doesn't mean the next store you walk into will. Your going to run into something offensive somewhere sometime in your life, best thing to do is learn from it. Remember if this one thing offends you that something you @MONTH1 do or say @MONTH1 offend someone else. The world can be a curel place."	7338	7339
5159	2	"Because we are all different, we all have different opinions. Things that some people find offensive @MONTH1 be no problem to another group of people. There is no definite answer to what is offensive. Libraries should not have the right to tell other people what is okay to read and what is not.      Libraries are public places that are there to help the community receive books and other sources of information. They are not around to tell people what is good and bad. What one person finds offensive, another @MONTH1 find very interesting. Telling someone that the material they enjoy is offensive to other people could be considered offensive as well.     Everyone who enters a library belongs to a certain age group. These various age groups make it impossible to please everyone. For example, elderly people tend to find teenage topics inappropriate; therefore, they would have this material taken off the shelves. Teenagers will only read or listen to what appeals to them. If libraries were to remove the materials that appeal to teens because of what does not appeal to elders, the teenagers would have no reason to return to the library.     Some of the things that happened in history could be considered offensive as well. Just because it is part of our history does not mean that it is okay with all other people. If fictional stories are censored due to their content, nonfictional stories should be also.      No one should be able to tell people what is appropriate for them to read and what is inappropriate. One good thing that most libraries do is separate the material based on content. The judgement of whether or not something is intended for teens, children, etc. is fine. Censorship such as that is better than censorship that completely removes the material.      Libraries should not have the right to tell other people what is okay to read and what is not. If libraries were to try to censor their materials to please the community, not everyone would be happy. It is impossible to please everyone. Therefore, libraries should keep their personal opinions to themselves and let the people make their own decisions"	7340	7341
5160	2	"I would agree that things found offensive in items at libraries shoulb be taken out. Yes that is true that mainly everythibng on the shelves in a library has offensive language and to take it off would make people that arent children mad of the fact that they might like having that type of language in it. I think that there should be an age limit on books, music, movies and magazines so that younger kids dont see the not so good areas of materials so that they dont get ideas that are bad or undermining. I have seen movies and books that have pornography and that had foul and intimate language that i really did not like seeing."	7342	7343
5161	2	"Are Books for Everyone?    I do agree that there are books, movies, magazines, and music that children should not see or hear. However, I think removing them from shelves isn't the best solution. Taking them down could anger other readers. What if someone had to get a book for their parent, friend, or siblings? Would it be right to take that privilage away because of age? Being able to check out things should be a right.     Taking the freedom of being able to read, or check out the materials that you would want to see is not such a good idea in my opinion. There are readers out there that read certain things with valgur language, or inapproperate things. I bet with the books now you could rarely find anything without valgur things in them.     There might be a child or teenager who is asked by a family member, or friend to get a book that they want to read. This person might be busy working, cooking, or cleaning, and just doesn't have the time to run down to their local library to get a book. However, seeing that their child is doing nothing, they might ask if they would get that book, or movie for them. If that person would do the task asked by that certain person, I don't think it would be fair that they couldn't get that book because they aren't quite @NUM1 years of age. That is how most libraries work now.    Those are not just the only two reasons why keeping books where they are is a good thing. Another would be maybe you yourself was looking for a book you really wanted to read. However, you only new this author by one of his other books inteded just for adults. Yes, you think you can just look the book up on a computer, but sometimes that's not always an option.      So what I am saying is that people should watch for things that their children read and watch, but not have those things taken off of shelves. Being able to take whatever book you want should be a privilage that everyone should have. That's why books, movies, magaines, and music should stay where they are in libraries"	7344	7345
5162	2	"Censorship, the idea of removing media from somewhere (in this case, in a library) for being offensive, has created disputes everywhere. A library, a place for unlimited media and discovery, is suddenly limited by censorship. Personal opinions create the different opinions on what is and what is not offensive. Although censorship has caused many disagreements, censorship should not be used in libraries, a place of learning.      A library is seen as a media center full of mostly books. But also taking into account the music, movies and magazines that are available, once can find almost any information on almost any topic. Even walking into a library, no matter how big or small, one can visually see the variety and broadness, a place full of availibility. If censorship is enacted, that place of availability and discovery is limited. Topics suddenly become less broad and do not have as much vigor as they did before. Censorship is seen as a way of protection for some, and it is also seen as limiting for others, a valid point. Protection from offensiveness can be beneficial in some cases, but some are able to learn exactly what 'offensive' means through full confrontation with it. Regarding education and learning, why would anyone want their discoveries to be limited?     Censorship and its purpose have been disagreed on, a disagreement that stems from individual opinions of what is offensive. For example, a book found by one person to be offensive can be found by another to be quite interesting. Most importantly, every person has a right to pick a book off of a library shelf to read. If that person finds the book personally offensive to them, they have the same right to put the book back. Regardless of whether an author realized their work was going to cause disputes, one thing is certain- the author of a certain book wrote the book for a specific reason. Just like a musician composing a piece of music for a specific reason, or a movie director and actor working together to create a movie for a certain reason, each is an artist whos purpose is to make their work of media known. Censorship limits their right to do just that.      An author @MONTH1 write a book, or an musician @MONTH1 compose music, but there is no purpose if their own masterpiece will be banned. Libraries would not be seen in the same light- they would be seen as a dead end, a location where only a few books and topics could be researched upon. Each person has a right to choose a book on any subject, at any point in time. Censorship would be robbing each person of that right. Learning, an essential part of education and life, would be taken away within seconds."	7346	7347
5163	2	"Now in days theres alot of things that can distract a student from taking the wrong path in life. For example theres things like bad associations in school or in the community, but there is always a place you can go to and relax and enjoy your day. The place you can go to or even an option for you is the library. In this place you can find many books in many subject or even sports that you @MONTH1 like to do.     The essay that I have to write about is weather certain books, music, movie, or even magazines should be removed. In my opinion i think that would be a bad idea because diffrent people have diffrent likes and dislikes. Now if you take away those things that are bad then some people might loose interest in goin to the library. Even though they are bad people still enjoy reading or even seeing those kinds of things. I myself have a experiance about this subject.     When I was a young boy i really didn't like to read it was one of things I hated to do. There was one day our class had to go the library and write an essay on any book of our choice. So like I mentioned I hated to read so i tried to get out of doin the assignment but i couldn't. I started to look around the library for a book and surprisengly I found a book that intrest me. It was sourt of a gang sourta book. Now even though i hated reading i read the book and i liked it and was able to do my report.     My experiance clearly explains that even though people don't like to read there will always be somethin someone will like. So if you take out the so called bad things people might loose interest in reading, so yea it would be a bad idea to take the bad thigs."	7348	7349
5164	2	"There is always something that is going to offend someone. Are we going to eliminate that something, everytime someone gets offended? I think that certain things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be removed from the shelves just because someone finds it to be offensive. Many can find that source that is offensive to another, interesting; and can even be life changing.     When slavery was going on back in the days, there were many who wrote the discrimination they faced on a daily base.  They expressed thier feelings on a piece of paper because that gave them hope.  Hope that maybe one day thier work will get into the hands of someone, and their heart be touched. And let me tell you, it worked.  People started seeing that color does not matter, in @CAPS1 eyes we are all equal. This literature probably offended many whites who read it.  They could have thought, 'how can we do such a thing as this?' @CAPS2 @MONTH1 have got angry that many were beginning to take side with the blacks. But did this change how we live today?       Literature is something that is going to be viewed in many different ways.  We don't all have the some opinions and thoughts. But thats okay because we are human and it's normal.  That is why, if you are in a libary and you find something that offeneds you; don't read it and put it back.  If it didn't interest you it @MONTH1 interest another.       I have @MONTH1 friends who listen to music, that I hate to listen to. I actually find it fairly offensive. For example, a really famous known rapper,'@CAPS3 @CAPS4,' so they call him.  I really dislike his music. A lot of people can't belive it when I say it. But the truth is that I think his music is stupid. What's the point of listening to music when every other word is a curse word.  But anyway that's just my opinion; you might think different.     So do I think such things should be removed from shelves? No, I think they should be kept right where they're at.  Unlike you, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 love the book, magazine, or what ever it @MONTH1 be.  Such things, can be inspiring and life changing to some people. So try to look at it more as a tool that someone else @MONTH1 need."	7350	7351

There should be no such things asremoving materials from the shelves at a libray that someone finds offensive. Libraries provides book to others to inform them about certain issues, to provide material for others that can't afford to buy the materials, and they also provide enjoyment to others.      Some people might think that libraries should take off offensive material from their shelves; libraries offer that material to provide information to others. If a person finds something offensive to them, then they shouldn't read that certain book, magazines, or materials. Libraries provide certain information to help others gain knowlege, or to provide them with an enjoyment, not to offend others. Libraries shouldn't have to take off information off their shelves because they are offending somebody, but they are mearly providing information to others that apprishiate the information.     Libraries have spent huundreads of dollars providing material to children, adults, mothers, fathers, and the elderly. There are so many people that can't afford to buy books, music, and movies of their own. Chilren of all ages go to a library to gain information, and check out books that they take an intrest in.      Studies have shown that if children are read to before they attend school, they have a higher potential to pick up information, and grasp information faster then children who do not read. It is so impotaint for kids to read, so don't take away that chance by removing materials from the library shelves.      People go to the library to check out books and other materials to gain information. Libraries were created to help others, not to offend others. Libraries are a great way to help people, provide information, and to provide the enjoyment to others. Libraries provide information to people who can't afford to buy materials of their own. Many people gain the enjoyment from reading, watching a movie, and listening to music, and a great place to find that enjoyment is at a local, or school library."	7352	7353

5167	2	"Dear @CAPS1,          I strongly believe that censorship is not a problem or a defect in a public library. I say this for these reasons.          Books are not put in libraries to discriminate against anyone. In my opinion, if a person feels offended by the content of any resource in a library its their own personal problem. Everyone who visits a library doesn't go searching for the same things, some people are intrigued by resources other are not. I think it would just be wrong to remove contents from libraries due to censorship.        Libraries are here to inform us on things we dont know, rather its good or bad, it's here for our knowledge. If their are things adults dont want their children seeing or doing, I strongly suggest they confront them, not the libraries. These educational structures have been built to help children and provide them with a quiet place to learn, not to dicinegrate their minds. I know for sure there are other ways to prevent kids from discovering censored material.          For example, sections of the library with censored material can be sectioned off with adult supervision. Kids who enter this section must be a certain age to even enter this part of the library. By doing this, I'm pretty sure that alot things can be prevented and it'll save alot of pure young minds. Most of all it'll give their parents peace of mind, atleast as far as libraries go.          In all, No I don't support the idea to remove books from the library. I believe it is very self-centered simply because there are millions of people who tend to and like millions of different things. If libraries section off censored areas, like I said. The children might not be as happy, but the parents would be overly satisfied!"	7356	7357
5168	2	"Finding something new or enjoyable thats in the @CAPS1 to read or listen to can be hard sometimes. Especially if you don't know if you want to read something funny or something sad. Even when you don't know if you want to listen to country music or rap. Nobody ever tries to stop you from checking it out either. I mean, if i disliked a book so much and my friend went to check it out, I'd tell her to rethink her choice. Some books and music selections in the public @CAPS1 aren't really apropriate. I believe some should be taken out, organized seperately, or just put away for a while.     I've never really had to complain about a book that i've read. Usually all of mine are books my friend tells me to read. I enjoy sad books, and not the fun happy ones. Weird, i know. I will tell you a time when i went to get a book and it was so inapropriate that i couldn't read on after the seventeenth page. Books that involve sexual things just arent something i want to read. First of all, i was in the @NUM1 grade. I was getting a book at the @CAPS1. Of course i had already read all the kids books, so i went on to the bigger and better books. Not that they were really orgainzed into age groups or anything,  you just kind of knew what ones to get. I picked up a book that was about murder. Like I said, i was in the @NUM1 grade. As i was reading the book, the details got really grucem and started talking about how a girl got raped. I wasn't enjoying the book at all, but i kept reading because sometimes they get better as they go on. This one never did. It kept repeating the same things over and over again. It was terrible and i couldnt read it. When i went to return it back to the @CAPS1, they started yelling at me about checking it out. No one ever told me I wasn't allowed to check it out. They said you needed to be a little older to read the book and whoever let me check it out should have known. I got in a fight with the librarian. I told her she needed to start organizing the books into age groups. She actually listened to me. That @DATE1 I was in there restocking all the books with her. She knew me so well, she knew that I would never intentionally pick up a book about rape and other things of that sort. Organizing was definitely the best thing for that @CAPS1.     Since the little book switch up incident, and reorganization of the @CAPS1, I've never mistaked another book. Now that i know where all the  books are and the kind I want ot read, im not nervous about getting yelled at anymore. Removing books that we don't like to read shouldn't be an option because other people @MONTH1 want to read that book. Reorganizing was a big difference to the @CAPS1. For sure a good change. Don't throw away books, just clean them up"	7358	7359
5169	2	"Has you mom or dad ever walked in on you while you were listining to you favorit song, or reading your favorit book, and began to tell you how awful that stuff is for you? Now i would never say to not listen to your parents but in this case it dont matter what they say, if we are able to handle the topic mentioned in our music and books then we have the right to listen and learn.     Music has been around just as long as we have been, and to some people it is everything. Like this guy i knew he had come to find himself to be in a rut in his life, got into some pretty bad things. One day I told my friend that if he kept living the life that he was living, he wouldn't have a life to live soon. He took my warning to heart and went home and played his favorit @CAPS1 all night, and just listened to the messages. My friend was healed that night and has stayed clear since then. Now tell me, dose that seem like something that anybody has the right to take from you? I know today parents dont like to hear that 'hip hop stuff' but you need to look behind the star and into the message, everybody has a voice and they were able to get theirs herd. So parents befor you go and tell you kids what they can and cant listen to, try it out for yourself, and if you dont get the message then you are a closed minded person that dose not deserve music in their life.     Like all the artists, and authors, I too have a message. Let your kids like what they want to like, or your going to end up with a mess that you will not be able to clean up. Because kids these days are just so free minded, that if you try to lock us away we will become something much worse, something that parents do not want their kids turning into, a rebel. We will rebel aginst all your rules, school rules, everthing if you try to hold us down. Let us be us, because without us there is no future."	7360	7361
5170	2	"Censorship in libraries is not a good idea. Just because you dont like something does not mean that it should not be up on the shelf. If it is offensive to an ethnicity and or a stereotype it should be removed. If it is just stating facts it should be left alone, but if it is considered to be just a false report it should be removed.     Somethings should be censored if they are put out there to spread lies or rumors about someone or something that is not true. LIbrary shelfs are very popular for people in high school but people in high school all ready know about most things anyways. I dont think it should be right to be able to put censorship in a library. Unless it is a offending someones race."	7362	7363
5171	2	"im am writing a essay on if they should remove offensive movies, books, etc.. and i dont think you should remove them things you will cause all kinds of trouble with alot of people and if you remove that stuff from shelves also if you take them away people will lose money.     Me personally i dont think that they should take any of the materials off of the shelf. Just because it is offensive to one person does not mean it is to anyone else. Also if they think it is offensive then i dont think they should be in that area of the library,movie store etc.. Also some of the movies and books are a part of history.          if i was a parent and i had kids that were reading censorship i would be very upset and i know if i was younger my parents would be very upset too."	7364	7365
5172	2	"I think that there are some books and magazines that should be sold in different stores. I wouldn'@CAPS2 think to go to the extreme of taking it off the shelf but rather constructing a place where they can be sold to people of more maturity without, the worry of minor and otherwise impressionable audiences. Music,movies,and games show consumers of the particular that some cd's dvd's and others have warning labels such as: rated @CAPS1, rated @CAPS2, rated @NUM1 and so on and so forth. I do however believe that books and movies and things of that nature, should be released to the public with a type of precaution for the reason that even though it looks safe it usually is the exact opposite.If we were to pull all the books and streams with bad language, obscene literature and others,we would be eliminating over half of the general reading,streaming populace. Another concern that people have is that of which: 'If this title is offensive why do they openly just give it to anyone who wants it.' That is a very important statementbecause if you don'@CAPS2 want parents to get to a point where they protest against the things that their children read, there should be restrictions on them. So in conclusion I do strongly think that there should be restrictions on the thing that are handed out to young immature people"	7366	7367
5173	2	"Have you ever checked out a book that didn't seem unappropiate at all,  but it ended up to be very disturbing? I personally have not and I don't know many people that have either. The censorship in libraries is not a problem.      First of all, when people go to the library they usually have a purpose. Usually their purpose is to find a good book to read or to get a book that gives them information on a subject they want to know more about. For example,  a teen usually goes to the 'teen' area of the library and looks at the books there. Librarians would not place an uncensored book there, so parents don't have to worry about that problem. If an adult wanted an uncensored book than they should go to the ''adult'' section.     Most libraries that I have been to, have a well organized shelving system. Children's books are usually censored. Authors don't write or draw offensive, disturbing, or uncensored things in children's books. It wouldn't be labled a children's book if it did have any of those things.When a library purchases a book, the librarian usually lables what audience the book is for.     I must admit, there is a problem. The problem is with some 'teen' books. Some of teen books have some sort of sexuality in it. I know parents wouldn't want their teen focusing in those things yet, or probably never, but they will  someday.     In conclusion, people don't need to worry about the censorship in libraries. The library is meant for peacefullness and quite time. When people go to the library its supposed to be calm. People should not be disturbed about a book, if they are the ones who went to the wrong section to look for their books."	7368	7369
5174	2	"In this essay, I am going to write about if I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, etc., should be removed from the library shelves. If they are found offensive I think they should remove it. At the same time I don't want them to remove it.          I think they should remove censorship from the library because sometimes adults even kids see things they shouldn't be seeing. Most of the time young kids be saying that they have to do homework, but they don't instead they see other things they shouldn't be seeing. That is the reason why I think they should remove censorship from the libraries.     I also think they shouldn't remove censorship from the library because if they see things like that they would know what could happen to you and it would be something you would learn from that. It could also help you learn good and bad things from it so you wont do that in your life. That is what I think they shouldn't remove censorship from the librabries.     That is the reason why I think you should remove censorship from libraries and at the same time you shouldn't"	7370	7371

5176	2	"Everyone has their own rights to do the things that interest them, right? The answer to that is yes, of course some people @MONTH1 not agree with what your interested in. For example; picking out a book at the library. So many choices like fiction, nonfiction, action, and many more. Some people enjoy reading about murders others might enjoy hearing about monsters, that's their own choice.          I believe everyone should have their own choice in what they want to read, listen, or watch. So why should libraries take things off the shelves? Something that you @MONTH1 find offensive might not be to someone else.          They shouldn't, just because there are offensive things on the shelves, doesn't mean you have to look at it or read about it. If the libraries were to remove everything that is found to be offensive, where would the people that are interested in those types of things be able to find it? They wouldn't, you'd be taking away the freedom that we have to read about the things we want, or to watch and even listen about the things that we want.     If there are things on the shelves you don't want your families to read about, then let them know where they can and can't check things out from. By keeping these things on the shelves everyone will have a choice in what they want at the library.     After reading why I believe things shouldn't be taken off library shelves, maybe many other people will be able to have a better outlook on the interest of other people"	7374	7375
5177	2	"I think that Katherine Paterson makes a good point when she said,'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor----then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I like that because its true if everyone in the world had the right to remove books from the shelves then we wouldn't have any books for anyone to read. Everyone has a different view on what they flag as approprite or inapproprite for young people or young adults to read. People who are racest would most likely say that books writen by blacks should be removed well there goes a percentage of books, while someone whos against drugs, violence, and anything else would say that those books need to be removed well that half of the books are gone.     Most people dont realize what people use books for some people use books for education, some use books as a get away, and some use books as a way to figure things out. By education I mean as a way to learn about different things like a book about violence or sex abuse/rape could learn ways to avoid those situations. Everyday I hear teens talking about this book they read, talking about how they read about some young girl getting ubducted at her bus stop. They were telling about how that story made them think of ways that they could avoid that type of situation. Honestly I feel like if it wasn't for books kids, teens, and even adults wouldn't know what to do in certin situations they would be stuck. Because everyone knows that when a person is talking to you, you tend to zone out or just ignore everything that is said to you I mean you might catch part of it but we all know you won't remember it all. Thats why books come in handy because while you might not catch all of it, it will still be there for you to look over and figure out what you were missing.     Books are an excellent source of information and removing all books when giving people the option to would just mess the education process up. I mean its not just books you also have movies, magazines, video games, and music if you took all that out of the system we would have nothing we wouldnt know nor would we learn anything on our own. All the stuff we have in the world today all serves its on perpose and we use all of it to our advantage.      Thats why I think that we shouldn't have the right to remove stuff that we want to because people would make stupid decisions and we as the people would lose everything we have. So I say no, to giving people the right to say what goes on the shelf and what comes off of it. But I say yes, to having more materials come out onto the shelf"	7376	7377
5178	2	"Censorship in Libraries               @CAPS1 thoughts on the topic of 'Censorship in libraries' is  that it is not right because people should be able to read , listen , look what ever they want. No one should be able to make the decision to limit how much a person can learn.     If everone took something off the shelfs there would be nothing on them.And thats all just opinion on that thing .just because someone is offened by it dosent mean that everyone is.     If you don't like it you should just not get it or look away because someone worked really hard on it.And someone else @MONTH1 need  read it because it corresponds with whats going on in there life.     I'm a muscian and if they told me that i can't listen to a certain type of music i would be livid!Just because i don't always agree with others taste in music .No should tell me I can't play or sing a certain song because it offeneds someone.     In conclusion I don't agree with censorship.I think its a mediocre attempt to control peoples beliefs."	7378	7379
5179	2	"Whether it was a book you were reading or a song you were listening to, I'm sure you thought 'wow, this is highly innapropriate' at least once before in your life. Although, just becuase you dislike a song or book doesn't mean eveyone else hates it.     Freedom of speech, that's what we are said to have in @LOCATION1. Therefore, music and books shouldn't be banned because some find it offensive. We are legally allowed to say whatever we choose in @LOCATION1, and that's also allowed in all forms of writing. I don't believe removing books due to offensivness is fair.     If someone takes the time to write a book, then they must be attempting to send out a message to the reader. The type of book doesnt matter, it can be information, fiction, non fiction, or just a book of poems, the author still writes it for a meaning. The reader will find at least one way they can connect with the writing. A book @MONTH1 be about how horrible the @CAPS1's were in @CAPS2 in the @DATE1's, some @MONTH1 find that highly informative and a great source of information. On the other hand, a different person @MONTH1 be reading that book and is a @CAPS1 himself, wouldn't that person find that book offensive? Most likely the man would despise that book, but just because one man dislikes it doesn't make it right for it to come off the shelves.     I have had an experience where I have found a book extremely repulsive, To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 was the tittle. This book ambushed on blacks the entire story, and being a black girl reading this, I had a hard time enjoying it. But just becuase I didn't enjoy it, doesn't mean every other one of my peers hated it also. I didn't like the book and I will never like it, but that still doesn't give it the right to be banned from anyone reading it. I did learn things about blacks while reading it. Things that I wasnt educated on before reading that book.     In the end, everyone is entitled to thier own opinion. Some @MONTH1 like a book and some @MONTH1 hate that same book. Books are meant to be read and then reviewed on, they aren't meant to be read, hated, then banned. All books need to stay on the shelf, no matter what the genre, topic, or length of the book."	7380	7381
5180	2	"Books, music, movies, and magazines have been censored in some way throughout history. Books, music, movies, magazines usually inform their reader or listener about a specific topic. Unless they are directly criticizing something such as the books about @CAPS1 during the @CAPS2 then they should not be removed from shelves.     First off, people have a right to choose what type of material they read. Removing books, music, movies, or magazines would take away their right to choose. Also, people are entitled to have an opinion. It should be up to that particular person if they want to read or listen to something. People can make choices on their own, so let them be able to make them!     If someone finds something in a book, song, movie, or magazine offensive then they should simply place whatever they were reading or listening to back on the shelf. Whether or not something is offensive to somebody should be up to the person with the item. It depends on that persons maturity. If they are mature enough to handle the material within the item then there will not be a problem. If not, then place the item back on the shelf incase another person is mature enough to handle it.     Furthermore, taking any of the following off a shelf could mean taking potential knowledge off the shelf. As said before books, music, movies, and magazines usually inform their reader. If  one of those is removed, it could be taking away valuable knowledge to that person. If somebody wants to educate themselves on what happened during the @CAPS3 and books or movies about it are taken off shelves, then that person will be robbed of knowledge that they have a right to learn about.     Therefore, it should not be up to anybody but the government to have books, music, movies, or magazines removed from shelves. We can make decisions or our own. Whether that decision is right or wrong should be up to us in the end. The decision of whether or not a book is offensive to one will not effect the entire world. So, it should be up to the person making the decision as to whether or not they want to censor the material to themselves"	7382	7383
5181	2	"Wow, that is really offensive.  Why would they have that stuff out there for people to look at. Playboy. playgirl, porno, and porn website. These are just some of the thing that is out there for to have to see.          Playboy or playgirl to start off. Say you have them at home in your bedroom, or on your bookshelf.  Then you son or daughter, or even your brother of sister finds it finds it. Would you like them to look at that stuff when their only @NUM1 or @NUM2. This is some of the bad results from you buying or geting them.     There are so many relationships that is broken up or ended because of porn websites. Say you come home and find your husband looking up porn. It could be just be the opposite. The end result you two are seperated.     This stuff shouldn't be out there. If this stuff wasn't out there life would be better."	7384	7385
5182	2	"Books that are found offensive in the library should not be removed. The book could have been interpreted wrong, but the book is just like any other one of the many books on the shelf, the only difference is that the content is for a different audience.      Many books can be found offensive to many different kinds of people, but that does not mean we should take it off the shelf of the library. That only means that that book is not meant for that kind of person. Many people read information in different ways. Some @MONTH1 be offended, and others will not. That is why libraries should not remove the book but catagorize it differently.     The book that is found offensive should be placed in a different place in the library and not entirely removed from society. The library should catatgorize books in a way that they are put into age group as well as what type of book it is. The system @MONTH1 be complicated, but if people are becomeing offended by a book, then this is a possible solution for that certain problem.     If libraries are not willing to go to that great of an extent and the book really is offensive in every way, it still shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Removeing the book from the shelve would be violating freedom of speach. Instead, the book have a warning lable attached on the front of the book so people will know that the certain book they are about to read is considered offensive to multiple people.     Many people find many things offensive and everyone will always find some kind of book, magazine, movie or song offensive. That is why we have freedom of speech and the freedom to express how we feel on any kind of subject. If you took that song or book away then we would not have known what that person's opinion is on what his book was about.     So in the end, we should never be remove a book, album, or movie from the library shelf, offensive or not. That is the way the artist or author chose to express his or herself. The book is still a part of history and so is that album or movie. That is the way they chose to express themselves. If the book or album is offensive then don't read or listen to it. Find something else that is not offensive to you. This is why anything from a library shelf should not be removed."	7386	7387
5183	2	"Writing materials that @MONTH1 need to be removed from libraries, in the opinions of some, should be left alone. These books were the works of their authors, and this makes it the authors opinion or work. They were paid to produce these works, and hired to do so. If they were put in a position like this, it should be okay. They were also checked over before published in the first place, therefore they truly are okay to the public that they were itended for. items, such as book, magazines, songs, and other works, should not be removed from the public due to the lack of censorship.           If these works are portreyed as improper, or offencive, then maybe the public should restrict themselves from these things, not the other way around. Lets say a parent does not want their child to watch a @CAPS1 rated movie, this becomes the parents job not the library's. Just because the type of media they chose was not suitable to them does not mean it is not to others, therefore maybe they need to look at a different section of the library. Maybe some people's opinions are different from others, hence the rating systems purpose. The scale is to determine a basic system for judging media and it's quality. People can chose to follow this if they want, and usually the scale will reflect what the producer intended. So why should a library be forced to remove something they bought just because someone is not going about the proper way to see if it is suitable to them.          If someone is paid to produce media of a certain type, wouldn't you presume they were good at it? Another arguement apon this matter could simply be that. If someone is being paid to produce something, they are obviously good at what they do and their products should not be censored, to an extent like eliminating it from libraries. A production company does check the work that comes out of their building, so why is it need to be checked again. People are hired just to check works like these, so therefore the library should not need to remove something that has been checked. Also, if someone is hired to be apart of the media like this, maybe people should learn more about that person before criticizing their work. The work @MONTH1 not be the problem, but the producer is. Maybe the work that comes from someone is okay, just the message or the intention of that person wasn't. Perseptions like this are needed to be taken when looking at media any ways. If it isn't, then what the audience is getting won't make as much sence as it should. Maybe this misconception is what is causing people to want to remove things from a library.         The media should not be censored in a library due to the reasons that have been stated. People are  hired to do a job, and if that job is to produce media, then they must be pretty good at what they do. People are also hired to check works just so this is not a problem. These are also the people who made rating systems. Rating systems have been made for these reasons as well. But above all, maybe it isn't the library's as much as the person who obtained the media. They should have been more careful in what they chose. So the libraries are not to blame for this matter, not so much as the people who were criticizing the products they obtained"	7388	7389
5184	2	"Is it right to remove books, magazines, music or movies from the shelves just becouse one person beleves that it is inapropeat? Yes, there are some books that I beleve that should not be on the shelves at a library but, they should not be removed compleatly. If some parent dose not want their children reading certan books thin they have the right to remove that book from their private sheves at home but not at the libarary.     No, I beleve that we should not remove books from the shelves at a library just because one or two parents do not want their children to pick it up or even see it. If there is a book that you do not want your children to read thin you have the right to tell them that they can not read that and teach them not to pick up books that you bleave to be inapropeat. Katherine Paterson said '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right so does everyone else.'  So if you do not want you child to read a certan book, watch a certan movie, or listen to a certin type of music then you have the right to take it away from them because, you are the parent who has the right to remove shuch things from your childrens life. Katherine Paterson also said '...And then we have no books left of the shelf for any of us.' I take that to mean that if we take all the books off the shelf that we do not want are kids reading then there will be no books for the adults to read.          So if all the books that each parent in the world found inapropeat were removed from the shelves from home, a store, or the library then there will be no books left for any of the adults or the more mature kids. If you realy truly beleave that all books that just one person findes inapropeat and they get their way and those books are removed then how is that fair to those parents who want to read that book them selfs to see if it is appropeat for their child.      There are some books that were taken off the shelfs and are not even aloud to be read in the school just because there are a few words in that book that a kid or a parent might not agree on wether it is because they take offence to that book or to a single phrase in that certin book. It is simmiler to when @PERSON2 removed the natanoual day of prayer not to offend anyone but what about the @CAPS1? In some schools you are not aloud to read the @CAPS2, or pray they want to take religion out of school just because there might be one child or parent that might take offence to it. If you want to take reading certin books, listing to certin music or watching a certin movie and even religion go right on ahead but do it at your home not in public where it can offend other people, because, your oppion of what is offencive to you might just offend other people. So, if you find something offencive just keep it out of your house and not make other people suffer just because of your views and or beleafes."	7390	7391
5185	2	"When mankind was young and primal the stories created by mankind were passed through oral translation. However these stories were subject to decay as the human mind can not recall evey detail that it hears. Great stories that are lost to time will never be recovered. Then written languages were developed to keep better more accurate records of data and stories that were told. Many sheets of written work were bound together into what is now known as a book. Archealogists have found troves of books predating @CAPS1 and many thereafter. These books let us peer into the past with such detail that no human could remember the remarkable events that took place in that time. Books are still published following the traditional use of information transmiter and story teller but they have changed in their content. When many books were written in @LOCATION2 many feared to speak openly about their views through their books for fear of persecution by the @ORGANIZATION2. Today in a more evolved society where people can speak freely some books are published that do not fit everyone's ideaologies. But why should the authors be afraid of this? Haven't we evolved as a people to let people speak their beliefs and not fear prosecution? I think so.     The world today is filled with many religions and beliefs that all share different views of our history and of world events. This can cause uproar when a book is published that does not agree with the individuals belief's. There have been a few books published in the last @NUM1 years that have caused such outcry's that cause people to desperatley want to remove them from the children's eyes. One such book is '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4'. This book is the story of a black man and his master during pre-civil war times where slaves were legal. This book could be considered hainous to readers soully on their morals. The story is graphic at some points throughout the novel and can anger people. Many school's and instituion's have already banned this book from their libraries. Some books such as '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' can clearly be denoted as 'harmful,' or 'inhumane,' to some readers. However, people opposing the banning of this particular book state that 'Our children need to learn from history so they do not repeat it.' And many take this as a valid arguement.      Then again, some books are hated entirely for their content because it does not agree with a person's religion. A more recent example of a book series that some say is, 'unfit,' and 'harmful,' for a child to read is the famous @CAPS8 @CAPS9 series. Millions of people enjoy the book series for it's stories of a young boy at a wizard school. But some people banned their children from reading them because they believe that the book is telling children that witchcraft is an acceptable practice. This extremely violated their religious views and wanted the book series to be removed form library shelves everywhere. This arguement is just as legitimate as the one for '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4'. Though they are both considered 'bad' they are just expressions of the authors mind not intending to brainwash children or start a second civil war. The authors just had and innocent idea for a book and decided to put those ideas onto paper. The authors are just as innocent as everyone else even the protestors to their books.     This new age has brought the front of a changing planet. Connections between people are becoming faster and ideas can spread to a wider audience. This world also has new rules on what people are allowed to talk about. In the @ORGANIZATION1 it is every citizens right to have free speech without persecution. Some other countries have stricter laws than the @LOCATION1 yet are still less strict than they used to be. This new age has also brought about new forms of communication such as, video, text, phone call, internet, and many others. Today's literature has evolved into the digital realm. magazines, books, movies, and music are all now digital. The music today is a new genre and can contain lyrics that not everybody approves of. The artists are just expressing themselves through lyrics and rythm they are not trying to offend anybody. This music spreads to a larger audience around the world and thus causing a larger revolt against it. Today it is much harder to deal with the masses of people that have access to your creations. This can cause people to stop creating their work.      Why? Why extinguish this unknown talent just because some people didn't like it? Many people do not care they just want it gone. Killing this talent is like killing soemone for the color of their skin. It is just wrong. Artists today should not have to live in fear of how their media will be judged around the world. This media should not be destroyed it should be saved for future generations to watch, listen too, or read. That's how we learened about our past right? Why should we try and clean up the media to appease a few people and create the false illusion of a perfect world when there is no such thing. We can not clean up what has happened. We can only learn from it for a better understanding of our fellow man and create the better world we all dream of.      In conlcusion, I think that there is not justifiable reason to abtain the future from learning from the past. We can create our future and we can know what has happened so it doesn;t happen again. Society and the world has changed and all of us need to change with it so that creators of media can do so without fear of what might happen and be able to know that it will be accepted and treasrued for all to see now and in the future"	7392	7393
5186	2	"Have you ever gone to library and asked for a book that they do not have? I know that I have, and that is not fun. Where else do you look? I believe that libraries should not take away books just because they are offensive to some people. We have so much diversity in this great country that almost anything could be offensive to someone.      First of all, writing is our history. It is an insight of how people think, and act in our culture. How do we know about the @CAPS1 empire, and other past cultures? We have learned about them through different writings. If every single library discarded 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3,' because of one word that is used in the book, then that is one less example of how that period of our history was. We need all of the literature to stay acsessable so that we can keep our history, and our country has a special place in history also.     Second of all, the law protects us from the discarding of literature solely beacuse of what is said in it. Libraries are funded by the goverment, so they must set an example of how the law is supposed to work. In the constitution it says that we have freedom of speech. That means I can say whatever I want, and I can not be punished. It is the same way for literature also. Nobody can stop authors from writing what they think, and the libraries need to embrace that, and have a variety of literature. One @MONTH1 not agree with what that piece of literature is portraying, but that does not mean that they can limit it to the consumers because of one's opinion.     Third, there is nobody that is going to make you read what you think is offensive. There are instances where you will be better of if you do see, or read what you do not agree with, but there is nobody forcing you. In school we had to read 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3,' which had some offensive language in it, but nobody made you read it. You would be absolutely better if you did read it, but you did not have to. So you are able to avoid it, but it would be very hard to. If you did end up reading, seeing, hearing something that you find offensive, then be mature about it. Just because someone else has a differing opinion does not mean that they are wrong, and you are right.     So there are many way around this problem of offensive literature. Libraries could catagorize what is more offensive and put that into certain areas, that way people can avoid those certain areas if they are offended easily. There could also be written warnings on the covers of literature warning of offensive content. So in my opinion libraries should not discard of certain literature because of its offensiveness. It is our history and we need to preserve it, we have the freedom of speech, and nobody is forcing you to look at it."	7394	7395
5187	2	"The Censorship of Children      I can see how censorship is an important issue.  Some people including parents and other adults would think many subjects matters should not be read by young children.  There are many views in the world today about personal opinions on every subject you could possibly think of.  I can understand how some things should be restricted from children.  There are things also I think that children should know more about and be exposed to.       On the subject matter of children being restricted from certain things, I respect their opinion.  I certainly do believe that certain particular things pertaining to sex, drugs, and abusive material should be kept from children until a certain age.  Young children should be honestly protected from some of the gruesom facts of life.  Drugs and sex should be kept away until what the parent and/or guardian considers and appropriate age for the child.  So, until the child turns into a young adult, I beleive that some things should just stay hidden.        I believe that on subjects such as history, science, health, and war that people should be informed.  Those particular things should not be kept away from children.  They are the hard facts of our lifes today and it all should be known.  Some people think that the conversation of war should be secretive and kept away from children, but the honest truth is that they need to know what is going on in the world today.  I think that everyone should know what is going on in our everyday lives and what people are risking for our freedom every single day.     I believe that you just can't keep children from music.  It is in all of us and they will express themselves through it and I think they should.  Wherever you go you will have music all over the place, so I believe you should just let it be and let them express themselves through that.  On the subject of movies, if libraries have problems with children watching inappropriate movies, then they should just let only adults check out their movies.  I think that either way they will find some way to watch all those undesired movies.       So, on all of the subjects we have talked about today, people will always have their own opinion on all of these things.  I think that there are honestly a lot of things that are inappropriate for a lot of people to read or see, but some of it they should definitely be exposed to. War should definitely be one of those subjects people be exposed to.  People are dieing for us everyday, so we should know more about it.  So, I do honestly believe that some things should be protected from children, but other things such as music and war should be exposed to them.  Some of the facts of life need to be known and I think we should be the ones to tell them"	7396	7397
5188	2	"I don't think any book, music, movie, or magazine should be taken off the shelves. If it offeneds you then dont read, listen, or watch it. If you have a problem with it then write a letter to the maker and publisher of the item. Ask for an appolagy for what ever is offensive to you and or the public.     I don't think just one person should be able to take something off the shelves. What if someone else doesn't find it offensive and wants to read it? Then they can't. They might want to buy it and add it to a collection of that author they might have.     I don't think anything should be removed from shelves if its a book, music, or magazine because it might be wanted by someone. Just because a few people might find it offensive, they shouldn't read or listen or watch it because others might want to listen, read, or watch it. If something is offensive to you, then don't have anything to do with it, just igore it. Pretend it was never made or produced. If someone ask about it, then say you don't care about it becuase it is offensive to you.     What gives you the right to take away another persons right to do something they want to do? I think if it was offensive the publisher would of made the writer change it. I don't believe anyone should have the right to take away another persons right to do something. If you hear offensive music then shut it off. If you watch something offensive then walk away or shut it off. If your reading something and it is offensive then stop reading it.     If it was actully offensive then why would someone publish it? They might think its not. The reader probly thinks its just the story. I don't think others will think it's offensive."	7398	7399
5189	2	"Do you want your young kids reading books with prophanity, inappropiate sayings, or looking at books with some bad pictures in it? Most parents would say no but some of them can't handle all that because libraries have those kind of books that little kids can get a hold of and read it! Even some books in the kid section are bad for them to read. Some books @MONTH1 have violence and bad words and the kids absorb all that information and think nothing of it, some kids don't even know what they are reading is worng.      To help with that problem libraries should get rid of the books that are like a virus for a kids brain and development because all the kids do is wht they learn and are exposed to. Because of that a bunch of kids have been going the rong way and have been doing drugs, being sexually active, and much more because they might of seen it in a book or something and thought it might be ok to do.     A library shoould be a place where the kids can learn the right stuff and get the right knowledge and not be exposed to all the bad things and the little kid sections she only be educational books and the grade school and middle school books shouldn't be as violent and bad. Like the books kids read for fun should not have all the terrible stuff in it because the kids might want to try it and that would get them seriously injured or maybe even killed.      Now the science books that have some pictures in it should only be shown to the teens that can handle it and won't make jokes or any of that. The science books should also have so e limits of what they put in there and should not be around any kids that could get a hold of it and and @MONTH1 start trouble. So those types of books should only be kept in schools where they are used for educational purposes and maybe in a library far away from the kids so they wouldn't have a chance to see it and the people that need it for educational purposes can use them.     So in libraries the books she be watchesd where they are placed and watch what they have in them and be watched so no kids can get ahold of them. Because if they do and kids can learn from it this world will not be a pretty place to live in the future for the kids."	7400	7401
5190	2	Do you think some books should be taken out of schools and libraries...     No this is the real world and the more you shelter kids and younge grown ups. The more they are going to be ailenated from the real world. I rember reading out loud in class the book 'of mice and men' and in that book there are more @CAPS1 words and other potty mouth words alike it in the book. Our teacher had us the reads skip the words if we choose not to say them out loud. Then why would the author put the words in the help show the @CAPS2 of anger the person you are reading about. Its not like the tv chanels us kids watch are any better. If anything they help us come up with code words for the bad words. If you dont want to read thoose kinds of books then dont choose them. There are book shelfs made for people like you...This is like saying rockn roll is the devils music. But we all know thats rap...But really these are just books if they are going to do anything theyll fill your brain with info not hate. If someone gets harmed reading or comes up with a sceam then we should start taken books out.	7402	7403
5191	2	"In a @CAPS1 society it is important that it's citizens are educated on a variety of material; however, some of this @MONTH1 be offensive to others who do not share the passion for freedom. There is no such thing as partial freedom, and any form of censorship restricts an individuals ability to make their own decisions. If citizens can not make the correct decisions the system would not be able to work. It becomes more difficult to experience unique  material as well. This means that there will be less new and inovative ideas to improve society. Censorship would promote stagnant thought and a less interesting culture.     Individuals who enjoyed the restricted material would feel angry because they would not be able to indulge in their passion. They @MONTH1 also feel that they themselves are being restricted. It would become difficult for them to express similar interest because it to would be censored. Art would become boring because of the lack of unique ideas. Many people would not try to create because what they would want to make would be censored.     It would no longer be possible to make the decision to avoid the restricted content. Individuals who advocate censorship must believe that society can not handle the responsibility of making their own decisions. These people must prefer ignorant comfort to the dangers of creativity."	7404	7405
5192	2	"I think that some libraries should watch what they put in what sections. An adult anatomy book for example, should not be in a first graders hands. Some parents @MONTH1 think thats okay, but others dont want their seven-year-old child looking at body parts that they arent ready to see.     When I was in the seventh grade, I was in a library around town and found a book about sex on the bookshelf for second graders. If I was a parent, I would not want my child looking at a book like that, especially at that age. It could have been misplaced, but the librarian needs to watch for that kind of stuff.     There also is another way to look at it though. Lets just say you didnt believe in slavery, and you went to the library twice a week to see what kind of lives @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lived everyday. Then, one day, while your in there reading, some rude white man yanked it out of your hands and said, 'I believe in slavery, and that offends me, get it out of here!' You'd find yourself pretty angry, especially if you were just looking back on @CAPS3 history.     I think that the librarians just need to catagorize things a little better, so if people dont like the @CAPS4 religion, then they dont have to go into that section. If they enjoy reading about something, then they should be able to read it peacefully. About the 'second grade sex book', that was just not right. A second grader cannot be seeing that. It's what the adults need to do. Watch your children at libraries, and dont put a sex book on a second grade shelf. I think adults have the right to read what they want, they just need to watch what they are doing and who they are 'offending'"	7406	7407
5193	2	"Removing offensive books from the shelves is a good idea, there are some libraries that hold-books, magazines, and movies-that are not appropiate for people, specially children.       At the age of @NUM1, I went to the library to get a book to read, I found my self between all these books, most of them were really interesting, and it was because of the material they had, they were base onhistory, science, and nature... I also found books that talked about race in bad lenguage(absurdity).A lot of the books said they were only for people over the age of @NUM2...I wanted to see if I could get this kind of books, so I went up to the woman at the front desk. I told her I wanted to read those books,she saw the stamp(it said,only for people over the age of @NUM2) she looked at me.'@CAPS1 ahead' she said.'thank you' I said back. I though she was goin to say something like-you have to be @NUM2-but she did not.      During that time I was still a child, and it was so easy to get that kind of material.When you read all this material, you mind gets full of this discrimination against other races and nonsense.That is not the right way to receice an education durind your childhood. That's why I think all this affensive books, music, movies magazines, atc..,most be removed."	7408	7409
5194	2	"The world is full of controversy. Everyone has a different view on different things. Now people are complaining about what is on the shelves at the library. The truth is everyone gets offended. You can't make everyone happy at the same time. There is also nothing anyone can do to help stop disagreements over stupid things. It is the people at the library who decide what is put on the shelves. We cannot please everyone and the people that have problems with whats on the shelf should stay away from it and forget that it's even there.     Someone somewhere is offended by something. Everyone around the world is different and has a different view. What is done around the world is done to make the general public happy. Now does that mean everyone will be happy? No, not everyone is happy. The smallest thing can make someone unhappy and they make others suffer as well. However who ever is offended by the material should suggest to the librarian to have it relocated to an area where there aren't children. When kids are young they catch on to a lot of things very quickly. They should make different sections in a library, like a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section, as well as a family section. That would be best to stop the complaining     The books, movies, magazines, and music are there for all different types of people to check out. Just because it's not right to you doesn't mean it needs to be removed. Something someone finds offensive could be someone elses favorite. And its not fair to take that away just because it offends one person. If the workers at the library find it @CAPS1.K. to put it on the shelf at their job then it should be fine for people to see. If what is at a certain library you don't like, then go find a new one that fits your liking.       People can try to change what is put on the shelf, but what they don't realize is what if their favorite book or movie offends someone else? They don't care about other people, all they see is that they don't have to see that cover again. Thats not fair to everyone who checks things out at the library. There is nothing anyone can do about people being unhappy, it happens all the time.      The world is tough to live in. Not everyone can always be happy. What should be the most important thing should be schools and jobs, not what is put on the shelves at the library. That @MONTH1 be important to some people but it shouldn't be the very first priority. I believe the library should stay the way it is and not worrying about who it offends. If someone doesn't like it than they can get over it"	7410	7411
5195	2	"To @PERSON1, yes some books, music, movies and,  magazines should be removed from libraries, if there somthing thats not readable for young children.I personal think things like that shouln't be in the children section at all. Because some young children would @CAPS2 pick up any book and read it and, that mean the workers don't don't do there job completely.      Some music @CAPS1't be in the libraries, at all because some music have slang , or cursing.Young children @CAPS1't grow up listening to that type of music like raping , r&b. I think thats not a good start off for young children. They @MONTH1 grow up talking like there grown, or maybe talking back to others.       It @CAPS1't never be a movie thats not for a young children watch in  there section.Thats why the parents should always, at all times be by there children watching them pick out a movies.If not then they wouldn't know what there child picking out or watching.Or maybe the parent can pick out some movies and, then ask there child  which one of the movies they would like.        Magazines have things in there that young children shouldnt see, @CAPS2 like other books  thats in the libraries. Young children could grow up to fast looking, listening and, seeing the things thats not allowed for them. Some parents need to have control over there child, because some children have control over there parents and, thats how young children would grow up.          Books, music, movies and, magazines are bad young children some times. Its a bad inflence on there life. So I hope alot of children learn from this whenever they go to a library."	7412	7413
5196	2	"We all have our own opinons. Some like comedies, while others @MONTH1 like science fiction. Some like romance, while others @MONTH1 like scary books. However, when does it come to a point when someone's opinion of a book, magazine, or music is taken too far? Censorship in many libraries and schools is being taken too far and the authors and artists that are censored need to speak up.     Censorship has been around for awhile. People have been censoring movies, books, and magazines since they started making them. The fact is, is that this isn't right. People pour hours upon hours into creating entertainment for the public, only to be taken off the shelf and put in a box for storage. Books and movies normally say what age category is appropriate for that particular item, so libraries shouldn't be taking them off the shelves so children won't watch them.      Lately libraries and schools have tightened up their rules for what should stay and what should go. They censor children books for little things like children not listening to their parents or doing something they shouldn't. These books shouldn't be censored.      Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have take off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that book I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson was saying that everyone has a book that they don't like and they @MONTH1 not want they're child reading, but if everyone takes away those books, and we keep censoring them, then we're not going to have much left to read. We're going to take away the literature from the children that haven't had the chance to read it yet.     Censorship has been a problem for awhile and is still a problem today. Books, magazines, and music are being taken away, unread, and unheard. But if we speak up we can stop the libraries and schools from censoring these items by telling them that we want to read them, and want to hear them!"	7414	7415
5197	2	"Many people believe that books should be removed from the library shelves if material they contain are found offensive. @CAPS3 material could range anywhere from a statement, an action in the story, a portrayal, or even a word. There are many books out there that contain material like @CAPS3. However, there is always more than one opinion to every argument. Should these books that are found offensive be censored, be left alone, or removed completely?     One book that has risen a conflict over the past years is the old novel, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book is found offensive because @CAPS8 uses a word that @DATE1 is taken negatively: the n-word, or as you @MONTH1 know @CAPS8, 'nigger.' The n-word is a word that is offensive to most of the modern @CAPS4 @CAPS5 society. Back in the days of @PERSON1, the author of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' the n-word was practically a harmless way of saying one was as one @MONTH1 call them @DATE1, 'black.' @CAPS8 was just a normal gesture to people back then.     Although, there are people @DATE1 that believe that censoring these kinds of words in literature is neccessary. They believe that replacing these words with words such as '@CAPS9,' would be a better option. In my opinion, I think people just need to be better educated on what these words meant to the people in @LOCATION1's era. They need to be taught that not all people back then used them in a negative fashion. Some did, but there isn't one race that isn't or hasn't been gone against for what they are or were in the past. Everyone is going to be offended some point in his or her life, so why go through all that trouble just to make one small group of people feel better?      Since the n-word was normal for people then, changing the word to '@CAPS9' would not do much help. '@CAPS9' was hardly ever taken positively back then, unless you were a free man. In fact, '@CAPS9' was, and still is @DATE1, a more negatively taken word than the word 'nigger.' The way people used these words -such a the n-word- is just a part of history.      History can not be changed, and should not be changed. @CAPS8 needs to be appreciated for the way @CAPS8 was and how @CAPS8 happened. We can not change the way things happened in the @CAPS10 @CAPS11 nor the @CAPS12, so why should people be allowed to censor the way people in the past used to speak and communicate with one another? By erasing these things from our story books and replacing them with words such as '@CAPS9,' how are we going to be able to teach future generations about how the way of life was many years ago? If we begin censoring, things in our literature @DATE1 a few people @MONTH1 consider 'offensive' material, will be forgotten over time, and people are going to wonder what life was like back in the days of @PERSON1."	7416	7417
5198	2	"In the topic of censorship in libraries, I believe that libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. They should not take things of the shelves because it is offensicve to some people. Here are my reason's why.     My first reason, is some people like comedy's so they get something that makes them laugh, other people like non-fiction books so they get a book thats non-fiction, but those two different people @MONTH1 not like what the others are reading so they stick to what they like. It doesnt mean they have to take every thing they dont agree with off the shelves they can just stay away from the sections they dont like.      My second reason is, if  someone come's in and look's for a book, @CAPS1, or a movie and the library does not have it because someone before that thought it was affensive and it was taken of the shelves, that one person or that @NUM1 people cant get what they were looking for and now they're are missing out on something that was made for anyone to watch, listen to, or read.     My third and last reason is, ive read alot of different books, listened to all different music, and watched all different types of movies and ive done those things with alot of different people. your always going to have one person not like it and think its offensive but next to you there's @NUM2 people who do like it. everyone can't agree on everything.     The conclusion to this article is just except that not very many people can agree on everything so if you dont like something just leave it alone and get what you would like."	7418	7419
5199	2	"Books, magazines, music, movies are these things affecting and or setting a bad example for our youth? Most liraries including those in schools, have books and Magazines that are highly inapropriate for young children and teenagers. The books that are being distributed have contents for adults. They talk about sex and drugs and much more, and these are the books and magazines being put out for our children, our youth to read? Unacceptable!     Being in high school I read a lot of books. Some are not even appropriate for my age level. I've read just about every kind of book that there is to read. Thinking to myself one day I asked myself 'would I want my children to read books and or magazines like this when they are of the age I am now', and my answer was no I wouldnt want my children to read these things.  Because it gives them idea's, and currupts their minds, and in other words giving them a thought that makes them think that it is ok to do those things they find themselve's reading about in those same type of books I've once read.     Movies now a days are getting way worst then befor. Movies are now cooming out with way more sexual content, gang violance, and drugs. If we allow our chilren to watch these movies then we might as well let them take care of themselve's. Little do you know after while they are going to want to be like characters they see in the movies, doing what they see them do, and trying to live the type of lives that they see on t.v.     Music that is being put out in the world these days are just like movie's in a way. The lyrics are explicite, and the message being put out is in a way brainwashing our youth. With the gun violence they talk about, the sex they bragg about, the money they make, and much more. It @MONTH1 come to a surprise or it @MONTH1 not that I see lot's of children and teen's trying to act like the music aritst's that they idolize. I've seen it all people dressing like them, getting their hair done like them, talking like them, acting like them, trying to do what they see them doing. Honestly thats not good. That start's gang violance, drug dealing, sex, teenage preagnacy, disrespect twards parents, and much more. My children might end up doing what they see on t.v. or read in books, and magazines or see in movies and listen to in music. Thats not something I want for them.     With everything being said the worlds social networking and movies, books, magazines, and music is becoming a little to much for this generation as well as the next generation to come along. It gives bad examples set's the wrong idea's and destroy's are youth slowly, so In @CAPS1 the things we read, watch, and listen to are destroying the world, and I think that something should be done aabout these things we do in this thing we call '@CAPS2'!"	7420	7421
5200	2	"I believe that libraries have the right to display whatever type of material they choose to put out. All sorts of people with different interests go to libraries to read and borrow books. They shouldn't be restricted as to what they are reading or watching, no matter the content. The library should be allowed to display just about anything to a certain extent.     When it comes to this, my first thought is the children. I feel that inappropriate content should be put away from all of the kids. If libraries decide to have offensive material on display, it should be kept separetly, just like children's books. You don't find many adults wondering through the children's section. Some adults might even have to ask for the specific literature. Obviously if something is questioning censorship, it shouldn't be out in the open for children to see.     If this specific literature is needed by a student for example, they should have to bring a parent in with permission to borrow it. Some students @MONTH1 need this for a project or even use it to read up on something of their interest.     In my opinion, I think it's perfectly fine for libraries to select what they want to lend out to others. Many people with different interests, jobs, and hobbies all enjoy to read. It's not fair to limit and restrict their choice of entertainment. I feel as long as offensive literature is put away from the children there should not be a problem. How would you like it if someone said you weren't allowed to read your favorite @CAPS1 book? I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries, just keep  wrongful material out of sight when it comes to the children."	7422	7423
5201	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,@CAPS1 has been some question on if 'offensive' material should be taken off the shelves of libraries. In my opinion, i don't think that someone should have to take certain books off the shelf just because it @MONTH1 not be appropriate for a certain person. @CAPS1 are smut novels that are not age appropriate for children, but they don't have to check them out if they don't want to. You can always research and find out what a book is about before you read it. @CAPS1 are men and woman in the world that are very interested or entertained by books that @MONTH1 not be up to standard in what appropriate is. In college, or even high school, you  have to do reading assignments and book essay. Every book that you read won't be fit to please everyone. @CAPS1 are classics that are argued today for being inappropriate for some of the language or content used, but it is a classic and that was the language back then. I had to read To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3 in school, and today they want to get the story rewritten to exclude the use of the word nigger. It is a word that is still used and it is a word that can be used to be hate filled, but in those @ORGANIZATION1, that is how the world spoke. I do think that @CAPS1 should be an age limit on some books, just like movies are rated. If it is a book that someone feels isn't fit for a certain age group, then maybe they should give restrictions. In movie stories, they have things placed in a certain part of the story. Children movies, movies for all ages, and adult films. If a store has issues with the content a book contains and the age group it targets, then they should take the responsibility of setting sections for different books. Books shouldn't have to be taken off the shelf just because some people don't like it or it's message. @CAPS1 are classics that everyone has grown up with, and it wouldn't be fair to take them out for upcoming generations. Thank you for your @NUM1"	7424	7425
5202	2	"I believe that certain things should be censored in libraries, however, not all things that are found offensive by people.  There are many different religions and belief systems in this world and if we catered to all of them then there would be very little literature for people to choose from and they would miss out on many great things.     Books should not have a very strict censorship.  There should be certain rules that they have to meet but if you are really strict with books people would miss out on some of the best novels ever written.  One very good story that could be seen as offensive by someone is 'The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3'.  This story includes slaves, cussing, slang, and killing but it is one of the best books I have ever read.  Just because there were those certain topics doesn't mean it changed my views on any of them.  The things said and done in that book were acceptable in society back then and it gives us a look back into the lives of people before us.  It gives us a story from someone elses point of view while opening our eyes to new things.     Music, I believe, should be censored more harshly than books.  Not all types of music are bad but some are not good for people.   I feel this way because alot of rap music these days promotes harshness towards women, sex, drugs, and alcohol, but rap is not the only type that does that.  If I were a parent I wouldn't want my child going to the library and listening to that type of thing.  If they would have those kinds of music that were more harsh they should separate it from the more appropriate music and let only adults access it.     I feel that movies should be in the same boat as music.  I am fine with everyone being able to get all @CAPS4 through @NUM1 movies but in my opinion, if a movie is rated @CAPS5 a non adult would have to have a parent or adult with them to rent it.  However, the section of @CAPS5 rated movies shouldn't contian nudity because I feel that promotes sex and pornography.     All magazines that don't have nudity or drugs in them, I believe, should be able to be rented at a library.  I don't see magazines posing a very big threat to someone's morals because they are already censored to an extent before they are put on shelves.       There are many different religions and belief systems in this world and if we catered to all of them then there would be very little literature for people to choose from and they would miss out on many great things.  Most books, music, movies, and magazines are okay to put on a library shelf but there are the few that we have to watch out for and keep away from children and teens"	7426	7427
5203	2	"I belive that all kinds of books should be on the shelf becausethey can teach children around the contry. First soultion to this problem can be help by living this books on the shelf at all libraries. Also, by showing kids about this books can help them learn more stuff in life about the tools we need in life. There for we need this kinds of books in our libraries so we can depind on the furture of this contry.     Second soultion to this certain views on censorships in libraries we have is any kid can just walk up in just get a book at any librarie. There should be a age limite on the kinds of books childrn should have at there age. Also, if we would take this books away the kids would learn more in there lifes as ameracans. Right now the @CAPS1.S is not the best in smart skills right now thats way we should keep the books on the shelfs. To sum up i think we should keep the books we have in our libraries todays world"	7428	7429
5204	2	"Do you think certain books, music, movies, etc., in libraries should disappear? Well, my views on censorship in libraries are that, they can put what they want on the shelfs. Libraries are  places of freedom. Taking away certain books, music, movies, etc., in libraries would disappoint a huge ammount of people.     In libraries, your job as a parent is to tell your kids not to go in areas where they shouldn't go. When I was younger, my mom and dad always gave me bounderies as to where I could go, and where I couldn't go. Libraries are for all ages of people, not just children. Therfore, all types of books, magazines, movies, and music shouldn't be censored.     An observation of mine, is that, if people gave bounderies as to where their children are and are not aloud to go in certain areas, then this wouldn't even be a concering problem. I understand the worries of a child getting there hands on a book with violence or something scary, but then all of this bounces back to an earlier statment as to bounderies.     So, in my conclusion, I think it's safe to keep all types of books, music, movies, etc., on the shelfs at the libraries. Adults need to be able to check stuff out there to, not just young children"	7430	7431
5205	2	If i had the right to remove some books from the shelve i would because there are lots of books out there that kids read today and they're parents don't even know that theyread them books and if i had it my way i would have already taken them off the shelve and out of the library because there are several books that i don't read because of my religion for instance there are horror books that i don't read that everybody else reads. If i were to change some things around it would be to first create a new library and put the books in it that i would want my children and other people children to be reading and if they didn't like the changes that i was making then they could just go to a different library because i would be trying to get people to read positive books and not negative books. They are also making books that have alot of foul languages in them and that's where it all starts for little kids because when the kids read them books they think it's okay to curse and they just start saying what they want to when they want to say so that would be the next thing that i would take away because i would want them to be growing up living a bad life style because that's how it all starts and i also would give them books that was talking about drugs because that's how most people mess their lives is because of drugs because they want to be cool and hang with the cool kids but your not surposed to do something you see someone else doing if you see them doing it and they offer it to you just say no thank you and walk away you don't have to stay there in that environment because you are not being forced to do nothing so if you have a problem you with something that happens around you you tell that person you don't do that and your not trying to get involved in that stuff and if they get mad and start calling you names just walk away you did what you were surposed to do so in the long run keep your head up and do what's right for you.	7432	7433
5206	2	"Censorship is a challenge in america. Many people feel like there should be more censorship than there is. It is a growing problem in the world today and it all is opinion based. The internet makes it easier and easier to see whatever you want.           With just a click of a button you can see anything you want you could be twelve and see things that are supposedly censored. If you can do a little math you can see or hear just about anything. Its so simple with the internet.     My opinion on censorship is that its a good thing on certain things. Its also a matter of opinion. What one person views as an aweful horrid thing another could be perfectly fine with.     There are different things people try to censor such as books, music, movies, and magazines. I mainly understand music and movies but not so much books and magazines. music and movies can have language or gore and such that a child should not hear and can be a little mind numbing. With books and magazines though they show what was going on during that time and are a little piece of history and to censor books is to kill a little bit of history.      It is also someones hard work you are trying to throw away. I feel like if a child reads a book they will understand history more and will gain knowledge. Where as the @CAPS1 rated movies children watch offer nothing but violence and sex in their minds which dosent help them at all.      Like I said in the beging though this all opinion based. Censorship will always be a problem and a struggle. people view things differently so as long as people continue to have opinions censorship will remain."	7434	7435
5207	2	"Everyone likes differnt things and have differnt opinions. Were all differnt by the way we act, and what we like to read.  Therefor were gonna read differnt books. Some we like, some we don't.If we didn't like a book thought it should be taken off the shelf, like the author said 'we wouldnt have any books left'. That in my own opinion, I would not like. It could be a book you really wanted to read but someone found it offensive and took it off the shelf. Since we are differnt, someone might find a book offensive and you dont. It all just depends on the person. There are books out there that i've checked out  and my teacher said they were good books. She was correct, but some of the things in the book made me feel weird knowing my teacher had read the book.Nothing offensive, just sexual. Books are not only offensive but @MONTH1 be kinda inappropriate also. I dont think authors mean to offend anyone by their books. There is not a book I have ever read that was offensive. I dont know what would be in a book that would offend me.If your reading a book and you find it offensive or just flat out dont like it then return it! There @MONTH1 be somone out there that reads it, and thinks its one of the best books. There is no need to take that book off the shelf, because you dont like it. Others @MONTH1 enjoy it. Your going to come across books you love and books you hate. If you don't read alot you will still come across a book you don't like, where someone who reads all the time @MONTH1 find they don't like a lot of books. For example you read a book, find it offensive or boring. Check it back in and leave it on the shelf, someone else @MONTH1 come check it out and love it. We all like diffrent things, and have are opinion on what is a good book."	7436	7437
5208	2	"I think that the offensive books and movies should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to people and that there should be no right for people to write those stories that might offend others.      The books I have read and movies I've watched could be offensive to others of a different race, religion, etc. I had never thought much about the books I've read being offensive to others, but in many cases they could be offensive in some way. Stories written in books or made in movies could make fun of or hurt people of a different race or of their religion and they should have the right to remove that book from the shelf if it is offensive to them. For example, a book that has a story about a certain race or religion of people all looking or acting exactly the same, which isn't true then those people could be offended by that story.       If people could be offended by books or movies then those books and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries. Some children who have taken offensive books and movies off of the shelves of libraries and have read the books or watched movies @MONTH1 not understand what they are reading or watching and they @MONTH1 not understand that some books could be offensive to others. I think those books and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries so that children don't read those books that could be offensive to them or others."	7438	7439
5209	2	"To the concerns of those who wished the libraries would be censored, I believe the rights of picking out your own book is great but the young children should have certain books they are able to read. The kids today in our society are exposed to many bad behaviors, in which they should never have to deal with until a later age. Some of the books in the libraries have a reading level set on them for a reason. The children should not be able to read about books, in which teach them dreadful behaviors.     An experience of my own was when I picked out one of the @ORGANIZATION1 books. I came home with this book not because I was interested in reading the book, but because I knew if I read this book and took the accelerated reading test on it I knew I would have met the required amount of points for the nine weeks. My mother entered the room I was reading in and asked for the title of my book. She heard the title and immediately told me the book had to be brought back to the library in the @TIME1. My mother explained to me the book was not a good book for our religion, because of all the mystical creatures within the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 book.     The library has many other books to choose from, the librarians do not have to order the books inappropriate or offensive to people. I am sure there are plenty of other books that are clean minded and unoffensive. The world needs to stay away from the 'bad books' that influence people to do unsafe behaviors. All books that can hurt people in anyway should be banned from the shelves of the libraries. If you want to read the 'bad books', you should have to purchase them on your own. Why waste the money when all it will do is offend or teach the people bad behaviors, which could hurt the community in the long run.     The banning of certain materials in libraries is probably one of the best ideas I have heard in a while. The world needs to stop offending people and stop all of the bad behaviors going on. I have read a few books in which I think should be banned, the world can act now and promote the banning of 'bad books' in the libraries. If you could help out step by step in making the world a better place to live in, would you do it? This is a baby step to making a difference in the world, even though this does not seem like a big deal, if the people did not read these bad materials then they would less likely be able to think of doing the bad behaiors. Let us try to stay away from the books that leave bad influences and read the materials that do not offend anyone or helps you to become a kind, loving person"	7440	7441
5210	2	"As a human being, I have the right to take in knowledge that I can apply later in my life, as does any other living person. A person should not be able to take the oppertunity to experince a graphic situation in a safe enviroment away from another. A library is a place that contains a large mass of stories whether they are fiction or non, and within the many stories some material @MONTH1 be thought too graphic for a young child, even young adults. This graphic material is neccesary for ones developement. If a child were to live a life censored from the harsh enviorment of the @CAPS2 as it truly is, then the child, after coming of age, would eventually enter the @CAPS2 with no preparation for the harsh enviorment it it will be placed in. A few examples, as I will explain further, are: books of @CAPS2 history, fictional books of a person's real life situation, and books thatwould create new ideas in one's growing mind.    The past cannot be completely told without dwelling into the dark half of it. If one were raised in veiwing our @CAPS2's history as simple conquests of country and man, then they would be blind to the desperation some men can reach. An example; @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the @CAPS5 @PERSON1, along with the @CAPS6 power, began a campaign to take over most of @LOCATION1. That is the lighter side of the @CAPS3 with @LOCATION3. If a child were only presented with this information, censored of the horrible things that had taken place, then the child will not know of the genocide of the @CAPS7 population, or of the massive nuclear bombing of @CAPS8, or even of the bombing of @LOCATION2 that had brought @LOCATION4 into the @CAPS3. Sure, a child @MONTH1 have a small metion of it as they learn history, but what if said child were to want to know more? If the library were to have censored their collection, then the child would would only get the information he had already been presented with. One @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS9 does it matter if a child would recieve the full explaination of what had truly happened on those events?' The answer is simple; the past can be repeated if we do not learn from our mistakes.   A library @MONTH1 not see the need for books that contain graphic situations such as one that @MONTH1 contain drugs, sex, violence, or mental illnesses, but in my opinion, these books are neccesary to let a young adult develope a sense for dealing with these situations. We, as humans, cannot deny that the @CAPS2 is filled with these things. It would be wise to allow our children to dwell into the books that will let them experience the situations in a safe enviroment, without them actually going into the @CAPS2 and experiencing it first hand. A person endangers a child when they raise them without letting them experience these things in a safe enviroment, for the real @CAPS2 is harsh. Therefore, it is neccesary for the library to stock books needed to teach the growing community.    It is neccesary for a young adult to create their own opinions on graphic subjects. If a person were to grow up without seeing the both the darker and a lighter side of life then they @MONTH1 not have the ability to form their own moral values. One who does not recognize wrong doings as something that is bad is liable to fall under the corruption evil thoughts @MONTH1 bring. When raising ones child, a person should present the dark side of life to them and teach them the morals of life. Explain to the young that what evil that has happened in the past should not be done again. A library would be a valueble recource in the teaching of these moral values in the education of child, but if a library were censored, the child would not have past experiences to learn from.     Many of my arguements presented are from things that have been said once before, such as; learning from our mistakes in the past so they @MONTH1 not happen in the future, taking the lesser of two evils or even staying on the safer side when teaching a young one the evils of life, and teaching right from wrong to a child before they can incidently develope a corrupt opinion for themselves. In conclusion, I state that a library without censorship is neccesary for the teachings of children. Everyone has the right to see the @CAPS2 as it truly is, uncensored and corrupt. My only wish is for them to learn of the @CAPS2 in a safe enviroment such as a library."	7442	7443
5211	2	"Censorship taking off the selfs at the local libraries and the local stores? The answer to that should be NO! If you turn that statement around and just think about it. Censorship should be tought to every kid that goes through school. If you didnt teach any students on how,why its use you would have alot of people mad at you. There are to many thing wrong with this world to be worried about censorship. Censorship revolves around this world day after day. The people you talk to and and the people you see walking down the side walk delt with this problem in a few ways.      I once took an afensive act from someone who said that the blacks should go back to africa. I had a violent answer to that when that person said that. I told him if their wasnt so many white people being lazy and wont get a job,that there wouldnt be a african american controling the united states. He took that and rethought that in his head that their was nothing for him say.         That paragraph is a first person veiw on how it should been taken But if you thought about it on a younger adault that hasnt learned censorship,how would that takened it how would that person response to it.     In conclusion to end this mess, is to teach younger kids the real life thats going to hit them. Tell them that they are going to have do things that their not going to like. I wake up every day with a smile and say this is going to be a great day,not knowing whats coming at me duting the day.

5212	2	"Cenorship is a key thing and always has beeen.         My view on censorship in libraries is very legit I personally think that it is a good idea. Do I believe that certain materials that are offensive and or inappropriate be removed from shelves yes.Why do i think that inappropriate and or oofensive materials should be taken off of library shelves well keep reading and you will find out.The reason i think that they should be removed is because nobody wants their eleven year old child coming home with a book that only adults are suppose to read. When that eleven year old child comes home knowing stuff that she should not know is where we should draw the line. The nasty magazines and @CAPS1's books and movies, that have girls showing their bodies off sends off a bad vibe to the younger generation.The generation now days copies almost everything the media says or does. If their is a model who is way to skinny and she is a role model to some kids they will try and lead by her example and then they end up getting sick.How bout a famous rapper that does drugs and nothin but trash talk comes out of his mouth the young generation that listens to him will try and be like him and thats why our generation is the way it is and why the young ones are being locked up or killed.Do you want your tweleve year old daughter coming home from school talking about her boyfriend gave her a hickey? No, I personally don't know one parent that wants that. The message we are sending to these kids is horrible the books and magazines that have fantasies of kids having sex in high school and getting married and pregnant at sixteen is ridiculous no kid needs to read something like that but when your child reads that they are going to want to do the same thing that book is saying because thats how this generation is. The music is ridiculous these rappers who make money rapping about sex,money,drugs,and hustlin is what motivates our young generation to do and act the way they do today and that is why they are getting killed and gang banging and getting locked up.This concludes why i think that books magazines music...ETC should be removed from library book shelves."	7446	7447
5213	2	"Do I think that some books should be taken off the shelfs because they are offensive.           No because everyone have different oppionions and different views on what they should have in libaries. A libary is where you go to find out information on anything in the world no matter what it is. Some of the books and magazines and movies are not for young viewers because of them being to reveling.     I thinks that some books should not be for young viewers but they should be watched in a libary of books so they dont pick up books for older adults.      What I think about the music people lisen to is that everyone can choose what music they can lisen to they dont have to lisen to what anyone else likes to lisen to.            What I think about the magazines that are in the libraries is  yes some should not be aloud to be on the shelfs but some magazines are helpful to the world to let people know about whats going on in the world because some people dont like to read books they like to look at magazines.       Everyone has oppinions on what books are good and what books are bad what books should not be on the shelfs and what books should, but I look at it this way we got to learn stuff some how so why not in a libary."	7448	7449

Many people think that if there is something bad in the book, movie, or on the radio then we should stop what we're doing, and go on to something else. But why would we want to do that if we're enjoying it?     All people like to read what they want to read, whether its a book, or a magazine. There might be some bad things in the them, but if you don't like the book, or magazine, then take it back to the library or wherever you got it from, and get a different one. If you don't like the book or magazine, then someone else might. Not everyone is the same, and not everyone has the same taste in books.      If you are offended in any way, then take it back. That's really all you can do. If the story or song or whatever it is, is so offensive, then ask someone if there is something you can do about it of it's that bad. If there isnt, then you'll just have to get over it and move on. We all have our own oppinion.      Is there really anything out there that is too offensive to remove from the shelves? Personally, I don't think so. I have never read or listened to anything that is really that offensive. People around me never talk about anything being offensive. If people think something is offensive to them, I want to see it and see if it's bad myself.     My belief is that we shouldn't remove it from shelves. It's pretty much like art. If you love it then you're going to create it. People have ideas about so many things, so therefore they're going to create it, and make it come alive! So if you don't like it, then get over it. Sorry about your luck!"	7450	7451
5215	2	"Would you like for someone to take a book off the shelve that you liked but the people that work in the libary thought was offensive? Books, magazines,music and movies will always have something offensive that someone else doesnt like. The thing is the world is feeled with offensive things like offensive language. We live in a world with negative things. So why would you remove something that @MONTH1 teach you a lesson help you too learn something.     They shouldnt remove @CAPS1 offensive books from shelves because they are a source of learning and willl @MONTH1 help you be a better person. Say if its a book with drugs achol and it has pictures of what you will look like if you do drugs and how it efects your life that could be offensive to people that do thoes things but also could be influenctial to people who are reading the book. The person @MONTH1 say or @MONTH1 not say thats not what i want to do i dont want to be like that @CAPS1 offensive books can help people realize the good and bad of life.     Have you ever watched a movie and it offended you? Like some of @CAPS1 old movies about slaverly and things it doesnt offend me but it maybe offesive to sum of our grandparents. But those type of movies could also have a bad effect on someone instead of a good one     @CAPS1 are just some ways offensive books and movies etc could impact a persons life. They really should leave those type of books and movies on the shelves so people could learn more about how the world is now and how it use to be"	7452	7453
5216	2	"Why should libraries take books that are offensive off of the shelf when people watch the same things on television too? I go to the library all of the time and if the book I wanted wasn't on the shelf because a overprotected parent thought that it was too offensive I would be a little upset. Taking a book away from a library is like taking someone away from their home just because they did something wrong or used a bad word. I think that libraries shouldn't be able to censor their books because all parents have different restriction's on their children. Not only that, at least they are sitting down and reading instead of having their eyes glued to a television I think that libraries should put certain markers on certain books so parent's know what kind of book's their child is getting. If people griped about half of the things that are offensive on television we wouldn't have any shows left on television because I know that my parent's find half of the things on television offensive.     If you are so worried about what your child is reading maybe you should look the book up and see if it is offensive to you and then decide whether you should let your child read it or not. Which, is way better than, taking that book away from everybody else that uses that library. If libraries pulled every book off of the shelf that was offensive to a certain person in any kind of way I think that the only books we would have left in libraries are nonfiction books and some childrens books. In that case, you are taking away from others just because you think that the book you were reading is too offensive for you or your children to read.      Libraries should put certain markers on books that the parent's might want to know what is in them. Or they could put them in a certain area. Better yet, they could put age restrictions on certain books that have adult content in them so that way their parents definately know what kind of books their child is getting. But taking them away to me that is going a little bit too far with the whole thing. If you don't want your child reading it tell them no and move on. In the end the only thing that you are doing is taking away from the other people who wanted to read that book. Libraries are suppost to have all kinds of books not just the books that certain people think are appropriate. It's just not fair to everyone else who is using that library.     In that case, I think that libraries should not be able to pull books off of the shelves. In a way, I think that it kind of takes away from the library because libraries are suppost to have all types of books and not just the books that are fit for certain people to read."	7454	7455
5217	2	"No, I do not think that books, magazines, movies, music, ect. should be romoved from libraries. I do think that they should be put in a private area for those of age could go read them. People that get offended by what is in those type of books, magazines, movies, music, and ect. sholudn't be in that special section anyway. There are teens and even older people that like explcite books, magazines, movies, music, and ect.     So why take that type of enjoyment from us because there is a couple of people that do not like those type of books and ect. You don't have to take them out of the library just give those types of books and magazines their own section with an authorized personal to check the age of the person entering that zone.     Someone that find explicit books and ect. offensive shouldnt be reading it in the first place. No one should have to suffer for someone else. Those type of books should be put away for the people that like those type of books or ect. For the ones that dont like them shouldnt protest. They should just over look those type of books and ect.     I do agree that no child that goes to library should see those type of movies. There should be some type pf parental lock on those @NUM1 movies for those that are not of age yet. No child under the age of @NUM2 should be able to check out @NUM1 books, magazines, movies, and ect. There sholud be soem type of card that says that they enter that part of the library.     Once again I say that no one that likes those type of books and ect. should have to suffer because someone got offended by it. The books should just be put away for those of age and that those that can handle those books nd ect"	7456	7457
5218	2	"When you go to the library, what do you expect to see? Books,of course, would be the obvious answer. But what if all of the books that could be considered, in any minute way, offensive were to be taken off the shelf? Just about the only books left would be a handful of children's books and informative writing. Well, if left alone, this could be exactly what happens to public outlets everywhere, even though the positive aspects of these media sources far outweigh the negative or 'offensive' features.     To begin with, I'd like to point out that only a small portion of books are considered 'kid-friendly.' @CAPS1 is this? Well, it's mostly due to the fact that the vast majority of readers are mature adults, so respectively the books have more mature content. If we were to remove a book because someone not old enough or mature enough doesn't like what they're reading, then libraries would have to get rid of all of the books. There are simply too many 'offensive' topics in the world to write an entire book without hitting a single one of them.     Another good reason libraries should remain uncensored is because even the greatest of books have just a hint of vulgarity, obscene behavior, or offensive jargon. However, this doesn't affect the book's ability to be well-liked by the readers. In fact, sometimes this is what makes books enjoyable. It should be common knowledge that in today's society you don't see people conversing with one another as if they were college professors, so when a book adds something familiar (and this would probably be something vulgar or obscene) into their novel, it grabs the reader's attention. Also, any good author wants the reader to be able to see eye-to-eye with the main character, and since no one's life is perfect, there's bound to be something 'offensive' to someone in the text. As it was mentioned earlier, there's just too much to avoid to make a book tolerable by everyone.     Finally, the last reason censorship should not be allowed is because that, by nature, humans have a hard time resisting offensive or vulgar behavior, and it is reflected in their writing. Also, when it comes to movies, for instance, the old 'clean' style of movies has long since gotten stale. In these times, the only movies with a rating of @CAPS2 or lower are movies made by @ORGANIZATION1, or simply children's movies. Beyond that, every other movie that's directed towards an older audience has a lot of vulgarity and jargon. Song producers don't write songs that listeners don't want to listen to, and, unfortunately, most of what today's listeners want to hear is the vulgarity. As for magazine publishers, with all the things going on in the world today, what is there to write about that's both interesting AND clean?     To summarize, there really isn't any way to have a library with books full of completely tolerable material, because that simply doesn't exist. If libraries or any other social media outlet were to censor their products, there would be nothing left for anyone. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"	7458	7459
5219	2	"All books, movies, magazines, and music have their own voice and opinion about them. To remove them from the shelves of libraries would be rude to the people trying to give voice to their opinions. Censorship in libraries is something that does not seem right. Books that people find offensive shouldn't be taken off the shelves becuase not everyone is the same; different people have different views. They also should not be taken off the shelves because that would cause even more trouble with the people that think they should stay on the shelves. Censorship in libraries should not be put into action because not all things are offensive to everyone; people should have their own views on things and it wold cause lots of outrage on both parties.     Every book has a voice; a specific way about them that everyone takes differently. No one person is the same, not everyone person has the same views on what is offensive and what is not offensive to them. To have censorship on libraries is like asking someone to take their scarf off at the park because someone thought it to be ugly. To the person wearing the scarf, it @MONTH1 not seem ugly, but to another it @MONTH1 disgust them. When having an opintion, it is only right, it seems, to have the right to be able to voice that and let people think what they @MONTH1.     If one were to think that having an opinion only brings trouble and another to say that even if a book states an opinion, it still has people burning with anger; think of it another way. If censorships on libraries were put into action, wouldn't it bring more bad than good? Of course, the books parents don't want their children to read or the extreme religious or political person wouldn't have to fret with their image in the general public, but than no one would care as much as they do now. People might get more angry than happy when they can't look at others opinions to choose what they want to think or even write their own opinion for others to have as a referance. Maybe it is better, in the long run, to have an opinion than to have it blown away like dust in the wind.     Every book, magazine, movie, song, or newspaper sometimes, has a voice and opinion about them. To remove them from the shelves of a library because some people do not think this is something that does not seem right. Everyone has their own opinion either to share or to state and having to hold that back because of other people who find that offensive also does not seem too right. So, having censorship on libraries should not be put into action because everyone has an opinion and just the fact of it becoming something would anger more people than it would excite. That's how important the freedom of speech is."	7460	7461
5220	2	"Certain materials that people @MONTH1 consider as offensive like, music, movies, magazines, etc., some of them are good for adults and no for kids, maybe because there is violence or something that kids must not know. If we think in the fact that they have to be removed from the shelves, there will be no freedom for people who made them, so they will be restricted of doing certain things that they like. This kind of materials must be in certain kind of shelves, like in a @CAPS1, there is sections where you can find books, music, etc., and they are divided; for example, kids section, teenage section, and adults section. Some people is just concern about the fact that maybe their children will read it and learn the bad things that are found in that 'offensive' books, but parents must be very careful about what their children do, also a good teaching from the parents is a good way for the kids to know what are they doing, and they will know what they do in the future and if it is bad or not. Some materials are just bad, but some people still like it, maybe they feel identified with the thing that they are reading, listening, or watching. So a good thing that maybe is consider as offensive have to be classified by their rate, like the movies are rated"	7462	7463
5221	2	"Nothing should be taken away from someone elses knowleadge. @CAPS1 example why I don't think stuff should be taken off the shelf at a librarie is because, what if people are reseaching and you need something, but someone else got offended by it so they took it off. Its not far to the person that is researching. Another example why I don't think they should get taken off is because if you trying to learn about something the librarie is a common place to go, to read about it. That also wouldn't be far to the other person.     Leaving them on shelfts,@CAPS1 example of why they should leave book that can cause offence to something is because, @CAPS2 kids are more advansed then others and would like to read about older stuff, which is usally okay.If you don't want your kid readnig that type of book, dont let them check it out, it shouldnt be taken away for anyone else. Another reason why I think they should be left on the shelfts is because if others are going to get offended by something that people read, then just dont read it again. Other people might wanna know about it, and if they are taken off the shelfs it will be taken from them.     If people are getting that offensive over something, then they shouldnt be taken off the shelfts completely they should just be put on a seperate shelft, taken away from all the other books.     Magaizene staying on the shelfts, @CAPS1 example why I think magazines should stay on the shelfts is because they are something to read in your spare time. Another reason why they are okay to stay on the shelfts is because people can also learn from the pictures. They should just be kept clean.     @CAPS4's, I dont think @CAPS4's should be taken off either. @CAPS1 example why I don't think so, is because if they are blind how else are you going to be able to listen to the book. Another example of why @CAPS4's should stay on the shelft is because if you heard of a band and want to listen but dont want to buy it, you can go rent it. The only thing is I think they should all be clean. Don't take away from someone elses knowleade because others dont like it."	7464	7465
5222	2	"Books, music and movies, everybody likes books, people read them for fun or just to pass time. There are some books that I believe should not be taken off of shelf's for the simple fack that they are horible not in a scary way but just horible. Movies, music and books can be taken off the shelf and looked at and put right back after they have already been there for centries.      This classifies these books, movies and music as bad material, or people have lost intrest in them weather it is because they are about drugs, sex and alcohol. This being said nobody would want there ten year old kids going down to the library, kicking back and cracking these books or taking these tapes home to lisen to. Thinks like these are to be kept away from kids, this is the last thing we need kids running around with drugs or premaridle sex.     I believe that these books, movies and music should be taken off the shelfs and away from the public. If you wish to see these materials you shall ask only if you are of age. Eventually when kids get into high school or even college they will want to see the books they were prohibited from for years, this is ok. Being that these kids have grown up and are on the right path. They are not already brain washed by the narrator in these books, music and movies. They will know to do no such thing as drugs and other things that are pronounsed in these materials.      All of these problems can and will be avoided if they are just taken off the shelf's and away from these children. the message that i am convaying is simple, this world could be a better, peaceful place to live. Think about this, kids that are @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3 and up didnt just wake up one day and say I think I want to do some drugs or I think I might kill someone today, no they didnt...      They woke up everyday watching the news and or hearing about it through books, movies and music, this being said if all of this was eliminated from these kids livies and there family was happy non violent than this world would be trouble free nobody would be killing anyone."	7466	7467
5223	2	"In @CAPS1 we have the freedom to do whatever we want. There are laws we all have to follow, but we can read, listin to music, watch movies, etc., to our liking. So therefore nothing should be taken off of shelves if they are seen as offensive.     There are some books, music, or movies that would not be appropriate for all ages, but that is why there are ratings or restrictions on them, so a child is not following the same thing as a adult. Some people @MONTH1 not want there child in school to read something because of there relgious beliefs or beliefs in general, but there are alternatives to get around that.     We each are a individual and @MONTH1 not like the same genres as other people. Not one thing should be taken off of a shelf, because if you don't like it someone else @MONTH1 really enjoy it and brings happiness to them. If one person finds something offensive other people should't have to give up the genres they enjoy.     Everyone has different views on everything. One person @MONTH1 not think a thing is wrong with the style that the author is writing in, or the type of music the artist is composing, but then again someone might think it is the most vulgor thing they have ever seen.      Everyone has different interests. If you find something interesting you are going to follow it, you're not going to let anybody tell you differnt. That is the beautiful thing about @CAPS1 We have a right. So therfore nothing should be taken off of a shelf if it seen as offensive, beacuse someone could enjoy, or learn something from it."	7468	7469
5224	2	"Citizens have the right to choose the books, music, movies, magazines, etc. as they please.  If a citizen knows that they will find one the above offensive they should not choose that item. People know their own morals and if something is obviously against your beliefs don't choose it. Why should everyone else suffer because a few people find a book, music, movies, magaizens, etc offensive?     First of all, when you enter a store or library to get a book, music, movies, magazines, etc you usually read the back of the item to see what the item contains. If a person knows they do not like the content of the item don't rent or buy it. Most items the have some source of entertainment have age groups that the item is meant for or they have a rating and if it don't fall into your category find something that does suit you. We usually know what kind of genre we are entertained by and we choose things in the same category, that doesn't mean you are forced to choose something that you don't want.         Secondly, some say children who go to the library are exposed to offensive books. Well, I say that those children know what their parents would or would not allow them to read. As a parent you should keep track of what your child is reading, watching, or listening to. If certain language or use of literature is against your beliefs then you should know what kind of music you like. For example, if you are a religious person who does not believe in volgure language I do not believe you are going to get a @CAPS1 by a rap singer. If you do not want your child exposed to nudity then I suggest that you look at the movies rating and see if it @NUM1 or @CAPS2-@CAPS3.     Lastly, certain groups of people do not find vulgure language, graphic content, or nudity offensive. They find certain genres interesting that others do not and that is their source of entertainment, why should their entertainment be taken away because of someone elses thoughts? Yes, some of the content is unappropriate to some but it is freedom of choice. Young children are not allowed to by movies that are @CAPS3 above their age levels. Parents are usually at stores with their children when they buy music, it is the job of the parent to monitor their child.     People in the @LOCATION1 have a choice on what they want to read, watch, or listen to and it is not a choice made by anyone else but, ones self. I do not agree with the fact that because you do not want your child to be exposed to certain information that everyone else that does want to be entertained by that information should be punished. Just because people do not agree with the use of alcoholic beverages, do they get banned from the shelves of stores? No, they don't because some people do like alcoholic beverages and not everyone suffers because the likings and dislikings of people."	7470	7471
5225	2	"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are a few books in the library that some don't think highly of.  These books should stay in the library .  If you don't like a certain book, then don't read it.  @CAPS1 @MONTH1 not be a lot of people that like these books, but @CAPS1 are some people that are interested in these books.  Books that @MONTH1 not be quite suitable @MONTH1 be the kind of book that can help someone's views in life.       If you don't like to read books like these then @CAPS1 is no reason to get upset about it.  What you should do is just not pay attention to them and don't read them.  @CAPS1 is not a law or a person that can make you read a book that you truely are against.  If @CAPS1 is a book you look down on, then don't read it and then you won't have to worry about what  is in that book.  The best thing a person could do that truely dislikes such a book would be to forgit about it and read @CAPS1 kind of book.  Those people wouldn't think it was fair if they took away books that he or she liked.       Some people enjoy to read these books.  they look at them and it just fits their character.  It @MONTH1 show them how the real world is, and people @MONTH1 need to realize these things for their future.  Maybe someone in their family has acted a certain way and is bad now.

All books should stay in the library.  Sure @CAPS1 are some books that people really disagree with, but that doesn't mean we should get rid of them.  Those books that some people don't enjoy @MONTH1 be the only books that others do enjoy.  These books can have a big affect on how a person acts and views their life.

5226	2	"There are some books that are thousands of years old.  These books were written in a different timeframe then what people live in today.  One of the most famous old books on shelves is the @ORGANIZATION1 and is one of the most popular selling books in the world.  Although the @ORGANIZATION1 is found offensive by people, they have not been removed from the shelves.  Libraries should not censor books, music, movies, and magazines.     The first reason why offensive material should not be removed is because every book would be absoulete.  Books are written on a variety of topics which someone would find offensive.  A book that is defined offensive is the opinion of someone.  There is no records to show that a certain book is the most offensive, it is just someone's opinion.  A few people would find a child's book offensive because it is mindwashing the child.  All the reasons people have are just their assumptions.     The next reason why censorship in libraries is not a good idea is because it would cause job loss, economic trouble, and lose a safe place for kids.  Libraries are places that some kids hang out who are not playing sports.  These kids would not have books to read if there were taken off of shelves.  There would also be jobs lost if there was cenorship in libraries.  A library would contain less material for the workers to take care causing less people to help.  As a result of the jobs lost there would also be economic problems in the community.  The libraries make money off of the late fees they receive from material turned in late.  People in the community would have to go to a store to buy a certain book that might be offensive to someone else instead of reading it for free at a library.  There are some people that do not have the money to buy the book they would want.  Job loss and economic trouble are intertwined with each other.     Offensive material should not be taken off of the shelves because it would destroy history and people's imagination which leads to new inventions.  An example of history that would be destroyed would be books about the @CAPS1.  Books written over the @CAPS1 would be offensive because of the cruel treatment the @CAPS3 faced.  There are also pictures in these books that are sick to see.  History in books provide examples for people to follow so that they do not repeat history twice.  Books help people express their imagination in a unique form.  Imagination eventually leads to possibly new inventions that could help society.  The loss of imagination would lead people to stop striving to reach their goals.     Music, books, and magazines should not be censored from the libraries in communities.  These materials are only offensive to the people who do not like them.  Some materials like the @ORGANIZATION1 have been on shelves or read for hundred of years.  The sales from a @ORGANIZATION1 are much greater than that of any other book.  Books have been around for centuries and have not been censored from people, so why should they."	7474	7475
5227	2	"Some people like books, movies, music, and magazines with offenses in them. Personally, I do not. I believe that if there is bad material, or material that upsets or hurts someone in these items then they shouldn't be on a shelf at a library.     Offenses like racism and porn are both not good things that occur. They both cause many problems throughout the world. So why should we be putting it on shelves for anyone to see or hear about? We don't want people to think that it is a good thing when it's not.      Of course people do have a choice in what movie, or book they select, but what if it's someone who dosn't know what might be in the book or movie. They could be naive and not know what it is until they read or watch it and then they find out. That is not good for somone, especially if they are young. For example, I have gotton a couple of books from the library that look like a good books. Then I start reading it and it comes to a part where two people are making love. Then it goes into detail. I didn't know that the book was going to come to that. Then I wish I wouldn't have gotton that book.      Another main point is rap music. Some of it is not to bad. Alot of it though, tells alot of personal things that you are supposed to share with someone. I have observed that alot of rappers are @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So some people are racist because they believe that all @CAPS1 @CAPS4 are that way.       If they still put out offensive items on shelves of libraries and stores, then they should at least make a section for those kind of things. It isn't fair for someone to have to see these things when they don't want to. It would be alot better off if they just eliminated them all together"	7476	7477
5228	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are all different things that people use every single day.  Many of these @MONTH1 have things that parents might not want to have their chilcdren read or @MONTH1 just not like to read themselves. In my opinion these materials should not be removed from the shelves just becsuse they are found offensive to some.      There are many different books that have content that parents might not want their children to be learing about at a young age. If a parent does not want their child to read something that they believe is wrong they should not let them take the book off the shelf in the first place. Just because something is offensive to one person does not necessarly mean that is offensive to someone else.  Some books that were written during the time when slavery was really big that are available today usually contain some words that some people @MONTH1 not agree with in todays society. In my opinion if they do not like what is being said then they do not have to read that book. For example in my classes if we are reading a book that contains words that the teachers do not agree with as a class we skip over the word or words to make sure nobody is offended.  Just because there are a couple of offensive lines in a book does not necessarly mean that it is a bad book to read.      Music is one of the main materials that people tend to believe contains bad content. Many different songs do have words that people believe should not be aloud to be said in a song that anyone can listen to.  That is why some songs are changed for the radio because some radio stations will not play songs that contain explicit language in them.  For example in my case my parents blocked songs on @CAPS1 so that i cannot buy songs that contain explicit languange. This is a way for parents to have control over what their children listen to. There are many different ways that people can get music without explicit languange and if they cannot nobody is saying that they have to listen to that music.  There is lots of music that people do not find offensive and people could listen to that if they please instead.       Movies are another big thing that many people have a problem with and that is my many movies are rated. Movie companies rate their movies so that people know ahead of time what the movie contains. Once again some people might find some comments in movies to be offensive but there is not anyone that is forcing them to watch that movie. If a person does not agree with what a certain movie contains that does not mean that everyone else feels the same way.  Just because on person does not agree with what a movie contains does not mean that it should be taken off the shelves.     There are certain magazines that contain information of different things that some people might not want to see or have their children see at a young age. For this reason to buy  many different magazines you must be a certain age and magazines like this are usually harder to find. Many libraries would not contain many magazines like this in the first place but if they did, no one person should have the right to remove it from the shelf because they do not agree.     In my opinion books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. Not every single person believes in the same things so it would be wrong taking the right from someone to read or listen to whatever they like"	7478	7479
5229	2	"Offinsive creations offf shelves?      '@CAPS1!!!!!!!!!They have taken my favorite magazine off the shelf. I think they just did that because the publisher was talking about people in bad way, but they still should not have taken it off the shelf.' @CAPS2 is what i would say if they took offensive thinkgs off the shelfs. In life most things, especially music and magazines, can be offensive but in the music, books, etc., it tells the truth some times and its just someone saying theur opinon on something. I think they should keep nonoffensive and offensive things on he shelf.      It is true, most music is not age appropriate for most kids these days. There are kids in @CAPS2 time that walk around singin about sex, drugs, or killing somebody. I am sure that parents donot want their kids speaking in violence like that. Yes, most parents would not let there kids listen to certain music, others would just let them listen to it and tell them that it is just a song and you should not go out doing something a song is talking about. With @CAPS2 offensive music i think it all comes down to how the parents raise their kids. If  yuor child is not like the music they listen to then the parents should just let them listen to the music they like. every body has their own style.     Also, I would think for a child to go to the library they should be with their parents and their parents would have to check the book out for them. If a pearent sees his/her child try to pic up an inapprpriate book they should explain to them that they are to young to be reading things like @CAPS2. When I was fourteen my mother had @CAPS2 book that i wanted to read. She said i was too young to read that book because it alks about sex. When i turned @NUM1 she finally let me read the book and now i finally understand why i could not read that book when i was younger. When she said it had sex in the book i thought she meant it would say something like how somebody was going to have sex and start talking about something else. When I read the book it gave details to how they was having sex and I realized my mother was right I was too young at the time.      Next, the magazines. I think offensive or not that the magazines should stay on the shelfs bcause they are very informative. They let you know everything that is happening with the famous people,what movie will be coming out soon, and you find good insiders. It seeems like the world would be a bit different with out offensive things in life. We need offensive to balance out all the good.      Finishing with my final thought, i would tlike to say we should keep the good and the bad on the shelfs. I think if we had just all nonoffensive things it would be more boring than it is with the offensive things. Like i said good and bad balances everything out just right. If the press, media, rappers or singer, writters even drawers, have something offensive to say it is okay because it is a good thing behind every bad thing."	7480	7481
5230	2	I strongly believe that the libraries should  have to take somethings down because things that are offensive to one person maybe funny  to other's. So yes they should take the offensive things of the shelves just to avoid alot of conflict & arguments fight's & things like that.    I remember I had an experience before with something similar  i was at a school in @LOCATION1 and some kids had wrote somethings on a wall and there were a whole lot of other kids looking and staring at what the kids had written on the wall just sitting and having a good time laughing at it while i just sat and stared because it was very offensive towards me i wanted to do something about it being on the wall but people just tried to make it seem as if it were just a little joke.You see you never know how something feels until its done to you just like i reamember when @CAPS1 magazine had @CAPS2 james on the cover that started up alot of contriversy because the way he was on the cover it was showing like he was some type of animal and people really didn't like that.                                     I read in a book once that black people should go back to where they came from it was saying alot of really nasty things about black people and it was in a librarie now im not making this a racial thing im just saying what i read and it was just sitting there as if this is ok for people to say and it can be in a public place like this i didnt like it one bit but thats just me now some people @MONTH1 find that book amusing or just down right funny but to me it was a very offensive thing	7482	7483
5231	2	"Cencorship in libraries isn't a big issue for me. If there is a book I find offensive or music, or a movie, or anything else for that matter, I won't check it out. Things I find offensive and tings others find offensive could be completely different.           Libraries are organized in sections, like there is an adult reading section, a childrens reading section, and maybe even a teen reading section. Why would anyone let their young child go looking for a book in the adult section? I know I wouldn't. If libraries can take the time and separate the books so that different age groups have thier own section, can't people take the time to appriciate it?     Libraries have a wide variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. If you find a book or someting of that matter to be offensive, I say you should just put it back and move on to something different. You shouldn't go complaining to people about it, that probably won't solve your problem. Something one person finds offensive could be another person's favorite movie. So would it be fair to take it off the shelf because one person finds it offensive, no it wouldn't be fair at all.     Knowing what they're interested in, why would somebody go looking in a section they might find something offensive in. I know I'm interested in books about the paranormal, so i wouldn't go looking at the book about flowers. I don't think flowers offend anyone, but like everything else there could be someone. If everyone who found something offensive, got their way and it was taken off the shelf, there wouldn't be anymore books for any one to read.     Libraries have a good grasp on cencorship, I think now it's the our turn to look past some of the things we find offensive, because there could be someone out ther who has read it a million times"	7484	7485
5232	2	"I don't think censorship in libraries is the best idea because some people like reading books and magazines that tend to have offensive writing in it. Some people find them interesting and like reading and listening to those kinds of things. A lot of music today have offensive words in them but people still like listening to that kind of music.      Taking the books and music that are found offensive off the shelves also restricts the authors freedom of speech. The author has the freedom to write about what he or she thinks or wants to write about. The author also @MONTH1 write about life experiences and events that @MONTH1 be offensive but interesting to the readers.      Everyone likes different kind of music and books. Taking a lot of materials off the shelves @MONTH1 cause people to not come anymore or not be interested in reading anymore. Some people enjoy reading or listening to things that probably shouldn't be heard but they find it interesting and enjoy it.      A lot of stuff has already been cencsored today. Most songs that you would find in the library that have explicit content are already censored and taking it completely off the shelf would be wrong in my opinion. If people are listening or reading explicit content, they know what they are doing and are  doing it for a reason. No one goes to a library to listen to music that they don't find interesting or like. Taking that off the shelf would cause people to not go to the library anymore.      I believe that these materials should be kept on the shelves for people to be able to enjoy what they like. People have the right to listen or read what they please"	7486	7487
5233	2	Yes I do. Because you don't want your kids growing up to do the same you did or listening to same thing you did because might want kill somebody like the song be saying.I wouldn't tell don't listen to them because that would make me a hippacrit. I would just tell my kid just don't nothing bad or don't go to jail for nothing stupid. I would my child a better person then I was so he can become a good man for his wife and kids and tell son/ daughter to do the same. Magazines if it is a nude magazine tell him/her to give me that and I don't want you to ever look at anything like this again. But thats my opinion people might think different for but like i said before thats my way of keeping my kids out gangs an drugs that would be good for me an the family I don't want to see you make bad decisons like I did.	7488	7489
5234	2	"Since mankind has been able to form an opinion, someone else has taken offense to it.  It is nearly impossible to have an opinion that everyone agrees with.  No matter how lovely it would be if everyone was happy with what another person thought or expressed, it is not practical in the slightest.  However, one of man's basic rights is the right to express himself, and censorship takes this away.  Certain materials, such as books, movies, music, or magazines, should not be removed from the shelves if found offensive.     Parents @MONTH1 be concerned for their children's sake when it comes to the censorship issue.  With the internet and media of today, it can prove challenging to protect minors from sensitive material.  While complete censorship is rather ridiculous, it is as prudent to limit access to books, magazines, and websites just as it is to deny children under the age of eighteen access to an inappropriate movie without parental consent.  Limiting access, though, doesn't mean to eradicate a piece of art.  Adults should have the choice to be able to see what they want to, and parents should be allowed the choice to determine what their child is exposed to without the government limiting their options.     People of different religions can find many things made by people outside of their religion to be unsavory.  If some forms are found to be unsuitable by a major religion, then they can have the power to remove the offending work from the public eye.  However, doing so is a direct violation of the separation of church and state.  If the government is allowed to choose what we can and cannot see, and the government is dominated by those of a certain religion, then the freedom of religion and many more freedoms will be overlooked.     If the government does not have some control over a country, then it is likely that chaos and anarchy would ensue.  However, too much control would lead to a dictatorship.  Either option is undesirable, but if our country is allowed to have control over what we see and hear, then we are quickly headed towards the latter of the two.  @CAPS1 is a country that was founded on the belief that mankind has basic rights that must never be violated, and if those rights are destroyed in an effort to be 'politically correct,' then our country stands for nothing.     Censorship of certain materials that are found to be offensive is a direct violation of our rights, and should be stopped.  Everyone has something they find offensive, but if they take the choice to have it removed, then, as Katherine Paterson said, our shelves will be empty.  Our culture will be eliminated.  Everything that makes @CAPS1 great will be gone.  Mankind has opinions that others will find offensive, but at least he will have the freedom to give them to the world."	7490	7491
5235	2	"I think katherine is wrong and in some ways and right in other ways.I dont think they should take the books and etc., off the shelves if they are offensive. I also think that people have there own say if it is bad or offensive. I think that you have a right to pick up the book or movies and if it offensive to you than dont get it. Also people have there own likes and differences, so some people @MONTH1 think it is offensive and some @MONTH1 not.    I as a person think if it is offensive to me than i wont look at the book, or listen to the music and etc. I dont think you should punish everyone just because everyone had diffrent likes. I agree if you dont like it than dont look at it just like i said. There are people out there that likes the crazy offensive stuff but you gotta stop and think it might not be offensive to them. I have rented a movie and i read the back i relized that it was nothing like the reading, i did stop watching it cause it was really offensive and cruel.       I think the libraries need to watch what they put out there. There are little kids that dont need to see offensive things.I also  believe that little kids need to stick in the kids sections. I have been in a library that has diffrent section to show where the different types of books are. There are many different types of books and you got to watch what you read and see.       In katherine paragraph i think she is right when she talks about removing the books off the shelf, i believe this is not right. I agree with her because some people might like these books and if you take one off than ther will be no books left on the shelf for any body that likes them types of books.     I think you should leave all types of books, movies,etc., everyone has there different thoughts on what type of books they like. I think you should not punish everyone because you never know what types of books, movies people will get. I do believe that if a movie or book is offensive than dont pick it up just leave it on the book shelf. There are many types of books and movies and etc. out ther for everyone. If everybody was the same the world would not be like it is today. So leave the books and etc., out and if you dont like it keep walking so everyone wont get punished."	7492	7493
5236	2	I thinks that the story is about if you don't let children read the are never like to read books.They should say that kid read more book then every one in the country.But they should get a lot of time to read book.Pepole don't get alot of time to read beace the have to go to school the yhave to workand they have to sleep. But their should be more time to read.	7494	7495
5237	2	"I do not think it is right to have books, music, movies, magazines, etc. without censorship on them in libraries.      Many parents bring their kids into libraries to show them that reading is fun, and the library is a nice place to sit and read a book. By having obscene books, music, movies, magazines, etc., it has a big affect on kids, and how they are going to grow up.     Whenever I go to the library with my family, I do not want to read, hear, or look at anything that would be offensive to me, or other people. I have a little brother who loves to read, and I don't want to have him go into a library and accidently pick up something that has obscene stuff in the reading.     Certain books such as a book that makes fun of someone for being black, white, fat, skinny, etc., is part of the reason that there should be censorship in libraries. By having people read how its bad if you are fat, or you wont fit in if you are a different color, causes people to want to change how they look. Just by the influence of a book would make someone want to do that, and its wrong. If a kid sees a type of book like that, it could possibly lead them to being self concience of how they look.     Once while going into a librarie, I went to go look in the teen section, and there was a book about a girl who was not skinny, and she starved herself so she could be skinny. The book was all about how it is fine to starve yourself to look a certain way. I was stunned by that. That book could be the cause of a girl or boy that will go home and starve theirselve for days just to loose weight. It's not right to have that type of books, because the little things in life make the biggest impact.     What does not having censorship in our libraries say about our country? That it is good to have that type of stuff? It's a horrible thing to have other people think that about us. By making the world a better place the solution just might be adding censorship. It would not only make libraries a better place to go to, but also make our country be a better place.     Although other people have a different opinion on adding censorship in libraries, my opinion is to have censorship in libraries. All over the world there is already offensive stuff everywhere, so why not make the library a safe enviornment for everyone to go to to read and learn more. It will help children to grow up in a safe environment, and also for making the world a better place"	7496	7497
5238	2	"I believe that offensive material shouldn't have to be removed from libraries because something that could be offensive to you, could be very interesting to someone else.     Anytime that I have visited a library, I always look for the book, magazine, etc. that interest me the most. I'm not a kid that gets easily offended by much of anything, but if i do see something that could be at all possibly offensive to myself, I probably won't read it. Like the author @PERSON1 said, ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--- that work i abhor--- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' That quote is saying that @ORGANIZATION1 has the same right and power to take that said offensive book from the shelf, but it is your choice if you want to pick it up or leave it alone for the next reader. I have never once felt offended by the books in the library, since I only read the ones I want to read. If i was ever to pick up a random book and find it offensive why would I keep reading it. Again, @ORGANIZATION1 has the same right to pick that book up, but they also have the same right to put that book back down.     Offensive material shouldn't be removed from any library because @ORGANIZATION1 has a choice to read it or not. You don't have to read just a random book from the library, just pick the one that best interest you."	7498	7499
5239	2	I think the libraries should not removed materials from the libraries. It should be the people choice to pick what they want to have. It not give the people the freedom to pick what the want to have. I think they need to leave the book alone. It is their choice to read it if they do not like it they can put it down.     For the little kids the parents should pick what the can read	7500	7501
5240	2	"Fowl language, innapropriate scenes, and unexpected words can really effect anyone in the world today.  You are expected to just know whether what you are reading, watching, or even listening to is good for you.  There are warnings on movies and songs, but is that truly enough to keep young viewers and listeners from staying away from it?  Censorship is around for a reason, and I believe that it shouldn't be abused by anyone.      Although I am a teenager, and like most teenagers I don't follow all the rules, oddly enough censorship is something I am completely for.  Being the eldest of three I think about what I know is out there for young ears and eyes, and it doesnt amuse me.  I want to desperately watch out for my younger brother and sister, letting them be surrounded by explicitness is not an option.  I see everyday what the world is turning into, and what is becoming of our country.  I've been effected by the books that I have read, movies I have watched, or songs I have heard due to the fact that they portray the wrong message.       Drinking alcohol, smoking, using inappropriate language, and sex is what fills the news stands, billboards, shelves, and music devices.  The more open these ideas are, the more they will be easy for young children and underage teenagers to become accustom to.  Censorship is around to protect you and nothing else.  Giving out bad influences only harms the society instead of helping it, I doubt that is what most people strive for.  Im observing kids at younger ages get involved into things they shouldn't be involved in, because of what they are used to seeing or what they can easily get ahold of.  This is only because censorship is not as effective as it needs to be.  Censorship is especially important in libraries, its an easy process to retrieve something not suitable for you.      Libraries have thousands of books ready to be taken home and read.  With a library card, those books are free and you can get one anytime you'd like.  It is an incredibly simple process.  Censorship needs to be taken very seriously when its a matter of a book in someones hands, the wrong persons hands in this case.  If there is a book, movie, magazine, or type of music found offensive, I believe one hundred percent that is should be taken off the shelf.  You never know who the next person to read that book will be, and whether or not it will make an impact on their life in a bad way.  It is much better to be safe than sorry.     Censorship is around in the society today, but it is definitely not as effective as it needs to be.  The world is changing, and we want it to change in a way that will help us, not hurt us.  Keeping the bad out will only bring the good in.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that"	7502	7503
5241	2	"Do you beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive? Well I don't even if some books are not sutible for sertain ages. The parents should be abel to control what their kids read. If they let a kid go into the library by themselves they will probably most likelypick out a book that is bad for them and the parents blaim the library for having them when they should be blaiming themselves for letting their child go into the library by themselves.     Most parents don't like books being in the library that are about drugs, violence, and stuff like that. Well parents can control what their kids read if they go into the library with them an help them pick out books that are in their level. I mean most parents don't care what their kids read an then they try to blaim everything bad they do on the library for having them books in their for them to read. Those types of books in their are for teens and adults because they are interesting to read. I would rather read one of those books rather than a little kids book.      Most public libraries also have it where you can rent movies. Libraries are gona have movies that are rated '@CAPS1' and '@NUM1' because if they didn't they wouldnt have much success in rental of movies. All they would have is little kid movies an what teenager or adult between @NUM2 and @NUM3 would want to watch a little kid movie. I don't think any of them would want to watch any of that. They need action movies and other movies like that with alot of violence and stuff in it.        Reading is what shapes this world. Eveybody reads books everyonce in awhile. Most adults read books on weekened nights when they don't have anything planned. Teenagers have to read surtain books in school that are assigned by teachers in english class.      Parents need to learn that they cannot control what is in types of movies and books are in the library, only the state and the library can control that. They have these books in their for a reason. Every book has a reason to stay in the library to"	7504	7505
5242	2	"A library should not have to censor their books. If parents decide that they do not want their child accidentally picking up a book with offensive material, then they are responsible for either going with the child to pick one out themselves or buying their own books for their children to read. It should not have to be the library's responsibility to make sure children are reading suitable material. After all, the parent is the one allowing the child to go to the library without supervision.     Next, there are many other places in addition to the library for children to hear or see offensive material. For example, most children probably watch television at home with their parents, but what parent wants to watch cartoons and 'iCarly' all night? The answer is not many. Another thing to think about is cell phones. It seems as if every eight-year-old now has a cell phone, and if that cell phone has internet access, the possibilities of what a child could find there are endless. Video games are yet another place where children might be exposed to violence or otherwise offensive content. The media is to blame, not libraries.     Also, every child goes to school, and some of the learning done at school is not taught by a teacher. Other children have a huge effect on what a child will see, hear, and learn. It is impossible to prevent. For example, when I was a little girl, I was allowed to go to a friend's house, and I remember watching a movie that my parents would not approve of, and my parents never knew.     In addition, preventative  measures have been taken at libraries to keep chidren from finding these forbidden readings. Special rooms are made for different age groups in order to keep teenagers from influencing the younger children. Also, it might help if a librarian was available to make sure younger children do not read or check out unsuitable movies, @CAPS1's, magazines, or books.     Finally, if libraries are going to be censored, then everything else would have to be. It is not fair to punish community libraries for the good of a few kids. Children are going to discover things on their own, and parents have to learn to let them."	7506	7507
5243	2	"I think it depends on what they are censoring. Words that can be considered racist and offensive or are just inappropriate for kids shouldnt be displayed. Movies with gore should only be able tot be taken out as long as the parent is with them. I come from @LOCATION2, and there nudity is perfectly ok and I think it should be ok here too. Its just the human body, people shouldn't be afraid of it or have to censor it. So I believe nudity shouldn't be censored.     In my opinion, some things should be censored and others shouldn't. Curse words should still be censored for kids because I believe its not right to teach kids at a young age foul language. Racist words should be too so there isn't any racist drama or so the company doesn't get sued. Movies with gore and horror should be only available to kids as long as the parent is ok with them watching it. Books shouldn't be censored unless they are made for adults only. Books are all about imagination, so a book could only be as graphic as the kid pictures in their head. If the kid doesn't like whats in the book then he can stop reading it. Casual nudity shouldn't be censored. I grew up around nudity in @LOCATION2 and it doesn't bother me one bit. In every country, besides The @LOCATION1, is ok with nudity since it just the human body. Why they freak out over it so much, I have no idea but 'exccesive' nudity I don't think should be displayed to youger kids. I think they should reach an age limit, like @NUM1, before seeing anything like that. Music should be like my opinion for horror movies. If parents dont want them listening to some rapper talk about how he's shooting people and doing drugs or a band that worships the devil. I'm perfectly fine with that. I'd hate for my kids to listen to anything like that. They should keep the rating on everything still just in case some parents aren't ok with it.     In conclusion, everyone has their own opinion. I'm sure many people would disagree with mine but that's how I see it. Some of the things they have censored here, in my opinion, shouldn't. While others should remain censored for the youth or faint hearted. Libraries are public places and it depends on what they public is and is not ok with. Libraries normally don't have much that should be kept from the youth or have anything that's really offensive so most of this most people shouldn't even worry about."	7508	7509
5244	2	"What kind of books are the children of our world reading now and days? Are the books they get ahold of age appropriate or the movie that they go and watch really what they think it is? Parents, teachers, and just regular citezens all over the world are asking themselves these questions almost everyday whenever they see their child reading a book with the front cover of a girl and a guy kissing or whenever their child is watching a movie thats pretty graphic. The next thing that needs to be asked is why, why are children at certain ages aloud to pick out this book or movie from a library and be able to take it home with them and watch and almost scar their lives forever from watching one simple movie or reading a book. Books and movies need to be reviewed so parents, teachers, and citezens don't half to ask why?      When you go to a library you expect to find different sections for different age groups of kids. Well sometimes if the kids are sent to the library alone they don't follow the guidelines of where they are suppose to be getting their books from. That's exactly when children of such young ages pick up book, movies, magazines, etc. that they shouldn't be picking out. Their needs to have be certain age requirements on different books because to many kids now and days are learning and hearing about different things that they shouldn't be hearing about. Either a parent needs to go with the child when they go to the library or the person who checks the book outta the library needs to check the book. If people can't even check what kind of book they are giving to a little child then they need to be taken out of the library. Those kinds of books and movies that are being given to little kids need to be banded from the library or put in a special place where young children can't get ahold of them. Books, movies, magazines, etc. need to be reviewed before putting them on the shelf, especially if it is going to be in the reach of a little kid. Even though the cover might look age appropriate doesn't mean the words on the inside are.     I can remember myself one evening, my little cousin was over at my house and we were just talking. I had made the mistake myself about having a show on tv that wasn't appropriate for her age. My little cousin started to talk to me about things that I myself that was bad to just randomly blurt out and talk about. My little @NUM1 year old cousin was talking to me about sex. I had to ask her where she was hearing or even learning this kind of information from. She flat out told me that she had read a book from the library at school that was talking about all that kind of stuff. I was appalled to hear that even at a school library there were books that consisted of talking about things that adults should be talking about. Books like that should be taken out of school libraries for good and be put in a more responsible place. I understand, yes that having books like that in a public library in a top shelved area where a little kid couldn't reach it or maybe a high school library is ok because kids at that age understand what that kind of stuff is, but when it becomes a time when a elementary school kid talks to you about that either from reading a book or watching a movie from a library that's when it needs to be taken care of!     So yes, I agree @PERCENT1 that if the person putting the book on the shelf isn't going to take the time of day to overlook the book or watch the simplest movie before they put it out for the public to be exposed to, then the book shouldn't go on the shelf at all! You never know what will be on the inside of those books. Kids don't deserve to half to sit there and read or watch a movie over things that they don't need to know about. Even myself as a teenager find things like that offensive to see in a magazine or movie, never the less a @NUM1 year old in elementary school that still has a life to live. I might be @NUM3 years older that my @NUM1 year old cousin, but i still believe that items that include offensive behaviors or fowl language should not be available! I feel that everyday I can walk down the hallways and just hear people talking about what they watched or read and most of the time it includes offensive things.     So in conclusion, I believe that items that are marked as offensive to anybody should be taken off the shelves and put into storage away from the world. Even if that one book or movie is to be told a number one hit, it needs to be taken off the shelves to save little kids and even teens from having to deal or hear about those items. Take it off the shelf or don't put it up at all!"	7510	7511
5245	2	"Many forms of literature is found to be offensive, especially adults' sections that are provided only for their entertainment. But sometimes children sway from their shelves, that are censored for their well-being, and to an inappropriate section. I believe that these certain books should not be provided in a public library where children go with their parents.     I know how curious children are, especially at my sister's age. She is only nine-years-old, but she is slowly making her way to being a young adolecent and has strayed into adult territory in the library many times. Most of these books have inappropriate language, scenes of 'love-making', and violence. Of course people say that children at her age are supposed to learn these aspects of life on their own, but why should she accidentally read a book that has these certain aspects and then consider it okay? The libraries should be censored. If an adult wants a certain book like that then they should buy it for themselves and hide it away from pure minds. However, if an individual cannot afford to buy their books for themselves then either a library for adults should be made, or special sections in libraries could be fenced off that only adults can enter.     Even magazines, I think, should be censored. Most magazines are not based on a child's mind. They are made for gossip and are more suitable for an adult's mind-set. Especially the ones about celebrity relationships, drama, drugs, and alcohol. We should be trying to teach our children not subject them to ideas of corruption that society thrusts upon them.     Society can be cruel to whoever is thrown out into it. That is why we prepare our children: to be ready to go out on their own. However, from these books they learn too early. Even if it's accidental or not the books and/or magazines can corrupt an innocent mind and influence our generation. We need to censor our libraries for this reason and make sure the children's minds match their age and keep them from being influenced by society."	7512	7513
5246	2	"I believe that certain books should be where the libraries can actually have control of the books magazines music and movies to teenage adults @NUM1 and up. I disagree by them trying to remove the items from the libraiers. I'll just make sure that whom, ever trying to purchase the item should have picture id stating that the adult is @NUM1.                    Students should be able to go look for there items that they are searching for freely. They need to be good readers and like exploring other activies like movies and magazines. Adults should'nt be punish for the mistake that other people are making by creating these offesive things. I agree that children should'nt be able to read it. There still growing up and should be exploring diffrent things instead of negativity.               As a parent students should not be able to do certain things. Like goes in the library and purchase offensive books and other materials with out a parent or gaurdiant with them. Parents should be more strict on there kids by what they do or watch other children do cause if they groqw up watching everyone do wrong by them. Thats what they go think they can do. Students should take there education serious.               Me being a young mother my mother made sure that i had everything i wanted. She made sure i did the right thing because you have to learn your lessons. And student should grow up knowing what's right and wrong. If you think a book is not right for your child or a movie take it away and then tell your child why you think this is not right for him or her. I just believe thats the right thing to do. Then when your child grows up to be an adult then they will know what to tell there children right from wrong.                         Just be aware that there are some places that will let your child purchase things that he or she is not suppose to. I just will check over your child daily and see what they are reading for they want grow up thinking they can read things that aint bout the right for them. But I also think that they will know better. I just know that children are diffrent now days and they might like reading offensive things."	7514	7515
5247	2	"Censorship in the @LOCATION1 libraries is a largely discussed topic amongst its citizens. Some of these citizens are against censorship and stand strongly next to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS3. Then there are others that believe in 'protecting the young minds of @LOCATION2 from flthy literature.' @CAPS4 analyzing @CAPS5 arguement, the obvious and correct answer would be to agree with the citizens that are against censorship.     Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And the we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 quote from Paterson alludes to the fact that if literature begins to be censored, then literature and works of art will cease to exist. Paterson could not be any more correct in her inference. The strong stance that many citizens of the @LOCATION3 take next to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must remain @CAPS5 way or literature will vanish. As all of the @LOCATION3 citizens know, even the ones that agree with censorship, that literature is to valuable to children and to everybody for it to just be thrown away. The works of art from around the world should be used to open people's minds, and not be used for kindling in a fire. Therefore the citizens that protect the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must remain in doing so or the life of the valuable literature will be dead forever in the @LOCATION3     @CAPS10 these citizens that are against censorship and protect the works of art, these citizens must allow some censorship in @LOCATION3 libraries. @CAPS5 is because libraries must be able to understand where to draw the line for some literature. '@CAPS11' magazine can be used as an example. @CAPS5 magazine, as all should know, should not be allowed in children's schools. Like @CAPS5 magazine and many other literature texts and pornagraphic movies, libraries should be selective on what to allow and what not to allow on the shelves. Even though there is a large argument on @CAPS5 topic between two groups, the groups would mostly likely agree to censoring @CAPS5 type of literature from the school.      The citizens that protect the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS3 are correct to stand up for what is right to do in @CAPS5 situation. People, mainly children, should be allowed to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to in libraries, with some exceptions. These exceptions that have to do with how 'adult' movies and books that should not be allowed in libraries. @CAPS10 with @CAPS5 exception, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS3 should not be spit on by the @CAPS17 people and should not allow censorship in @LOCATION3 libraries. Without the protection of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, people would be robbed of observing works of art from around the world. Therefore the view that is against censorship is correct in the argument of whether to allow censorship or not in the @LOCATION1"	7516	7517
5248	2	"Do you want your kid in jail? I dont think anyone does, but the message of music, movies, magazines let young kids and teenagers, believe it is funny, or cool. That can be mislead, and what if your child thinks it is cool to do what the type of music he is listening to.     The message these days, have nothing to do with the product they are selling. Kids today see offensive magazines, movies, and listen to offensive music. Just think, an @NUM1 year old boy, maybe he is your son, neighbor, or nephew listening to and reading offensive things, and you might not want him learning or seeing these things. They can read about famous people being arrested, and that person could be there idle, they might just do what they did because they look up to them.     I think all the offensive things needs to be taken out, that is why a lot of people are in jail, because of these things. So i say no one should go to jail if they dont have a reason to, that is why all the offensive things need to go."	7518	7519
5249	2	"No, I do not believe that some books, music, and magizines should be removed because one person thought it was offensive. Like Katherine Paterson said, if everyone had the right to remove a book that they didn't like or thought was offensive, we would end up with having no or very little books in a library.      Anyone can say they find a book, a type of music, or a certain magizine offensive. The problem is, is what do they find offensive about it? Is it to vulgar? Inappropriate for small children to find? Or do they believe it contains racial slurs, or anything putting down a certain race? Either way, if someone thought a certain item should be removed they probably should have a really good reason for it to be taken or removed from the library.      Taking away certain items or books is a really hard thing to do probably if you really think about it. Some people @MONTH1 be offended if another person that didn't like the subject of it just  took away that book talked about a certain country, heritage, or anything that might of tied the people to history in time. Maybe even children stories that have been passed down and told through out time might offend people if they were taken from the library. How would parents tell their children wonderful fairy tales or exciting adventures that characters experienced if they where taken out? The stories would be lost though time and no one would never know what was the right story or not.      Also, with the music, some people @MONTH1 not like what others listen to, but that doesn't mean that they have to remove that certain type of music from a place. If a certain person doesn't like rap, then don't go to the rap section and start going through every artist and song trying to figure out which one you dont like the most. That's just ridiculous and uncalled for. Let's say a person likes country music but not metal. Would the person that likes country music like it if another person who hates country but loves metal comes to the library and remove every single country song, album, and artist from the library? No, I think not.      All together it would probably start tons of fueds on what people have and/or are removing from libraries.  Everyone would fight for what they like and try to keep it placed there in the library. So said in my previous statement in the first paragraph, I believe that no one should be allowed to remove a certain item from a library"	7520	7521
5250	2	"I don't think that the certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.The reason  that we had a library at school is they want all of us to learn more things from the book ,magzines and so forth.But if one of us have taken book off the shelf,then the other people will think : if somebody else can do that ,why I can't?As a result ,it will form a vicious circle that every one think it's okay to remove the book from the shelf .And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us .                                                               I like spend my time at library after school,everybody is reading ,doing homework and being quiet.It is a great place to enjoy your favorite book in a neat learning atmosphere. It was @DATE1 @TIME1,the temperature still hiting sixty.I decided that stay after in the library probably would be a good idea.I heard from my friends that the 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a great book,she even cried when she read it.And she told me that she read that book at library recently.I used almost an hour to find that book,and I found nothing. I guess it's somebody rent it or it just disappeared.when I look back in a corner,there was a book lay on the floor without cover.I picked it up and put on the top of the shelf. I don't know what that book is.But I believe that somebody else probably is finding this book just like me.                                                                                     I think a lot of people who like go to library had the same or similar experience as me.It was very disappinting when you can't find your favorite book ,magzine or movies at a certain place.library is a public place where we can get information from the book ,or enjoying music.In order to creat a good reading habit .We need to learn how to share with other people.If all of us follwing the rule in the library.It will make all of us happy"	7522	7523
5251	2	"The censorship of materials in public places should not be happening. The idea of it @MONTH1 seem decent, however it can easily be taken too far. The @CAPS1 gives @CAPS2 the ability to have access to whatever they want. This means that in publicly owned places such as libraries, the people should be able to see all things that are in the library. Though to some people, some documents @MONTH1 seem to be unreasonable, and too bad for other people to see, it is not their choice. America is known across the world for the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and should also be freedom to see.      The censorship of reading options in schools has been taken too far. It is clear that certain books are meant for adults, however this has been pushed to the limit. In schools, books like @ORGANIZATION1 have been removed due to people thinking that it encourages magic. Taking the books away, is taking their rights away. Is is so bad that there is now a @CAPS3 Book @CAPS4, which encourages schools that have not @CAPS3 certain books to promote the ones that have been in other schools. The fact that censorship has been taken so far that some schools are not allowed to read books other children are, is outrageous. What children read should be up to their parents, not to their principals.      Libraries are not the only place where controversial things  are found. If people really want to see something, they could go and find it elsewhere, like the internet. The internet has all of the same things that could be found in public areas and worse. The internet has the ability for a person to search and find just about anything and everything a person could think of. The internet has not been censored, so why should our public places? If it can be encountered it on the internet, it is reasonable that they should have it in public areas as well.      Though the materials should not be removed, it is resonable for them to be put into sections according to their audience. Having the books organized with similar ones is completely reasonable, and a way to censor the books, without removing them. To incorporate a 'science fiction' area and an 'adult' area, are great ways to warn the people of what could easily be included in the section. People would quickly learn to go only in the areas they want, and avoid all areas they do not want to see. Another options is something similar to what is done for movies. Rating things by their content, and using a warning sign would also work for books. It would explain to the reader exactly what they were going to get. This puts the decision upon the individual if what they are reading is okay for them, not to the people surrounding them.     @CAPS2 have twisted their ideas of their rights in the constisution so much that they attempt to dictate what other @CAPS2 can and cannot do. This attempt is completely the opposite of what the @CAPS1 is telling them. People have the rights to censor themselves, but not others. If they do not want to see a reading material, it follows they should choose to stay away from it, not take it from other people. It is lawful for the things to be arranged in such a manner that it is an option to avoid, however it is still accessable to others. Taking books away from people who want to read them is not only un-american, it is unconstitutional, and wrong."	7524	7525
5252	2	"Yes, because I think some people would find it offensive, but I also think it is stuff going on in our lives that people need to know about. I feel that magazines is stuff that happens everyday in life so I think they should stay in libraries. I think some books would be okay but it really just matters what they are about. I think music is a way of expressing yourself and I think that should stay. I think that movies should be taken off, because some could be offensive to people that watch them.     Censorship is a big part of life. people don't like some of it but they have to deal with it. I understand that some people find stuff offensive.The way I look at it is dont read it or watch it. I know that sounds kind of mean but it's something we all have to live through. I think that bad books and movies should be taken off the shelves because of kids and some adults that arn't mature. I also think that books and movies about rape shouldn't be aloud to be anywhere because that is just wrong and not right for someone to have that. I think that is a big part that people might find offensive because of something maybe that happened in their lives or a family or friends life.     I'm not saying libraries are bad because they help me with research and with school work but I just wish they would choose their books and movies wisely. I don't understand why they would have books about shooting, violence, drugs, and etc. I think that bad stuff like that should be in a library where only adults can go and not children. I think that because all that bad stuff could put thoughts into a young childs mind and that could lead to someone getting hurt or killed"	7526	7527
5253	2	"Censorship in public libraries should not be allowed.  Every person has something that he finds offensive that others @MONTH1 not.  Giving people the freedom to take opportunities away from other people should not be an option.  Letting censorship be allowed in public libraries is similar to taking the rights away from citizens at public libraries, therefore, taking away the principles on why the public library was founded in the first place.      The public library acts as an opportunity for all classes of people to get information via movie, book, computer, or any other storer of information.  If certain books, movies, computers, etc... are not stored at the library due to censorship, how is the 'average @PERSON1' supposed to pick up that information?  The only other option in this case would be to buy it, however, if we let censorship allowed in all public libraries what will be next?  Will it go to far?  Will online databases, bookstores, movie theaters, and internet shopping sites be censored as well?       There are many award winning war movies out in the world today that tell the story of that particular war better than any person @MONTH1 be able to do.  Not only is 'a picture worth a thousand words,' but also if we let libraries become censored (the storer of the majority of information in the world) and becomes a domino effect with other informational sources, how are teachers going to be able to teach what has happened in our history?  The terrorist attack on @NUM1 was a horrifying event to watch on @CAPS1.  There were people jumping out of windows while there offices and structure which they were just standing on was being burned to the ground.  This obviously wouldn't pass the 'censorship' that some want offered in libraries.  How can @CAPS2's warn the next generations about the dangers of @CAPS3 extremists if there is no libraries to back up this information?  Will it be lost overtime?       The censorship in libraries in an obserd idea, and should not even have the option to be considered.  There are too many great works in the world to just throw away due to censorship, as well as a great deal of dangers in the world that need to be passed on, and without these works and movies being stored in libraries there is no easy way to get ahold of them.  The domino effect happens quite often throughout history, for example the rise and fall of communism, and letting the libraries be censored will result in all the other storers of information being censored, and that is just not parallel to the rights of the @CAPS2 citizen"	7528	7529
5254	2	"Through out history there have been events that questoned the integerity of many great works. From large book burnings in the middle adges, to protests in more modern times, people have been concerned about the effect that some literature has on humanity.     The libraries should by no means censor their collections. Many of the greatest works of literature have contreversal supject matter. If these books wwere kept from the public then the knoweadge lock withen is lost.      If parents are concered for the effect this has on their children they should limit what is read by them, not limiting the general population to the meterials. If the meterial is unsuitable for children then they should be kept away, but this meterial is acepteble for whom it is made for.          However there is certain media needed to be censored, for example we cant have @CAPS1 smoking pot of having sex.For this reason media that is enteneded for children should be suitiable for them.      The question on cesorship is one that troubles our modern lifestile. This can be simpily answered is an unsimple way; depending on the subject matter, the terms, the setting, and the adeance media should be cendored withen reason."	7530	7531
5255	2	"Books, Magazines, and Music that is offensive          @CAPS1, I think they should be taken off of the shelf, because some people @MONTH1 find it very offensive. If I saw a book or magazine that was offensive I would probably go and tell the people at the front counter of the store that it was offensive to me. I myself havew never seen something offensive to me but I think it @MONTH1 have been offensive to others.        By taking these books off the shelves it would change a whole lot. There would be no more complaints. Which is a good thing because you dont want you store to have a bad reputation for inappropriate or offensive things on your shelves. You dont want little kids coming in there and seeing all that stuff anyway. So, it would just be best to take it down or off the shelves.      So, when somebody complains ir asks you to take it down you should proabaly do it. If your gonna have that stuff then have a different sectio for it that only people of age can go into. Like I said i have not once been offended by it but i think some people @MONTH1 have been just not myself and no matter what it has to do with someone somewhere can always be offended by it because of religion or parents or other reasons"	7532	7533
5256	2	"I just got done reading The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2. Where a young boy escapes with a slave to get to freedom down the @LOCATION1. Now this book has been banned a lot in the years mainly because of it's use of the 'n-word' to refer to the slaves. Most people would think that it is racist to call a slave that, but I think it captures the time of the novel as being in the @DATE1's right before the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, when during the time there was debates about slavery. If they wont read this book because of the fact it uses the n-word, then a censored version should be made changing the n-word to slave because its a great book that everyone should read. Still most @CAPS4 ban the book just because of that one word.         Many @CAPS4 have banned books for being offensive to some people but I dont think they should be taken off the shelves. If you come across a book that your reading and you find it offensive. Take it to the libarian and you should state the reason the book is offenisve and the libariry should decide whether or not to remove it from the shelves. Instead of removing it the book should get a little label describing why it is bad so then when your looking for a book you can know whether or not the book has any offensive words or themes. The books could also get a censored version made, so that if you want to read the book there are two copies there to choose from the censored and the uncensored versions.   Most people dont know what they are missing when they see a book on a banned list and do not read it. Some of the greatest stories are on the banned list. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 should all have a part of the store that shows banned books so people that want to read them can and people that dont want to read them know where they are at so they can steer clear of that area. Is it not a constitutional right to have the freedom of speech? Does that mean taking books off the shelves is breaking that constitutional right?"	7534	7535
5257	2	"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1,     I wish to address the fact of the censorship of materials of your library. I feel some of the censorship is very well needed and then I feel that other times the censorship is not needed. There are many factors that I consider when I identify a piece of material as appropriate or inapppropriate.      My first example is when I see material that @MONTH1 contain violence or hatrid towards a race or a certian group of individuals. When I see this, I consider this book appropriate when this material would just explain why there was this hostility toward a certian group.      I would also consider this book appropriate if, for example, a book was written about  the life of an @CAPS2 @CAPS3 during slavery. If the book is written to explain the life of someone who was a slave and it explained how it truly was during that time and how there were hardships, this book would  be appropriate to me. If the book contains something such as racist terms, I would consider this ok only because this was what it was like during this time. As long as it was implying how the people were mean and evil to these people.     Another example could be a movie that shows many killings  of an race, culture, or religion that is a true story. If the suituation happened in real life, I would find it ok because it explains a true event. In my mind, the event must also support why this killing was wrong and how it was out of line.        Inappropriate material can be easy or very hard to spot. For example, If the library contains a magazine that promotes something harmful to someone are implies hostility towards some group or individual in any way, I think it should be banned. An example could be a @CAPS4 flag on a magazine that had no relation to history whatsoever. This would be appropriate if they were talking about the @CAPS5 @CAPS6, but in this case it is a sign of hostility toward a group of individuals. Someone who is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @MONTH1 find this offensive and question if the library supported a certian race of people.      More innappropriate  material in my mind would be something that favors a certian political @ORGANIZATION2 and that tries to diminsh another @ORGANIZATION2 or a celibrity magazine. This material should not be in a library because no group or individuals should be put down for their beliefs. An example would be someone who would read a book @CAPS9 the @ORGANIZATION1. Let's say this book contains material that talking down on the @ORGANIZATION2. If a @CAPS10 saw this he or she @MONTH1 question if  the library holds hostility towards @CAPS11.      Relating to my movie example in the fourth paragraph, I have a reason to bring up a case for more inappropriate material. Some movies are not appropriate for a library or for a library or anywhere else in my opinion. An example of this could be a movie that wasn't true that showed a man who had to work with a group of @CAPS12 somewhere. Say the @CAPS12 tried to assure that their belief was right and his wasn't. Then the man would decide assemble a group of people to kill a group of people that were @CAPS14. This movie would not be approriate at all because of the message it sends. This movie would send a message to some to show hostility towards a race or a religion, and in a way, encourage them to eliminate these people.      This is the way I feel on the suituation and I would hope that my concerns about this will not go unnoticed. I hope this letter is taken into consideration.                                                            Sincerely,                                                       @ORGANIZATION3"	7536	7537

Some @MONTH1 say that not all the materials are appropriate for others. Remember the library is a place for everyone, so with viewing comes resposibilty and judgement. What one @MONTH1 find offensive , another @MONTH1 find delightful. This is a diverse world full of many different people, theres no saying what would be considered offensive or not.      Removing certain materials from the shelfs has very little signifigance, simply, if you don't like it-don't look at it. For parents or anyone who is concerned about children or young ones coming across material that @MONTH1 be harmful to them, simply view or suggest positive books or material that would interest them, or just stay by their side and guide them to appropriate material and away from the bad.     Truly if one comes across something they find offensive, thats their own fault. You control what you view and do, so blaming the library is not a reasonable option.

Books aren'@CAPS1 the only thing that have been banned for inappropriate content either. Many songs are banned from being played on the radio because they have underlying themes and ideas that many people say is offensive.

You shouldn'@CAPS1 ban or even censor things just for swearing. All you have to do is monitor who is listening to it or reading it.

5260	2	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     'To each your own.' @CAPS1 is a quote I try to live by. We all have our own opinions, personalities, likes, and dislikes; most of the time, I believe, it is in one's best interest to agree to disagree with an oposing idea.      There are an abundence of books that I can think of that can be taken as controversial pieces. One in particular is The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. In @CAPS1 book a country girl is arranged to marry a man who beats her, in reality she is lesbian. In parts of the books she is called offensive names, but in the end she is able to overcome indifference and be happy with someone she loves. To someone who is against same sex marriage, exspecially when @CAPS1 book came out, @CAPS1 happy ending @MONTH1 be an outrage. They @MONTH1 think that the book should indeed be taken off the shelf. I do not think it would be fair to abanish a book like @CAPS1 because certain people dissagree with the story plot. I also believe that a book like @CAPS1 can be benifical to those who need support dealing with simular situations.      Just @DATE1, a group of people were trying to get rid of the word nigger in one of our books we were reading in class about slavery. I can see how @CAPS1 could easily offend someone of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 race, but I also think that the book was just trying to help the narrator sound realistic. Using @CAPS1 word also provided historical background and helped us understand how harsh many @CAPS4 @CAPS7 had it in that time period.      Books are a good way to excape from our own lives into a new time period or a new setting. Books can teach you about different races, ethnic groups, political ideas, or social structures. As Katherine Paterson stated, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone should get the freedom to read any book they please. You are free to chose to dislike a book and never read it again; in my opinion,  that is as good as abanishing a book"	7542	7543
5261	2	"In libraries across the world their are problems with censorship. Their are even problems with censorship in our very own @ORGANIZATION1 at school, but do we see these problems? People think censorship is just another word people use on a daily basis, but it really means so much more. Is it an issue or is it something we can just look over? Should we fix this problem or should we let it on by?     Censorship is definitly not something we can just look over. It is something we have to think and act upon. If  we just let people control what is in libraries will we ever get a taste of the real world? Will we ever know the issues and consequences of our own actions? Alot of people make fun of other people because of their race or their hair color, but can we fix this?     If we take all of the books out of the libraries that are offensive to people, they wont read about what their actions can do to people. They will think that its really not even a problem. If you want children to learn about the real world, young or old, then you have to let them live it not hold them back when something they see or read is something horrible. Children are like little adults, they dont want to see some of the bad things going wrong in the world but sometimes they have to, to understand whats really happening.      When i was about @NUM1 years old, my mom took me to the @ORGANIZATION1. Iv never been their before and it was like getting ice cream on a hot summers day. It was fun, relaxing, and very mind refreshing. Mother said she use to love going into libraries as a child, going through books like they were a new toy, except that isn't how i expierienced my first trip to the @ORGANIZATION1. This little girl who was about my age got a book off the book shelf, it wasn't the 'type' of book @CAPS2 mother wanted @CAPS2 reading, but she read it anyways. When they went to check out the little girl asked the employee, '@CAPS1 is their so many books about black people, they are just like us aren't they?' @CAPS2 mother turned @CAPS2 around and slapped @CAPS2 so hard that I was suprised she wasn't knocked out. That is censorship, the everyday problem that we all have to face but do we really listen to these problems?      Censorship is a problem but should we remove everything that is offensive to us and others? No, just because it is offensive doesn't mean we should remove it. Their will be alot of problems and people who think we should but that is their opinion and everyone has a right to an opinion. Use your voice, speak your opinion because people want to hear you. If you dont speak out then someone out their @MONTH1 be affected because of your actions. Censorship is a problem  but all you can do is use your voice, it @MONTH1 even be the most powerful tool, but you will never know until you reach out to people and use this tool."	7544	7545
5262	2	Well i belive that if you thinl music movie magazines should be hide or be hind the conter like sex ed book or book about std s cuz we all know that lil kids should not be read about.                       Std at the age of five the should not be walkin and go to a shelf and pick up a book about that thats one reson .       The next reson why is there should not be xxx magazines in a place of respect like out at your house so kids can just go pick @CAPS1 of a shelf man and if you have a home with a book shelf       You should have coloring book and bed time books so your kids can read thoes thing and if you have the other types of book you should have      @CAPS1 in your room were your kids can not get to @CAPS1 and that how you deal with that .  Also if you kid gets a whole to @CAPS1 you should set him down and talk to your son our you lil girl.   About what he did that ever book is not mad for little kids to read and tell him that there are books for little and older kis to and adults	7546	7547
5263	2	"Do I believe having books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if they are offensive? No I do no think they should be removed. The people have the right to see the material if they are offensive. Maybe they like seeing the offensive material.     The reason why I think they shouldn't remove the offensive material from the shelves is because people @MONTH1 find the offensive material that fascinating to read or watch. If the offensive material concludes historical violence or animal violence, then I think people should have the right to see it if it involves learning and helping that person to better understand the material. If we remove most of the offensive material then we would not have a lot of books, music, movies, and or magazines left on the shelfs.      Not a lot of people @MONTH1 find the offensive material so offensive but interesting and would maybe like to find out more about that material. You just can't take it away off the shelfs, a book if has some bad language in it, by my have one person who found it offensive to have bad language in it.      So my conclusion about offensive material being taken off the shelfs by some people who found it offensive is nonsence and they should not do that if more people find it interesting than others. It's a good learning experience for people but for a small portion of those would not get that learning experience but find it emusing have that type of material on the shelfs and think they need to take it off for others who don't like it as well. There might be one part of the movie or book that has a little part that can be offensive but the rest is fine. Don't ruin it for others who @MONTH1 like the offensive material and find it intersting. I say keep it on the shelfs!"	7548	7549
5264	2	"I believe inappropriate movies,books,music and magazines should be in another section or placed where older people who would like it go too that section. So people that know what they are looking for would go to the right section.      I believe there should be certain sections that are appropriate for all age groups.  In the children section there should be kids books, music, movies, magazines, etc.that are age appropriate.    In the teen section there should be books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that are only appropriate for teens. Teens would not have the same interest as younger children.     All books, movies, magazines, etc. should remain in the library but in certain sections that are age appropriate."	7550	7551
5265	2	"Dear @CAPS1,      In my opinion, I believe that the libraries have no right to ban offensive movies, music, magazines, and books from the people who want to read them. If the viewer does not want to read or listen to the offenisve books or music that is exposed to the public, then viewer should not pick the offensive material up.These offensive materials have a great impact on the public. Adults @MONTH1 not want their children to pick up these uncensored materials, but that does not mean that the materials should be taken off the shelves because it is offensive to some individuals.     The certain parents who think the libraries should remove these bad materials from their shelves should keep a better eye on their children and watch what they pick up. Libraries have a children's zone where children have their books, music, and magazines that do not have inappropriate material in them.      Children might pick up these bad materials out of bad habit. If you tell your children not to watch something then they should not watch it. If you tell your children not to read something then your children should not read it. No matter what your children are going to be exposed to these certain materials later on in life.      These offensive materials are published for a reason and its to educate the younger generations out there of what has happened in the past. For example, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and the two @CAPS5 @CAPS6. These books have great meaning behind them. The books are published so that people will not forget that past.      I understand that some of these materials are very offensive to some of the public, but i believe that these materials should be left on the shelves. These materials are a great use to the majority of the public and these materials will be of great use to children some day"	7552	7553
5266	2	"Honestly in my opinion I don't think that anything offensive should be removed from shelves because some people like to watch or read offensive things because its either funny or they just want see people get hurt or see people get mad. Even if people don't like seeing violence or anything else that offends them at least put them in a area were they are separated from non-offensive books, etc. I also think that if they were to still try remove them then at least seperate them to were you have to be @NUM1 to go into the offensive section or whatever they feel like calling it.      Taking away offensive type genres from some teens and adults would be like taking kid stories too. It's all just a matter of opinion of what people like or how they was raised to like certain different genres of books, magazines, movies etc. Just like @PERSON1 said if you have the same right to remove a book off a shelf then so do I and so does every other person on this planet that don't like something you like. Therefore there are no more books left on the shelf for any of us, so if you take that genre of censorship then mine as well take all of them.     One thing that has happened to me before that was similar was how there was this game I wanted when I was little, it was an offensive game but it was really good and I thought it was pretty funny. It was called blitz the league and they took it off the shelves because it had to many swear words in it, and it showed alot of violence and breaking of bones in it. But overall it was a really fun game and it was good."	7554	7555
5267	2	"Libraries are an important source of knowledge in a community.  This is because every library has different books to share with the public.  Different books, vast knowledge, and never ending learning.  @CAPS1 are the qualities that a library should posses.  Although not all books are meant for all ages snd that is why libraries need to seperate books carefully.     Libraries across the world are incredibly organized, but the real question is: are they organized in the right way?  No matter how much a parent tries to forget, they still worry about their child finding a book they don't want them to read.  Libraries need more diversity in their organization system.  This means they need to seperate books through the range of age.  Some libraries have this system already but they need to make their rules clear so no one under aged gets into the section for older people.     Just as Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 words are something that every library should follow.  Libraries have a responsibility that they need to carry out and that is to deliver people knowledge and entertainment through books.  Although, over the years libraries have carried more than books over the years such as music, movies, magizines, and some have a computer center.  All of @CAPS1 things make the system even more complex and harder to maintain.       I remember when I was younger and I couldn't wait to go to the library.  The library that I grew up with is very organized and well kept.  They had everything that was needed: the kids section, the young teenager, the young adult section, and everything else after the young adult section was put in the far left corner.  It was a relatively big library and very popular to the public.  They also had competitions, mostly reading competitions, in the @DATE1 for the kids.  I have learned plenty from this library and I still look forward to the day that I return.     The main thing that I have learned about libraries through the years is that organization is a key component to a successful library.  Every library has their own system, but it  still needs to work for the public.  The library in a community serves the public and thats how t should be."	7556	7557
5268	2	"There are alot of movies, magazines, movies, etc out there in the world. With todays society there are  bad/ offensive parts in them. Should these be taken off the self?          My name is @CAPS1. And @CAPS2 an @NUM1 grader still in high school. Personally, i dont understand why people get mad at this offensive/ bad stuff that is out there. There is alot of it, so people should just get over it. No matter who is incharge, or even who is the president, nobody will ever have the power/ability to remove every single offensive/ bad thing in the world. Its always going to be there.           I believe this stuff shouldn't be taken out of libraries. Even if someone tried, they will never get it all out. The person who is trying to remove this stuff because they are tired of hearing people complain, needs to realize even if they actually got everything out of the citizens hands, then they will still hear complaining. Ya, the first people complaining will be happy. But the first people complaining is not as bad as everybody else that is going to be mad that you took their stuff from them.                                                                                                         Isn't one of the admentments freedom of speech? If you took this stuff away, which most of it is about peoples beliefs, wouldnt you be taking away one of their rights? If you take away peoples rights, then your going to end up in trouble with the state anyway.           Think about it, nobody will ever be happy, so why not make the majority of the people happy by leaving the stuff their. If someone has a problem with something, they can just drop it and walk away. Its as easy as that.  I believe the offensive/bad stuff should be left alone. Its perfectly fine where its at"	7558	7559
5269	2	"There are many types of music, books, movies, and other materials that you can read about life, that could very well be taken offensive to many different people in many different ways. These materials are found everywhere; in stores, libraries, schools, and more. I personally don't think they should be removed at all, for several different reasons. It helps everyone learn about life, in different aspects, and it shows the real world and how people act to each other, and how they are treated. A lot of reading materials found in places such as libraries and any type of stores, can be discriminating and sometimes racial. An abundant amount of movies, books, and magazines show off drugs, alcohol, and other things. Even though it is wrong, it's how people feel and think, and what they do. They have a right to express their feelings and actions, and it is the real world, not everything and everyone is perfect, so why lie and try to make it seem perfect?     One reason why any of these items should not be removed because its the real world, and it's what really happens. When i watch movies, and listen to music that involve drugs and alcohol it makes me think. It makes a ton of people think. To me, seeing how some of these people live their lives in a negative way, it seems that nothing goes right for them and it teaches me to not make the not so smart decisions they have made, and to live a better life. There are a lot of songs and movies that talk about racial actions, guns, wars, gangs, drugs, alcohol, etc. and it makes me and the people around me to see how the real world is. I've seen movies about gangs, and gang violence, and it makes me think how some people have to live, they have to go through all of that. Some people think its offensive, but its real life. In some non-fictional movies and books, that stuff happens, and why should we pretend like it doesn't?     Having books that talk about race or anything that could offend someone should stay on the shelves because it could either be a factual book or someone expressing their feelings. If someone is expressing their feelings, and you take the time to sit down and read the book, and see their point of view, maybe that person reading the book could understand what has happened in that persons life or expierenced and it wouldn't be so offensive. If it is a factual book, then people need to take the time and read bout the facts, and try not to take it offensive.      I personally don't think that any movies, books, music, magazines and more should be taken off shelves of any store, library, or school. Reading, listening, and watching these things will to me, benefit people. They would because it allows people to learn about what is going on in the world, even though it @MONTH1 be offensive to a race. If they didn't have these things, the world would seem perfect to some people, and desastoris to other who live in a world with gang violence and other things like that. They would feel like no one else is like them, so it could be reassuring to some people that they aren't alone. Having these things around is a learning experience to me. It keeps me out of trouble, because I can see what i could get into. These materials should remain on the shelf, even if they could be offensive. People need to learn to look at it from a different view so it wont be. Everyone could learn a little more. So, with that being said, keep those materials on the shelf"	7560	7561
5270	2	"No i do not think that just because a book say some bad thingsit should be removed!Why cant many people just be reasonable and admit that destroying books like that is wrong,lets say I am a libraian and I love books of all sort but im not gonig to the it awayfor someone else not liking it for their personal iusses.How and why should many people do things like rate movies,magazines,music and books when its really up to the people.Lets face it many people in are world @MONTH1 have all the things they can buy but pay for are stuff or votes to make rated @CAPS1 aviable period!In oder to make these thing possable we must have a new world order but not for the goverment but ,us as the people.In time we will make this law for these products and wich there will be.This new earth that is to come will be of my father and his just like the @CAPS2 star.This I why I believe we should have many opsions and chouices."	7562	7563
5271	2	"Materials in libraries that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelves. The libraries should have no control on censorship with the books, movies, music, and magazines put on their shelves.      Some one worked hard making that book or magazine to put  on the shelf. They should get the right to have that book available for people to read or look at. Finding a book offensive is one's own opinion. Offensive, dirty, scandalous, these are all just opionated words. What one might find horrible and needs to be taken down, another might find it to be the best book he or she has ever read.      Some books are graphic for younger adults and maybe even some teenagers. Removing a book from the shelf completely is not okay. Librarians could maybe limit the age required to be able to check out the book if they want to help reduce the exposure of inappropriate material to young adults. Taking a book completely off a shelf so no one can read it, not even adults, I do not agree with that at all.      Some of the graphic material in books can be a real eye opener to some people, especially if that book is based on a true story. A non-fiction story about a young girl who has been raped, beaten, and drug around is guaranteed to have graphic material not suitable for young children in some mothers' eyes. That doesn't mean that the adults who can handle this kind of imagery and the kind of language used in the book should not be able to hear her story. Also, think of the character in the book. Do you think she would want people to hear her story? Of course she would!      Life is not always pretty. It can be down right ugly and disgraceful at times. A lot of the time it is more ugly and brutal than it is beautiful. Books are a way for people to see the ugly and to experience it to such a degree with the offensive materials that they will want to make a change. In my own personal experience, books have inspired me several times to make a difference and make a change, to help someone. I have read many books and magazines with offensive material that I would usually never discuss in front of anyone. I can honestly say, that these books were probably the ones that I will remember the most because they affected me so much.      Of course, these books can have bad effects on people, giving nightmares to some, and causing others to get red in the face whether from anger or embarrassment. More importantly, I believe these uncensored books show people what life is really like, with cruel and unusual punishment.     Again, if people don't like the graphic material or the offensive language and imagery in the libraries, then they won't check out that book. There are plenty of books in the library that are not offensive and tell happy stories. If that is what the people want to read, then it is the librarian's job to steer them away from the offensive books and lead them in the right direction.     For those readers that are not afraid of the reality of life and are ready to face it, they should be able to find books in the library that give them just that. If they want an eye opener, they should have the free will and right to go into their local library and find a book containing what they are looking for.     Libraries should not censor the material that comes into their building because it is not their opinions that decide what is too offensive for people to read. The author obviously didn't find it too graphic, and the author's intention for writing that book was so that the public could read it. That privilege of checking out the book you want should be left up to the public, offensive or not."	7564	7565
5272	2	"Yes, i would remove any music,books,magazines and any other ways of seeing materical that shouldn't be read or seen by childern or any other individual if has excrusating information in the content. One reason is because of some belifes other people might have for example if i see a book about worshiping the devil or something i'm not going to want my child even seeing that on a shelf in the kid section in the library.     Other examples such as reading a book based about the slavery some people might not want to see that because it brings back memories of there harsh past. Their not going to want to see pictures of there history and people being killed. Or maybe a @CAPS1 victim was watching the @NUM1 mintutes and they were interviewing another victim if i was in there situation i would change that channel because i'm not going to want to relive all that over just like the slavery. Just it's not right for some people to talk about something cause sometimes they don't even really know the whole truth.       By putting all this information together we get the conclusion of the passage being more of an opinion. But still people shouldn't put certain things out like that it does defend lots of people most of the time. So i say,we shouldn't put these type of things out but it's how other people also react to this quote."	7566	7567
5273	2	"Dale laznik      block @NUM1     @CAPS1 @NUM2         I think if someone thinks that a book is offensive they shouldent be in that paticular library. I belive that what is bad to one person isent so bad to someone else. I also think that all books and movies and evan magazines can open up a persons mind to ideas, thoughts and places they have never been.      If you don't like a library don't hold that library responsible for your veiw on the book its not the libraries fault. Being in @CAPS2 we have the freedom to look at whatever books we want to. I  think you can choose what you want to read.      Some people think some books are bad and other people think those books are amusing. If you find a book that doesn't look good to you don't let your children see it if that is the way you feel.      Some people live in a small town and never get the chance to see or experience other ways of life. Books and movies give them the chance to explore. If you took books and movies away, some people would be missing out on those experiences.      My opinion on cencership is that everyone has a right to there opinion. if you are not happy with your library then go to a different one. Everyone see's things in there own way. Don't deny people the right to learn about new things"	7568	7569
5274	2	"I do not believe that anyone has the right to censor certain materials from others. Every individual has their own idea on what they find offensive and not. To respect everyone's opinion, the censorship of material cannot happen without someone getting angry.     In @LOCATION1, each person has a right to their own ideas and opinions and to write whatever they want. As much as someone has a choice to write a book, someone else has the right to read it. When we let people censor our bookshelves, we give up our right to read whatever we want to.     What one person @MONTH1 find offensive, another person @MONTH1 not. Depending on different factors like how we were raised, when we were raised, and what kind of environment we live in, we all have different tastes and intrests, including liturature, music, and filmography. If you personally don't find a work good or you don't think it is appropriate for others then don't use it, don't promote it, and dont have it in your house or allow people living under your roof to use it. There are other steps you can take to showing your disapproval for a book other than to have it taken off shelves so others can't read it.     Some material are inappropriate. I'll admit that some movies should not be watched and some magazines make you cringe by even knowing they're out there. Some music is a bad influence as well as some book covers are plastered with sex symbols across the covers.      My brother and I recently got into an argument something like this. His favorite music is screamo and hard-core rock. I can't stand it. I dont understand how he enjoys it, and I don't like listening to it everyday when I come home from school. He, on the other hand, abhores country music, which is my preference to listen to. To him, country is the worst music ever made. I think his music should be taken away and banned, and he thinks mine should be banned. My mother doesn't like either types; she prefers classical. None of us should be able to take away eachother's type of music. We keep to ourselves and plug in our headphones.      Respect for another person doesn't just come from wanting what's best for them. It also comes from being open to their views and opinions on matters you might disagree on. You wouldn't want someone to tell you what you like is bad and that you can't listen to it anymore. The same goes if you tell someone else they're wrong for liking something. We all need to be tolerant to eachother's likes"	7570	7571
5275	2	"I feel that certian materials in libaraies should not be there but it ia a libary. it is suppost to carry vast things of information. there are somt thing i thing that should not be there because children go to the libary to look up thing aread and then while reading u see somthing in a book that is not apropit for the younger children to see.     Like some of the romatic novel that talk about sex and stuff likr that i think should now be in there but, if place in a diffrent part where only mature adilts go to then that is fine. Magizines in libaraies is on of the big problems beacusr there it a lot things in diffrent for smaller children not to see like diffrent celbiarites and body parts that should not be shown.     what i reall think that all libarabies should do is make diffrent parts of the libay and put age limits on the places you are allowed to gobut that is jus me.    Libraries i understand why you have all this things out the way you do but i dont really care about this censorship stuff this is america not a comunist country we have the freedom fo speech law and the right to expess ourselves the way we choose to be. So i say do what you want it really wont bother people all that much at least i dont think it will. because when i go to the library i always go to try to find one thing but i alway find som other thing that i am intrested in and get it too.      The fact that some books cuss and use diffrent types of gardin and thing likr that jus makes it beter to read. censondship in libraries should only go to an extent"	7572	7573
5276	2	"i think some books should be taken off the sheleves because of the way the use racial remarks, use of a lot of bad language, and the way the use drugs in some of there books. they should be setting a good example for us, as in teenagers. they are making it seem like they want to promote drugs, sex, ect. to even small kids that they dont even know what sex is, they still think that kissing is still bad.      i know if it was one of the author's child and he/she was reading something like that, @NUM1 times out of @NUM2 the author is gonna be mad cause they are same situation as a concern parent. a lot of music is either talking about sex and drugs. it all started in the mid @NUM3's- early @NUM4's. thats what almost ever song back then was talking about was either sex or a type of drug. now songs in this time they are still talk about the same thing as they did in the @NUM3's-@NUM4's.     i wouldnt want my son, daughter, neice, or nephe, reading something like that or listening to music like that at a young age. if you really think about it everywhere you go someone is promoting sex and drugs. wether is having condoms sold at a store or promoting beer thats on sale. everywhere you go one of those to things will fall into play. be careful cause someone might be watching you so choose wisely the choice that you make in life cause one little choice can and will mess up your @CAPS1 life. wether is playing the sport you love on a full ride of even if its a little bit of a scholarship"	7574	7575
5277	2	"Everyone has their own taste. Everyone also has their own opinion's. One's opinion on book censorship though is that it should be abolished. Everyone should think it is ethically and morally wrong.     We as people have a right to choose what we read. If we allow book censorship that right would be taken away from us. Also we as @CAPS1 are big on our right's, so this book censorship should be a big no.     Another reason one thinks it is wrong is because there would be no fair way to distinguish good books from bad ones. It would be based on someone's opinion. Which we all think that basing rules on someones opinion is wrong. There would be no way everyone would agree with the books that are censored. We see this in prime example in the movie @CAPS2 @NUM1. In that movie you see books being censored and the outrage that followed.      So as you can see book censorship should not be allowed. It would be a disgrace to our nation, and our society as a whole. It would also make us no better that the people in the movie that one has mentioned. It would just put our contry in a state of disorder, controversy, and mayhem that we do not need"	7576	7577
5278	2	"Books are full of knowledge that help people learn new things. Some of that knowledge people do not like being shown. Every book is offensive to somebody somewhere. The right thing to do is either get a different book or do not read. The librarian will not care if its offensive to you because they are not getting paid by you they get paid by the @ORGANIZATION1.     Little kids should not be aloud in libarys if they are not with a parent. Little kids usually do not want to read anyways. This only is offensive to adults and senior citizens. If the librarian is smart and sees the book and usually would read books all day would know if its for adults or kids. Its not the kids fault if they want the book, music, movies, or magazines. A lot of kids these days do not even like reading they just do @CAPS2 when they have nothing else better to do or they do @CAPS2 for school. Kids now like violence and sreamo bands just becasuse they are rebels against their parents.     Libarys are usually not around a lot because technology is leaving @CAPS2 in the dust. If we want to look up a books, music, movies, and magazines we would just look @CAPS2 up. Everything is at our finger tips when technology is in our grasp. Then you do not have to was money on gas to get their maybe paying late fees and gas back to your house. Ipad, @CAPS1, laptops, computer are all the things that technology has given us so that we can read on the go or play games wirelessly. Technology is great for the people who know how to use @CAPS2.     I do not thing that books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from librarys because its the kid or adult who wants to see @CAPS2. You can not stop every kid and every adult from finding @CAPS2 somewhere. Since libarys are funded by the @ORGANIZATION1 you would have to go through the @ORGANIZATION1 to stop @CAPS2 not just through libarys itself. If people do decide on trying to get ride of offensive things in libarys @CAPS2 would take a long time for that to happen and when @CAPS2 does happen most of the books in libary are going to be gone because almost every book is offensive to someone. Also what are you going to do with all those books.     If you @CAPS3 the books your making more polution in the air. Books and magzines are recycleable put what happens wih the movies and music. What would happen when we run out of energy to power computer how will we learn anything. I say that people Should not care about other people they should only care about themselves. @CAPS2 is up to the librarian if @CAPS2 is safe for the kid to have."	7578	7579
5279	2	"Libraries should be a good place for young children and adults to have fun. When you go to a library to want to read a book, go on the computer, look at magazines, or find movies that you  can bring home for everybody else. What should be moved from the shelves are things that aren't appropiate for young children or teens.     Little chilren love to read books when their at the library. It gives them something fun to do instead of just sitting and doing nothing. Chilren can get more education by focusing more on school and reading thingas when they do go to the library. They can bring things in school that are appropiate for show-and-tell. Books are fun to read expically if your really interested in them.     Young children read lots of books that have pictures in them because it is very interesting to see what's going on as you read. Older children tend to read books that have less pictures in them because their getting to the age they want to read bigger books. Tennagers read books about what's going on in life or maybe their favorite book that just like them. Adults read books that are more for them. Their books have things that little kid's shouldn't read unless it is appropiate for them.     Other than books, movies and magazines are also very interesting as well. You find lots of things you haven't seen or heard of before. You can get as many books or magazines as long as you bring them back on the date that is giving to you or its costes money if it's late. You will enjoy being at the library as much as I do. I love reading books and getting movies."	7580	7581
5280	2	"The things in libraries are obviously there for a reason and in my opinion they should be left there. It is everyones choice on what book or magazine they take off the shelf. If you dont like it, then don't grab it! There are a lot of different views out there with different people and what should and should not be allowed in a library. To me, it doesnt really matter because I get to choose what I want to check out and walk out of the store or school with.      There are a lot of importing things in a library that some people @MONTH1 think are innapropriate. People can have thier own oppinions and they are perfectly intitaled to use them but its really not nessecary when it comes to a libraby and the contents in it. A person @MONTH1 not like the fact that there are things in the library that are talking about religions and what ones are bad and what ones are good, Or they @MONTH1 not like seing magazines that talk about sex in it. Not everyone is going to like everything in this world!     I think that the things in libraries are put there because todays society wants to know about those things. If we want to know about those things then why would people take offence to it? Everyone has a choice in life and a choice on what they want to read, listen, and watch. If someone doesnt like something they need to just walk away from it or just relize that it is how this world is, and not worry about the things that are in librarys when we have bigger things to worry about"	7582	7583
5281	2	"Do you believe that offensive materials like movies, books, music, or magazines should be removed from shelves they are found on. Personally I do think really offensive materials should be moved off the shelves. I will tell you why I know they should be taken off the shelves.     I know that offensive material such as race, names, and religon get to people. People who say, write, show, and sing things that are offensive to other knows  that they should not do it. Most people think it wouldn't be interesting if there was't anything offensive towards someone in a movie, book, music, or magazine.     I beilieve that anything that has to do with race needs to stay out of books, movies, music, magazines. A lot of people get hurt by what people say about their race and other people think it is funny but it's really not it's hurtful. It does not matter what color your skin is, it matter who you are as a person. Most people look at the color of your skin and assume who you are even though you could be the brightest, sweetest, trustworthy person they have ever met or have known. People need to take a look at what they are saying and doing that might be offensive to other people out there.      Name calling is a big issue in books, movies, magazines, and music. People are so used to name calling now days they don't even realize what they are doing or saying to one another. It just not in books, movies. magazines, and music. It's in everyday life. Name calling should quit everywhere. On movies when people call people fat and somebody watching it is bigger then the person on tv it makes them feel bad about themselves. People need to watch what they say.     Religion is another big issue used everywhere especially at school. Kids go around calling kids @CAPS1, muslims different things. Kids do not understand that other people take offense to that. It also hurts those kids because they feel weird. They were born into that religon, it is not their fault they were born that way. Just because they were born that way does not mean they are any different then anyone else.      I beileve that things people put out there that are offensive need to be taken off the shelves or wherever they are at. When people read, see, or even hear things about race, religion, and name callling it hurts them, even if they don't want to admit to it. That is why I think offensive things should be taken away."	7584	7585
5282	2	"Have you ever read a book and wished that you had never picked it up in the first place? I have. I believe there is different censorships we should take upon people according to their age limit. Today I'm going to be persuading you on keeping censorships in school libraries.      When I was younger my mother had shelves and shelves of books that were all in order according to the types of plots they contained. I remember that the top shelf was romance novels. I was not allowed to touch them but one day I went against her word and shifted through some. Some of the chapters were extremely graphic and left me red-faced when my mother found out what I had read. Needless to say it was awkward and it fast-forwarded 'the talk' by a good five years. I ended up truly regretting even looking at it.     First, I believe elementary school libraries should be censored the most. By censorship I mean removing any books that contain foul language and graphic scenes of violence or nudity. This is common sense that a child of such a young age should not be exposed to such things. Small children are very innocent and tend to act upon anything and everything they see, read, or hear. It is best for their well-being that they aren't yet exposed to these things.     Second, I believe that middle school libraries should also have censorship, but one of a lower degree. At this age most children are growing into pre-teens and therefore becoming more curious about the things around them. They are maturing but still naive. I think at this age anything with sexual references should be kept on a lock. It is obvious that this is the time that they will be most curious about these things but it is not something they should learn about from a book. They are not at a level of maturity to take it seriously without making mistakes because their hormone levels are out of wack.      Thirdly, I believe high school libraries should have the lowest amount of censorship. At this age students are nearing adulthood and therefore more aware of violence, sex, foul language, and offensive language but not so young that they will act upon something just because they have read it in a book. This is the age of learning. Learning about the world and learning about people. As they are nearing the level of adulthood they should be exposed to everything that they can in a safe enviroment otherwise they will try to learn about it in other ways that could be harmful.     In conclusion I believe there should be certain levels of censorship in our school libraries. Hopefully you will all take this into account and possibly even limit the types of things your own child is exposed to in the future. Remember, sometimes there will be books that you will wish you had never picked up"	7586	7587
5283	2	"Should We @CAPS1 Offensive Materials On Shelves     No, I think you should @CAPS1 offensive @CAPS2's, Magazines, @CAPS3, and newspapers on shelves. People have different interests, beliefs, life styles, and family cultures which will effect there choices.     There are many people out there that have different interest and like different things and also think different things are offensive. If you took all the @CAPS2's or magazines off the shelves that are offensive to one  person you could have a big mess on your hands. People are going to become infuriated with you. You just can't take one persons interest and not include anyone elses opinion.       People have different life styles and beliefs. Some people @MONTH1 think that a bloody magazine or a mean article is offensive. Others @MONTH1 think that it is a simple fact of life. Life is a reality that we all have to deal with whether we like it or not.     Some people have different family cultures and think different things are offensive. One family @MONTH1 think that a comedy movie is bad, but another family @MONTH1 think it is alright to watch it and doesn't see any problem with it.     I hope you would please help me support my ideas and become involved by voicing your concerns, too.  Everyone should have the opportunity to make their own choices, not to have them made for them.  Say 'no' to removing materials from our libraries"	7588	7589
5284	2	"I believe libraries should organize the books by maturity level, not age or grade. If a book, magazine, movie, etc., is found offensive to one person, that does not mean that every other person who encounters that same book will also be offended by it. I agree with @PERSON1 when she says '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' because not everyone thinks or understands the same way. It is impossible to please every person any single library will encounter.     If media is organized and seperated by maturity level, then the only thing a person can complain about if they see something they find offensive is not being able to locate the area their brain can handle. Often, people are offended by things they do not understand in the first place. Another reason people can be offended is because they don't know as much as they think they know about the subject matter of the said media source. I @MONTH1 want to remove a book you anxiously intended on reading. Because I was offended by it, you no longer have the opportunity to read that book.     I also do not belive libraries should be organized by age. For example, there are some people in my grade who can read @PERSON2 without a problem. I, on the other hand, can not because my brain doesn't understand @CAPS1 writing as well as others in my grade. Another reason libraries should not organize by age is, for example, because no adult has the right to tell a ten-year-old child he or she can't read a certain book because the adult doesn't think the child is old enough to understand what the book is about.     I firmly believe that if libraries are going to give any random person the right to remove books which they find offensive, then they should allow babies and other young children to lie down in the middle of the library and scream and cry and kick and throw their own temper-tantrums. Why won't library managers allow that to happen? Because the library is meant for any and every one to be able to come in and help themselves to what it is that they need on their own. They're not like fast-food restaraunts, where if an item doesn't sell well enough due to buyers' disapproval, it is removed.That wouldn't be fair to those buyers who did approve.     In conclusion, I believe media should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I do, however, believe that if libraries were to do this, they would simply shut down because libraries aren't meant to accomodate just one person. They are for the public altogether, and for those who don't like it, they just shouldn't go to the library at all. For example, I'm sure libraries won't shut down just because a @CAPS2-@CAPS3 didn't like the section about the @CAPS4."	7590	7591

5286	2	"Censorship. Some people like it, others don't.      I feel like censorship should used in some places and some places I think its okay to not use it. Places where I feel it should be used include, papirazzi taking dirty pictures of people, books talking about violence and hatred, music with lyrics that are unbearable, and magazines that influence children to do what they are doing. More and more children are listening to music that belittles women and talks about drugs, sex, and violence. All these examples have a negative influence on everyone. My mom always tells me to listen to the music as if my grandparents were in the room with me. I wouldn't want them to hear all the negatives in the music I listen to. I left out movies because movies have ratings. I know a lot of people don't go by the ratings though, I believe that parents should monitor what their children watch. They should also read the ratings on video games. Video games are growing popular and popular day by day. A lot of the youth play games that I'm not even allowed to play yet! All this shooting, stealing, and brutally killing people games are way too much for a six year old to be playing. They're only getting to see the dark side of life with these games and not the good. I haven't even began to talk about the worst of all. Computers. Yes, computers. Computers are great to have when you want to look up something, but they are also a burden because of all the filth they have on it. Kids are so technologically advanced that they could probably find about anything they wanted to.  Computers don't have any privacy whatsoever. Facebook and @CAPS1 can get a lot of people in trouble because they have no privacy. This is why I don't have an account on either of them. Cell phones are also a problem. Texting while driving, sexting, and prank calling people can get someone in a whole heap of trouble. Combining the computers and cell phones is just a disaster in your hand. I think it is sad when their are commercials for get out and play an hour a day.      I just hope that when I have children of my own that none of them has to deal with all the unsafe things on @CAPS2, cell phones, or computers. Censorship in my opinion is a blessing to have"	7594	7595

5288	2	"Libraries of @CAPS1     Do I think that libraries have the right to disallow what comes into them, absolutely. I strongly believe that libraries should fill  their shelves with a vast variety of material. On the flip side though, I also believe that libraries should have some control over what they are allowed to have on their shelves. If I was able to have control over what was put into the library, I would try as hard as I can to keep that material out of there.     I would want to keep the certain materials out of my library due to the certain fact of what is it trying to promote? That illegal activites are for the cool kids, or that if you do certain stuff you will become famous. That is not the right way to go about your business in this world. Although, that happens quite often, it isn't the way you should go about living your life.     I will also say that some books that are most likely in ever library across the nation should stay.  As the on for '@ORGANIZATION1' that book should stay in libraries no matter what. Due to the fact that it doesn't lie about the past at all. It shows you how the what those times were like, and how people went about there ways. Sure you can make that arguement that they have fowl language, but thats how it was. Of which, thats what makes that book a classic, and why it should stay.      Another arguement people could make is that it is a public building, and that anything or everything should be in it. Though that is true why would the people running the libraries due such a thing. Why would they waste there time to make the libraries a safe place, so that they can tear it apart by putting bad material in it. It would never happen that way. Even if you were to walk into the library @CAPS1, you would most likely see either older people or little kids. And @NUM1 out of @NUM2 times they would most likely not want to see that material on the shelves at the library.     So as years go on libraries might change their content of the library, but they might not. If libraries allow for that to happen you would have to ask yourself is this, what is society coming to if they allow bad material to be put into the libraries?Though it is not a question anyone would want to answer, it is one that some one will have too"	7598	7599
5289	2	"There are way to many complaints in parent's kid's  libraries about books, movies, magazines, and etc that many parents dont like. But I dont think personally that they need to be removed or anything. For an example if the parent dosent like the book then they should see if the book can get move to a different section for older kids or even to the adult section. So as you @MONTH1 see there are complaints about things that should not be in our libraries that I think should and here are some of my examples why.     First off if there are complaints about something that is in our libraries then there needs to be more then one report on it, not just one. Like for instance get more people to agree with you on why they don't wont there kid to read that book. Then once you get enough people have a meeting in the libray about that book and why you dont wont it in there.Then if you get votes or people to agree have the book turned in and it checked then if the head people agree then they can remove the book. So that is one thing you can do.     My second reason is what if the kid likes the book but the parent dose'nt what do you do? Ask the librarin to put lables on the section like for another example, make one side about sports books and then maybe the other side can be about horror or crime. Then the parent can tell there kid or kids what section to not look at and to look at. I say this because different parents @MONTH1 have different thoughts on what book they want there kid or kids reading. So that would be my second reason.     Now my third and final reason on what the parent can do is just dont do anything. Now I know that sounds very dumb and stuff but really just dont do anything. I say that because if they find it interesting to read or watch at least there learning and will like it. Except if its like a rated @CAPS1 movie or something, or a book only for adults. Now that is when you don't let them read it or watch it .But eventually kids are going to get older and as they get older there going to want to read stuff that many parents do not want them to read. But the parents should just let them but keep a close eye on what there reading in watching and explain it to them if they have a question or something. So that would be my final reason.     So in conclusion them are some things parent can do if they don't want there kid or kids reading or watching a certain thing that is in there libray. Like have a meeting or get votes to get a book passed on not getting read. Or have the books labeled section by section. Or even my final reason just let them read it. So them are my thoughts and opinions on what parent can do if they don't want there kid or kids reading or watching a certain book or movie and there libray"	7600	7601

That is just like trying to removed nonfiction books because you don't read them. Someone watches those movies, read those magazines, and listens to that music. That is unfair to all of the people who takes those things to their interest.     I want to know why do people want those things remove from the shelves. What did magazines and movies do to them? Those people have no consideration for other people. Those people are just thinking about themselves. Some people look forward to reading one of those magazines or watching one of those movies everyday"	7602	7603
5291	2	I am writing a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship.     I think if a book has so much censorship in it that it then needs to be put in a section where only people at the right age should be able to view it. Cause I know I would not appreciate my kid looking at a book or anything with censorship in it.      I've read a book that had censorship in it and I would not aprove for my child to read it or anyones child too either. If I had the choice the censorship books should only be sold or viewable at a certain place for the mature person that is old enough to view it.     I think if an author can write a book with censorship in it and he/she mst not care about the younger kids or there own if they have any. So I hope they wouldn't aprove it for there child to read. Then why should my child?      I really hope that an author would consiter my statements cause it would make me upset if I was a parent and I know it would make my mother or father upset to know I read a book with censorship in it if I was younger and I know it would make any other parent upset to see or know that there child has or had to read a book with censorship in it	7604	7605
5292	2	"When you look at the books of @DATE1, do they look offensive to you?    Mankind has found that books that people enjoy are the offensive ones. The reason for this is probaly because when a person reads something of non-offensive, the story to them would be less entertainable to them. Humans tend to find offensive stories to most liking, since they find them more funny, but when you have children, I don't think you'd want them to have that book or they might pick up the wrong idea. People also find that music with offensive things tend to be better then regular non-offensive music.   The offensive type of music, we usally find mainly is rap or rock music. Rap is very offensive on mutliple accounts, on how it gives women a crudy name in society or how it show most of the african society on how life should be, @CAPS1!!!! Rock music is offensive in several way. The genres of rock are @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS2. Rock talks about drugs are the way to go or @CAPS3 you believe in is a @CAPS4!!! Everything we really listen to has some sort of offens in it, no music is safe anymore, thats for sure.    The movies of @DATE1 are tainted with offensive evil, such as women descrimination or teaching teens about sex, drugs and, drink is the best way to enjoy life. Mankind movies are slowly become more and more offensive to everything that we think is right. When those born for this new year see these new founded shows, they begin to draw the mental new image of whats the new right and bad wrong. The new right is about drugs and sex is the best thing to do and the new wrong is to not avoid things that might harm your life style or the way people view you in society, they see nothing about you in good ways.     Things in this world are harmful and offensive to all that we know or like. Human have adapted to this founded life style of complete destruction. Mankind has turned our once most powerful brain into mush and sketched out a new crudy image for use to believe in."	7606	7607
5293	2	"My opinion is @LOCATION1 should not take books, music, movies, magazines,etc., of the shelves or take them of shelves of stores. Reason why is because everybody or at least @NUM1 person has the likes and dislikes and some people might be offened but other might like the book that the others are offended by. The people that offended shouldn't just read the book and leave it alone. With music they have edited version for parents that don't allow cursing, or swearing in their house. Another is I think censorship should be banned because people should mature and grow A sense of humor because eventually in life you will hear these words. Some books also have racist terms in them like the books about the slaveship usually has the @CAPS1 word in it and most of the time that word is used in rap/hip hop alot and most of them are everyday words for people.     Also @NUM2 out of @NUM3 children, or parents will most likely hear these words sometime or some point of their life. They could hear it in the car, outside, home, stores, movies, and most likely in schools. I know where I grew up at and where I also live I hear alot of words that are bad everyday. Its somewhat a part of life and you will hear it. Also alot of teenagers listen to music and watch music videos, and will hear the cursing and the swearing in the lyrics. A few months in the past I did A debate @CAPS3 about banning parental advisory and censorship And the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 says that no citizen should be aborted from what they have to say.     Now A days rap/hip hop has changed and people dont really pay attention to the lyrics or whats said in song, or the meanings, for example @PERSON1 calls herself a bad @CAPS4 and most teenage girls idolize her and they also say what she says but little do they know they're calling theirselves the @CAPS4 word. Also with freshman lyricist/rappers they mostly talk about sex, money, and drugs which is not the everday life for an average citizen but most teenagers idolize those rappers and want to be exactly like them so they follow what artist false claim and lie about they are and the teenagers go outside doing those type of things they say. My opinion stays the same but the only thing i think that should get censored or removed is the things that people talk about like sex, money, drugs unless they're against it and trying to prove a point to the young adults.     Now you know my opinion and what i think about censorship/parental advisory and if the things people get offended by should be taken off. It will stay the same and the people thats offended by the things thats wrote, said, or spoken about just walk away or don't listen to any of it and find something that fits you and that you enjoy its over a million books and you can at least find @NUM1 that you like and that you can share with relatives, friends, or associates. But think about it some of those words can expand your vocabulary or even relate to you in some sort of way. But whatever you don't like everyone else doesn't have to not like it. Just enjoy another book, music, movie, or magazine."	7608	7609
5294	2	"For the past twenty years, @LOCATION1's children have become more and more susceptible to bad choices. Violence and other bad choices of growing children has led to more problems in the @CAPS1 society. While some of these problems could go back to the parents, these problems could also go back to what children see and hear. This includes books, movies, music, magazines, and other forms of media. So what can people, including parents, do to prevent a harmful upbringing of children?     Movie ratings have helped to somewhat prevent underage children and teenagers from seeing films that include inappropriate content for their age. However, some movies are not correctly rated, allowing children to watch the films that include profanity, sexual content, and violence. With this happening, this allows children to learn about all of the bad choices people make in the world. Children follow after role models that they see in movies, and if they see that celebrities make bad choices, whether in movies or in real life, they will also start to make those bad choices. To help prevent children from seeing inappropriate movies, those who decide the rating of the movie should come up with new standards on which to rate the movies.     Movies should not be the only media source that should recieve a maturity rating. Books, magazines, and music should also include ratings. Books, as well as music, can include content such as violence, and sexual references. Magazines provide information about the lives of celebrities, good and bad, and also include pictures that are sometimes questionable. When children go to the store with their parents and they check out, usually their first observation is of the candy. Most stores place magazines, some with covers unsuitable for children, next to the candy. This can cause children to get bad impressions of what their life is supposed to be like.     When people go to buy books, magazines, movies, and music, they should have to be of a certain age to buy certain media products. This could help stop spread the amount of innocent children that are harmed by the sights and sounds of @CAPS1 media. As soon as children stop learning about violence and other bad choices, @LOCATION1 will become a better nation, both in safety, and in morality."	7610	7611

All books are edited; which means that they are checked over and over again for mistakes such as spelling, or grammar and many other trypes of errors.  Censoring a book is taking the ideas of the storyline and altering them to fit one persons needs.  This act takes away from how the author has intended you to read it.  The way it was put on the shelf is the way the author wants you to take it in.     Removing a book from a library shelf is even worse.  When a book is removed from a shelf in any library around the country, or even the world, the author is notified of it and why it was removed.  This is the same as an artist hanging one of his most prized paintings in his studio and someone coming in and throwing it away because they didn't like the color scheme.  If a book is removed from a shelf, the person who wanted it to be removed is insulting the author for what they believe or know. This should not be allowed.     Many years of research have been funded to find out what causes people become offended to a point where the want a book removed from the shelf, or altered in its ideas.  The three main causes of this are: beliefs in religion, politics and sex.  Researchers are still unsure why people are so upset about these vast topics, but they are working diligently stop it.     Trying to remove a book from a library shelf is like taking a new car off a car lot because you didnt like the interior.  It simply is not right!  Books are written as the author feels they should be written; and they should stay that way.  Censorship and removal of books in libraries across the country should be stopped.  Does it make you feel good when you try to change what someone has already done?"	7612	7613
5296	2	"In this essay i will tell you my views on why the books should stay on the shelvs of the library even if they are offensive or not. I will also tell why it is a bad idea to have them, and give you different options to use for the libraries that have offensive music, books, magazines ect.     In my oppion i do not think that the offensive books should be taken off of the shelves from the library. On the other hand, i think that having offensive books, music, magazines, and everything elese is a very bad idea to have in a librarie, just because it is a public place. Another way to maybe take care of the solution and have everyone happy is: @CAPS1 the books that are found offensive on a different shelve and have that shelve labled. This way, moms and dads can watch there kids on were they go to look at a book. They wont have to be worried about there child looking at a book that is found inproperate, or bad in any means. You could also take care of the situtation by putting a completley different room for adults only, or an age limite to enter the room. Personaly i have not found or experianced any offensive books, movies, music, or magazines in my time at being in the library. I do not know how bad that they come, so that is why i think that my idea on seperating the offensive books from the childerns books would be a good idea. This would help out many concerned parents. This could also lead into, having the different age group books in the libraries seperated. This way it could be easyer to find a book that would be for you. Or for you child.      This is what i think should happen among the libraries. This would most deffently help out the parents that think the offensive books should be taken out compeltey. It wuld also help the people that like the offensive books to come back to the library. This is an idea that would make everyone happy."	7614	7615
5297	2	"Have you ever been at a library and you seen a book on the shelf that you dont exactly agree with? Did it make you upset? In this essay I will give you my point of view on what I think should be aloud in any public library.     A library is a place where anyone can go and use the resources there to find information on any topic. In a library there are some things in there that should and should not be censored. Books or magazines that have no racism evident in the text or any other kind of discrimnating in them is okay for a public library. The reason I believe this is because there are people in the worl that will take this offensive. We don't know about everybodys beliefs and the way they was raised. Movies that I believe is appropiate for a public library is basically the same for books and magazines. For music, it is the librarys choice and the people looking for it. If you dont want the music then don't get it.     Stuff that should be not aloud in the libraries is books about things that have happened in our history. Peoples ancestors could have been involved in that and it could be a sensitive subject to them. Magazines on the other hand is a different story. Magazines should be aloud to be there regardless because people like to keep up on current events and stuff like that. Movies, they should keep movies out of librarys and they should make the people order them online.     In conclusion, it is ultamitly the librarys choices for what they want in there library. People will still have to deal with stuff like that, there is racism and discrimination everywhere and we will never get away from it."	7616	7617
5298	2	"I think that people should not have restritions on there moveis or anything eles. There should not be restrtions on movies, songs, and magazines. Movies should have no restrtions.     Movies are good just how they are. @CAPS5 of them can be better. Like having more war violence in history flims, like @CAPS1 @PERSON1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Because they need to show how dangerous it really can be and how we should support the troops that fight for our freedom. Movies can be good if the restritions are lifted.         @CAPS5 songs speak the @CAPS6 and the @CAPS6 should be heard. @CAPS5 songs are disbanded destroyed because one song tells the @CAPS6 about something small. For example @CAPS5 songs during the @LOCATION1 ear were disbanded because they sang on why we shouldn't be in @LOCATION1. Most of those songs were right to. Songs help us deal with most of the @CAPS6 that is going on in the world. @CAPS5 songs tell else the @CAPS6 nothing eles.     Magazines can't tell the @CAPS6 all the time either. Magazines are checked by most @CAPS7 and they need to have the @CAPS6 eith them without censorship or restritions. They sometime sugar coat a lot of things. Like they tell people that a famous celebrite has not been doing drugs when its easy to tell that they are using them. Magzines should tell the @CAPS6 about a lot of things. @CAPS5 I can't tell you because there is a censorship or restrition in the paper that I'm sending this to.           Censorship can be an important downfall of the people of the @ORGANIZATION1. They tell lies to protect us. Well @CAPS5 people like me want to hear only the @CAPS6"	7618	7619
5299	2	"I believe that no book should be taken off the shelf if it is offensive. Everybody has their own preferences to books, movies, etc. i think it is unnacceptable if the government can take something that someone likes reading because it is offensive to a certain type of people. If someone thinks the book is offensive than why pick it up and try taking it off the shelf, because someone else might like that book.      Everyday people hear stuff that is offensive. But it is how they handle it that matters. The childish ones act like a fool, and the mature ones just let it go because they know its not worth it. I believe that you need to be at a certain maturity level to read some books, because younger kids might act like what the character does in the book, or say bad language because they think it is appropriate.     If we had censorship in everything that we see, the world would be a whole lot different. I think it would be different because movies or anything that does not have offensive stuff in it is usually boring and not that funny. We deserve to have the right to not have censorship, and if you are a parent and don't want your child watching something in particular, set a lock on the channel. I say this because everybody has different preferences for what their family watches.     There are many different views on censorship, but mine is to not have censorship on everything offensive, partly because sometimes the truth can hurt, but it makes the world not seem like a great place that has nothing wrong with it. So all-in-all, i think people should be the ruler of censorship because they know what they like and don't like."	7620	7621
5300	2	"There are certain aspects of offensive literature that probably should be removed from libraries rather than let them stay on the shelves, because they can spread negative ideas and morals. For instance, books from the @DATE1's might have books that have to do with how people felt about slavery or how they treated others. While it is a reference source in history, it should only be used with great care because some people @MONTH1 acquire a negative way of thinking from reading it. So maybe books with that kind of a topic could be stored in a seperate part of the building of a library for research purposes.      There are some books that are wrongfully censored because the person in charge believes that it is improper or the wrong kind of message. In some cases though that @MONTH1 not be the true, but merely a conflict of views and that doesn't make the book wrong. Other books are censored for the right reasons because they @MONTH1 hold information on how to do something against the law or tell about discrimination against a certain type of people. Censorship is a good way to keep things with a message to spread negative thinking low.     Another thing you might find being censored in a library is music, due to the lyrics or the message. In music people @MONTH1 use profanity in their lyrics which is common in a lot of different forms of music now. Libraries don't usually like to keep around music with such lyrics and might be guilty of removing those songs from their collections or never procurring them at all. Lyrics can also deliver messages that a library might deem unfit to be heard by the public because it involves shooting or drinking and drugs.     Movies might also be censored while they are inside a library. Movies come with a rating system, @CAPS1. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3-rated, etc. These ratings are made for the audience, so that those who @MONTH1 not be mature enough for its content cannot watch it. So movies that are @CAPS3-rated @MONTH1 not be available to people under @NUM2 since that is the required age to view such a movie.     I think that materials in libraries are censored with good judgement and are taken from the shelf for a reason. Sometimes a book, a movie, a song, or whatever it @MONTH1 be, is removed for its own message being offensive or inappropriate. It is for these reasons that censorship can be a good thing to use, so that we dont spread negative thinking amongst our peers. However that does not mean we can just remove a book from our libraries at any time if we just so choose, that is an abuse of power, and so censorship should be only used with great care"	7622	7623
5301	2	"I enjoy reading many books at our local library all the time. I go there often and sit down and read a book recommened by the librarian. Reading takes up a large amount of my free time. I have read a variety of different books from '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to 'A @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4'. Both books I have mentioned are banned in certain libraries.      The title escapes me, but another book I have read was about the government censoring literature. I think the author's name was '@PERSON1'. The ironic part was that this book was also banned in certain libraries. I really liked reading the book, but the problem was that it was banned in my library too. I don't believe in a society where people can remove materials from shelves if they're found offensive.     One of the problems with censorship, is that anything can be found offensive. For example, you can have a nonfiction book about the theory of evolution. Some religious people @MONTH1 find this book blasphemous based on their beliefs. You @MONTH1 also have a book dealing with atheism. Most of the other religions are against this and therefore makes it offensive. The examples can go on and on.     Music comes in many forms. Metal gets one of the worst reputations in music because of the sub-cultures associated with it. Some people see it as music, others see it as a form of brainwashing the masses into doing bad actions. People cannot decide what is 'good' music or what is 'bad' music it is an opinion.     I understand that some materials aren't for children, but that is why there is a ratings system for music, magazines and movies. That is also why some libraries have an older audience section for the adults and one specifically for children. In these ways they prevent children from accidentally checking out materials that society feels that they shouldn't hear, read, or see. That really isn't censorship because those materials are still there, but require the child to be with an adult who give permission to what their child wants to see, hear, or read.        What some might find offensive, will seem like ordinary materials to everyone else. There's no set list in everyone's mind on what is and what isn't offensive. There will never be an agreement with everyone on what materials to remove. It is a black or white area; you either pick one or the other. I disagree with censorship in libraries."	7624	7625
5302	2	"I believe that depending on the information and historical facts the book gives, I think it doesn't matter how offensive the book or movie is as long as it sends the right message.      In today's day and age, young children are more open to things like violence and sex with resources like movies, video games, and even books at their own library. Some of these forms of violence can be unharmful with the right precautions, but some @MONTH1 be too much for children. I will state in this essay the content, how much, and things to prevent when our children are reading books.    Content is something you might not find by looking at the cover or the breif descripition on the back of the book. It's something the parents or guardians might have to look into. There is a possibilty that some of the librarians even might not know the content of the books. The only thing you can do as a parent is just do some research. If you are worried ,even a little bit, that a book might be harmful to children, get on the internet and do some research on the book. Look at some of the past books the author has wrote and then look up reviews on the book as well.          Now the real question is is how much of these more mature books can our children handle? Well it depends on how much your children reads. If your child is a frequent reader, make sure you are keeping track of what they read and how long they read each day. Also make sure they aren't reading too much. If they reading one of those more mature books then tell them to take their time on it and ask questions about it. This could really help your child understand why these books are like this and how it could help them to read in the future.     Now if you are harmful of your child's books of choice then there are ways to prevent them for reading those. You can put them around an enviroment where they are maybe open to reading different books. You can also show them different kinds book that are maybe less harmful to them. You can also just simply talk to them and tell them that book @MONTH1 not be suited for them at that time. Also make sure you child understands the reason why they are being able to read that book as well. Children are going to ask why and you should be able to have a good anwser for them.     Books help grow the brain and really open into a new vocabulary. Regardless whether you read one book every few months or your reading a new book every few weeks, they are good sources of learning at any age. Espically children. That's why children should be able to read these more violent books because it can teach them vocabulary skills and overall life lessons. It can help students into a whole new relm of books they can read and enjoy. Children are maturing more and more, but you must give them time to grow and help them along the way"	7626	7627
5303	2	"I believe that people should not be able to take books off the shelf if they found them ofensive. I think that if the people are offended by the book they should simply not read it because there might be someone that comes along and like it .As for the children I feel that the parents should warn them about the books but, they should be happy that they want to read because reading expands your vocabulary .                           I know if I was an aurthor I would be extremely angry if someone took my book off the shelf. Books sometimes take years to make and edit. We should all consider how taking the book away would affect everybody . Maby if it was a childrens book it'll have a bad impact on them like instead of reading they would get into more trouble. kids already dont have enough ways to express themselves but thats just my opinion.                                         I kind of know how the authors would feel if their books got taken off the shelf because im writing a book now I've been writing it for a year now and im still not done so when I get finished and get it published I would feel like it was all for nothing if someone decided to take it off the shelf.                                      I agree with Katherine if people could take books off the shelf ultimantly we would'nt have any books to read because everyone has there own opinoin and everyone feels different . That would leave us without any books for the younger generations to come .                                                                                      So in conclusion I think that it is good that people do not have the right to take books off the shelves because there is alot of bad that can come from that."	7628	7629
5304	2	"Censorship in Libraries      Do you think that it is fair to have libraries and other public places that sell books, music, movies, and magazines to have the right to tell us what we can watch, read, or listen to? I think that is probably the worst idea anybody could ever think of and those places would start to lose a lot of business.     They think that some movies that are rated @CAPS1 or even @NUM1 shouldnt be sold in libraries. Music with a couple of bad words. Books and magazines that talk about sex and drugs. Ya maybe these are not the best things to be talking about or showing, but some people learn off of this and they love this kind of stuff and if they were take it away then i think that would just be totally wrong. These things are what make people money. People like to watch good movies and a lot of those movies are not the best rated ones so you couldnt just take that stuff away.     I think this was a great topic to talk about because even though libraries and other places usually do not have censorships, its something that could be brought up in the near future and I think that it would start a big war. So keep censorship out of libraries!"	7630	7631
5305	2	"Censorship      @CAPS1 one ever wondered about censorship, and why people ban books? Well I have given it plenty of thought, and do not beilieve in censorship. If we censor books, magazines and movies/ shows, how are children/adults going to be able to learn about rasicm, and the cold harsh truth, and corecting mistakes. If everybody would stop trying to sugar coat things and trying to avoid the truth we would not have problems like the one at hand.     Learning about the truth. We can not hide the fact that people of diffrent ethinticites were given difrent names based on the color of thier skin. We can not hide the fact that bad things happen and that acts of terroism have ben preformed. By banning books, moves/shows and magizines this is what we do. the best possible thing that we could do is to keep those books alive!, so that people can learn from past mistakes and try to make this world a better place, not by trying to make everybody happy but by learning and not making the same mistakes, and that is the only way we can do this.     Avoiding the truth. Sure we can make everyone happy for a little while by doing this. However if we do this we can not, and will not solve the problem and correct the way people think, and act. For several years people have avoided the truth about many of things and there are informative documtery's and several books that cover these subjects, but because of the language that is used people want to have them banned. This is not fair to the people that wish to learn about these topics.     Censorship and the importance of knowledge. people who often want to have things cencored, wish so because a lack of knowledge on the subject. If there were more books or shows that people would watch/read they would learn from thier mistakes of censorship.      One could not stress this point enogh. If we continue these acts of censorship the world will grow to be a worse place. So now you know why should not censor things so next time you have the choice to vote, vote agianst censorship"	7632	7633
5306	2	"The idea of censorship is indeed helpful in some aspects of literature, such as in the printing of school newspapers, yearbooks, and magazines. After a work has been revised, edited and displayed on shelves in communities, everyone has a right to read it, and authors have the right to keep it on the market due to thier freedom of speech. Censorship in libraries to avoid offence is not realistic. Also, anyone @MONTH1 find offence from anything they wish to be offended by, and therefore, if there are many people who are offended by what they read, libraries will be left with nothing. Finally, if someone realizes something will be offensive in what they pick up at the library, they always have the choice not to pick it up.     The idea of using censorship in libraries is unrealistic. Shelves would be left with nothing, and knowledge would not flow freely. Say that someone did not like @ORGANIZATION1 and decided to rid it from the library, the poetry, the stories, everything would be lost. Students could not use a library book to help them with school work, and anyone who wished to study @ORGANIZATION1's works in a deeper context, would not have the resources. Also, if something like @ORGANIZATION1 would be removed from libraries, scholars would lose their look into the past, unable to study the language of @CAPS1 society and the ideas and lifestyles formed there. Something like this example would happen with many books and magazines, @CAPS2 and music, leaving us with nothing, and with no insights to other thoughts and ideas. There would be no exposure to new ideas and therefore no chance to learn. Just because a few people might agree that a material is a bad read or @MONTH1 influence someone in an undesirable way, does not mean that it will be bad for all people. What it comes down to is a matter of opinion and what one does with the knowledge they collect from a certain material.     Secondly, there is the matter that people can choose what to be offended by. Depending on the values they want to keep and whether or not they are willing to be influenced a certain way, will change their view. Take, for example, religion. If an athiest walks into a library and decides the @CAPS3 is offensive, @CAPS4 will be left with nothing. @CAPS4 will not find the @CAPS3 offensive, but on the contrary will want to share its good news with people who haven't heard the story of @CAPS6 becoming man to save the people @CAPS7 loved with a passion incomprehensible to the human mind. There is no way to keep from offending someone through a work of litereature. Different backgrounds and ideas will have caused different people to have contradicting ideas. There is not one film, song, book, or magazine in which someone will not be offended. In a teen magazine, what one girl might see as helpful beauty tips, another girl might see as a message saying she's not pretty enough to be seen by a boy. She could change her views to something different so she might not be offended by an article about beauty. Being offended is a mind game. Do you want to be offended by a particular subject? Or can you approach it with a different point of view?     Finally, instead of the option to change one's views, a person has the option of not picking up an offensive piece of literature in the first place. Through their work, authors try to convey messages, and if the public decides they don't want to hear a certain message, they have the choice to not pick up the book and leave it for someone who does want to hear it. Authors do not worry about the people they offend, but rather hope they can reach out to someone through their words. If someone writes a bad review on a piece of fiction I wrote since I am an author, my first responce would be '@CAPS8 did you read it if you knew you wouldn't like it?' No one is left without the option of putting down a book once they've been offened. In ancient @LOCATION1, @CAPS9 offended many with the words @CAPS7 spoke, contradicting what they were being told about @CAPS6. @CAPS7 offered new ideas of a loving @CAPS6, a life in @CAPS12 with him for eternity where everything was as it should have been before sin entered the world. There is no denying that @CAPS7 offended people, and they could have chosen to stay home instead of flocking to hear him speak. They could ignore his movement and decide not to listen to what @CAPS7 had to say. A library should be like this. It should be a place filled with ideas, many ideas which some people @MONTH1 not want to accept. Therefore, everyone is benefited by having the choice to read what they want to read.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a ridiculous idea because there is no way to not offend someone. To find something that is not offensive to anyone would be impossible. Therefore, the best way to structure a library is with a plethra of choices, filled with offensive literature expressing ideas someone @MONTH1 not like. In the end, who knows? One might actually benifit from hearing some good news they thought was bad. Censored libraries would be doing no favors."	7634	7635
5307	2	"In my opinon, books should never be taken down from the shelves of any library; no matter what the circumstance @MONTH1 be. The books should simply get placed in a different section. If you find yourself offended by a book; close it and return it.     Books have been around for hundreds of years. They are ment: to persuade, entertain, or inform someone about a specific topic. I have read plenty of books and i'v never seen a book as offensive. If the library took away every book that has offended someone else, how many books would we have left sitting up right on the shelves.      Libraries usually have sections dedicated to types of writing split up into age groups. The 'less offensive' or 'not offensive at all' books are found here. The higher the age goes the more detailed, exotic, and serious the manner gets. The worker of the libraryl: wouldn't allow your child to rent a book out that he did not think the student could handle.     Books are written and published for a reason. The author takes pride in his or her work. Who has the authority to take someone elses work of literature down from the shelves. Books are not ment to be offensive, to anyone. Therefore, read a couple paragraphs inside the story you wish to check out before you actually check the it out.      In conclusion, I believe strongly, that not a single book should be taken down from the shelves of a library simply because it offends one or two readers."	7636	7637
5308	2	"Have you ever gone into a library and thought wow why is this book allowed to be placed on the shelves? Most people have been in this situation many times before and realize that the libraries can not take every negative book of the shelves, but more of this problem could be solved.  Everyone knows that not all books are bad some are used towards positive things like entertainment, education, and have a variety of different purposes.     A few years ago, I took my six year old little brother with me to the public library to check out books for him to read for pleasure.  When we had reached the children's section where he would sit down calmly and search for a book, it dawned on me that I should be looking around to see what type of books are in the environment where he is sitting.  The first book he picked up was about @PERSON1 but to my dismay the very next book contained graphic and mature pictures and descriptions.  I immediately saw my little brothers eyes light up in fear.  He was utterly confused on the pictures he had just seen, and even more confused as to why this book was in his section. After he closed the book, I then told him that what he had seen was not appropriate and to be careful what he was reaching for.     This type of situation happens every day in public libraries.  Public libraries are made to be family friendly, but by putting derogartory books on the shelves parents and children are gaining the wrong message.  When a child grabs for a book on a shelf, they are reaching into a world which they have not yet experienced.  The child could accidentially grab a graphic book and be put into a uncomfortable position they have not ever been put through before.  When a child feels scared or insecure they will allow what happened to them in that instant to effect them in the future.      Public libraries do not need the image that they contain derogatory books that are not children and family friendly.They need books to help children grow and experience postive things that will impact the way they live there life.  Putting a negative book on the shelf runs the risk of that child being impacted in a negative way, while they are still growing and developing. Books are very useful tools to help children in experiencing things and help them to slowly gain information about the process of life.  Public libraries create a family friendly environment that children can be in and parents feel comfortable bringing their child to the public library.       If these negative influential books continue to be put on the shelves families are going to be chased away from public libraries and will try to find books some other place.  As a nation we need to take a stand and stop the spread of inappropriate books in libraries.  This can be simply solved by doing a book review about that specific book before placing it on a shelf."	7638	7639
5309	2	"In school students are there to learn. Books should not be removed from the shelter, but music should be. Now in this days music talks about sex, money, and alcohol. Sometimes the music even talks about the devil. We all know that all of those things are bad for our children. They are sent to school lo learn, not to hear music that will make them do things they are not supposed to do. Music can influence anyone to what wrong things.      Music has changed alot, now most of the music that students get to hear talk about having sex. Some students by hearing this they are more likely to be tempted to do  what the song says, they believe that is going to be nice and cool, just like the songs says. But that is not what it ends up being. They end up with their girl pregnant and they won't talke care of the baby. Students should just focus on whats good for them, they need to get good grades and to go to collage, they should worry about their future.      The music from now also talk about money. They believe money is everything, money is not everything! It's not as importat as they show it in the videos. Now in the videos they throw money, and they even show their dimonds they have. Students want to be like the famous people, but we are all different. We shouldn't really look at them as a roll model because all they are promoting in the videos is sex, money and alcohol.     How good is alcochol for you? Well, alcohol it's not the best thing for you to drink we all know that alcohol is like a drug, once you try it you'll like it and there is not really a way to stop it. Alcohol you can try to put it away, but you can't cure it. If the school lets everyone hear their music and let them do what they all want it would be a disaster. Schools shouldn't let students hear any type of song that talks about either sex or alcohol, because is like telling the students that its fine to do it. That there is nothing wrong with doing those things. Since it is wrong doing those things thats why schools don't let students here that type of music on schools.     In some type of music like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, she talks bad about @CAPS3. That type of music is wrong, because one things is to hear music, and another that in a song they are talking about your religion. I believe we all respect all the religions and that no one should tell you things about your religion in a song. In this type of songs they even talk about the devil. That is somenthing you don't want to be hearing about.      Music can influence someone to do things they shouldn't do. School should not allow that type of music that promotes alcohol, because now in this days who doesn't drink alcohol. Students think its cool, and that people are going to like them more if they drink with them, or even if they have sex with alot of girls. That is what this type of music tells students that alcohol and sex are the best thing that you can do. But the only thing that matters is who you really are and not what other wants you to be. Students should focus on their future"	7640	7641
5310	2	"When you go into a library what do you see? There are many people of all different kinds there. Everyone might like to read, listen, or watch different things. Taking some things off the shelves just because of their content isn't the right thing to do. There are many things you can do to make people aware of what they are about to get.     When you put a book, @CAPS1, or movie on a shelf, that doesn't neccesarily mean that everyone is going to get it. Many people have different taste. They like to view or read many different things. The library that I go to has many different sections for different types of books. That is one way to have people know what kinds of things they are getting.      Many people know exactly what they want. Most people wouldn't go looking for a book that would be offensive to them. If somebody picked up a book that had the possibility of being offensive, they probably wouldn't think much of it. They would probably be the kind of person not to get offended by it.     There are many things you can do to let people know that these books, movies, music, ect., have offensive content in them. One thing you can do is have a section for these kinds of books. Seperate them into the kinds of material the books might have.     Another thing you can do is right on the book or whatever it is your getting. Put that there might be some offensive material in here. If you you think you might get offended don't get it.      When you go to check out a book or movie, there is usually an overview of what it's about on the the back cover. Just by reading that, you can figure out if it would be offensive. If you think that you wouldn't like it, just put the book or movie down. It's not that big of a deal.     From my own experience I have come to find that some things have been kind of offensive. I don't usually get upset about it though because it was seperated into a section for more offensive books. By having them split up, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I got it.     I also see that many people don't find the things offensive. They know that it's just a story or movie and realize that it has nothing to do with them or their life. They usually get past the bad content in it and see the book or whatever they're getting for what it really is.     Taking books off the shelf is a pointless thing to do. There are many solutions to people who find them offensive. If they are split up into different sections or there's a warning on it, the people don't even have to get it. People have to decide for themselves if getting the book, music, movie, ect., is the right thing for them to do."	7642	7643
5311	2	"So their is alot of controversy about wither we should have more censorship on things. witch is a big deal if we do because then some of the things we like might be found to be offensive. so in that matter i have a few things that i would like to say about it and my thoughts towards the big decision.      To start off I would just like to say that their is nothing that offensive out their to where people have a problem with it. why take a look at it if you know it is going to offend you? the way i look at it is, it's a freedom of choice wither we want to read, see, or hear, about certain things. And no one is makeing you read it so why take it away from everybody? maybe someone wants to know about things but someone thought it was offensive so now they can't be educatied on that subject.      Next is the reason i feel how i do about this. witch is because people need to know things even if they offend someone else. for example some thing that offended me and doesnt offend someone else so i take it off the shelf but their is a book that i really like and it offends someone else then im not going to be able to look at that book anymore and if everyone does that then their will be nothing for us to learn or read about.      Last is my decision about this. My decision is that no, people should never be aloud to find something offensive and be able to take it away from someone else. its just not right and it takes away from everyone that doesnt find it offensive.      so to conclude this essay, their are alot of things out their that people read or listen to that they might take offensive but their should never be a way for someone to be able to take it away from the world witch is the main subject in this"	7644	7645
5312	2	"I believe that people should not be allowed to pull books off the shelves of a library if they do not like the book. If they do not like the book or books they can just not read it. If enough people were to complain about the book or books, then maybe it should be considered, but I do not think anyone should be allowed to pull books off of a shelf in any library. And not just books, it could be anything such as books, music, movies, or magazines.     With music and movies, there can be offensive language for anyone. If it is offensive to you, I would suggest just not listening or watching it. But whatever the case is, nobody should be allowed to pull the movie or music off of shelves at a library, at any library. While certain songs or artists are offensive to some people, a lot of other people might like them. The same goes for movies, there are certain movies that some people just might not like, but then again if you don't like it, you don't have to watch it, or listen to it.      Then, with books and magazines, there can be just about anything anyone can find offensive in them. There could be anything from offensive language to inappropriate behavior. But, again if you don't like it, do not read it. In magazines, there can be inappropriate pictures, words, and other things. In books, there usually aren't pictures, but some of the words can be offensive to certain people. You never know what one person will say is inappropriate and what is not. I still think it is wrong to just take books or magazines off of shelves in a library, or any library.      If there is something someone, anyone, finds offensive in a library they can tell the librarian if they wish to, or they can tell someone else. They can even choose to do nothing about it, if they would like to do that instead. Or, they can simply just choose not to read, listen, or watch whatever it is they do not like. It is there choice, and nobody can make it for them, except for themselves. But, still, nobody should be allowed to take anything off of a shelf in a library, in any library. Even if something in a library is offensive to your religion or beliefs you can simply not read, watch or listen to it.      So, all in all, my point is that just because something is offensive to you that is in a library, any library, you should not be allowed to pull it off of a shelf. I believe that it is just wrong, and should not be allowed to happen. Even if it is against your religion or beliefs, I still believe it should not be allowed"	7646	7647
5313	2	"One someone told me this 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor Then you also have exactly same right and so does evryone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive?            We are all made different evryone have their likes and disslikes. Some like scarry movies or funny moves, maybe druma, and action. I like action movie I like the on that keep you gussing who and what. I would't like if someone removed my faverit type of movie or book from the shelf. Most parent want nothing bad for their kids so they keep tham away from the stuff that is not good for their mind.             @CAPS1 is a big place open for public to come and injoy the books  and magazines, or the movies and music. I been to the @CAPS1 befor my first time was amazing. I am not a big reader but there were so many choces. People go to the @CAPS1 to find information, injoy their favret authers and books. I one went to the @CAPS1 and asked for a book they said someone lost it that made me mad people dont dont take care of public proporty.            If someone doesnt like what they see on the shelf don't take it. But i thing the idea of having the books rated like they do the movies. @CAPS1 does a good job obout that they have A-@CAPS2 and saporated by different cotagorys. If you go to the @CAPS1 you usualy look for what you want not something you don't want. So if people take something they dont like of the shelf they must not like somone who is reading it or who writen it.           I believe that materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines that have offensive thing in tham it mite not be for some people. Like i said we all made different  we have our own like and disslikes. @CAPS1 is a big place that has something for evryone. If you don't like something dont take it. And having things labled would be a big helf for anyone that is looking for something they like."	7648	7649
5314	2	"People say that certain materials should be moved off of shelves completely because some are found offensive. I believe that if someone would @CAPS1 like to see it, they should say something to the owner. Maybe the material can be put in a different section or shelf. @CAPS1 everybody finds the same thing offensive.     Books, movies, music, etc., is put in a spot for everybody to see. If one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that it automatically has to be off the shelf. Maybe that movie or music you hate so much, is my favorite. If you dont watch or listen to it, that don't mean someone else doesn't.     Music that has curse words and about offensive things could be your favor type. Maybe you like slow love songs, or even rock and roll head banging songs. Everybody has there own personality. People everywhere listens to all types of music. Just because she don't like or he don't like it don't mean 'you' dont like it.     Some things should be put in a different section if its very offensive. I could understand movies and magazines because some can be epic i guess you can say. Maybe a little kid dont like clowns or the 'boogie man'. Other people do though. It should get put in a different section @CAPS1 removed completely.     Everybody likes different types of everything. Just because a movie is scary, or certain music is @CAPS1 your type, doesn't mean you remove it from the shelves. Put it in a different area that is all the same stuff. If you find it really offensive maybe you should shop at a different store or talk to someone. I believe magazines, movies, books, music, etc., should @CAPS1 be taken off of shelves because theyre 'offensive'."	7650	7651
5315	2	"The media is a strong influence on society today. In fact, so much of what is delivered to the public comes with ratings or warnings before the program is even played. However, this process arises the question of whether or @CAPS1 our books should come with a 'Do @CAPS1 @CAPS2' label as well. The answer is no. Libraries should @CAPS1 be allowed to censor books because it is an unjust, opinionated, and insolent act.     To begin with, censoring one author's book as opposed to another's is a violation of equal rights. As part of the constitution states, citizens are allowed freedom of speech. This covers the idea of freely expressing one's opinions through writing. It is unjust for any library to remove an author's book based on what they have to say while leaving another's. The author whose publication is being censored has just as much right to voice his/her opinion as the next author. If a citizen does @CAPS1 agree with the author, the book should @CAPS1 be removed but simply passed over on the specific citizen's reading list. By removing any book on a shelf, libraries are taking away the legal right to freely express one's own viewpoint.     @CAPS1 only is removing library books from shelf unjust though, it is also an opinionated act. Every human being sees the world through their own eyes and judges it by their own experiences. Much of what authors write relate to their own life encounters or observations. Therefore, what one author writes about could relate to one reader while entirely offending another. However, this does @CAPS1 mean libraries should be allowed to remove it from the shelves. As the famous author @PERSON1 once said, '... if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no  books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, Paterson is saying that since opinions vary so greatly from one person to the next, then if libraries were allowed to pull every 'offensive' book off the shelf the library would be empty. This is because eveyone's opinions vary greatly and what one person might think is different than the next's. Therefore, libraries should @CAPS1 be able to censor books because it is a heavily opinionated act.     The last point that should be made is censoring libraries is inconsiderate to @CAPS1 only the author but the general public. When one removes a book from the shelf, he/she is preventing another from having the ability to @CAPS2 it. This gesture is @CAPS1 only then rude to the reader, but the author. In removing the author's book, one is degrading on the author's hard work put forth into creating the publication. The amount of time and effort put into publishing a book to then have it unseen to the public eye would be unheard of. @CAPS1 only this, but the public has just as much right to be able to @CAPS2 every book released to them as the author does to convey his/her's messages.. As a result, censoring in public libraries would be insolent to both readers and authors.     It should be made known though that many would argue about children and what these books expose them to. However, most libraries are categorized by age or matuirty level and then genre. Thus forth it is more so the parent's responsibilty to monitor where the child picks up a book from than the responsibilty of the library to censor it's selections. There is also the common argument of media influence. This influence is unavoidable though. In modern society, the media is everywhere and what one doesn't @CAPS2 in a book they are sure to come across on the internet, television, or even newspaper. Thus forth, to censor our libraries would mean having to censor other areas of media as well which again arises injustice and matter of opinion.     All in all, the point to be made is that there should @CAPS1 be censorship in libraries. Public opinion is a very controversial matter, but to pull the media further into it would be to ask for destruction. Censoring the freedom to express yourself is unjust and insolent. It also leads to the popular topic brought about in @PERSON2's @DATE1. If the public allows the government to censor our libraries, what will they truly start to censor from us?"	7652	7653
5316	2	"Libraries have certain sections for books, movies, magazines, etc., Should there be a certain section for the censored or offensive subjects?     There are many topics and other subjects that can be offensive to people. Example, @CAPS1 of hitlers bibliographies, or a story of a dog that ends up getting hit by a truck. Some people might find it fine, & not offensive, where other people might find it very cruel or offensive. The way I see it is if it is offensive to you, dont pick it up & read it, or watch it. Let it sit there for someone interested in it to read or watch it. Another way to help libraries about this conflict, would to have a section for certian subjects, movies, magazines, etc. There are a lot of topics that people @MONTH1 find offensive or disrepectful, so why not have it in a certain area, And have people that dont get offended go there and if they want to know more about it or read more about it, then read it.      I dont believe that the libraries should remove them from the shelves, just have a designated area for them. I have seen little children watch movies that are a bloody mess. It isnt right, so have a certain place for them movies & books. Writers and @CAPS2 work hard on there movies or books. They shouldnt have there book or movies removed from shelves just because some people @MONTH1 find it offensive.      Yes, there should be a designated area for certain books or movies or any other thing people @MONTH1 find offensive, but they shouldnt be removed from all shelves. I think that people take some things to far, but thats what some writers do, they emphasize on things that might need it"	7654	7655
5317	2	"Censorship in Libraries      @CAPS1 are lots of books in libraries. They can't take all of them off of the shelf. If we do that then @CAPS1 will be nothing left. However I do agree with the statement that some books can be very offensive to some people. But others have very important pieces of history. Others might have important life lessons that we can learn from in them.     You can't take a book off the shelf just because it is offensive to one person. If someone finds a book inappropiate or offensive then they don't have to read it. Another thing is, they don't just put books in the library for no reason. Although some are pretty pointless, they still have their place in our libraries. Even if a book has some profanity in it. It is still in @CAPS1 for a reason. Because @CAPS1 is something to be learned from it.      I think that all books, music, and magazines should be left alone. As i said before if someone finds it offensive then they can just stay away from it. Because all of those things are here for a reason. For example music is here for our entertainment. some music that is good to one person might be completley offensive to another. It isn't fair to the person who likes that type of music that they would just stop selling it or playing it.      @PERSON1 make a very good point when she says 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. she is saying that @CAPS1 is always going to be someone who finds a book offensive. We cant just take a book away because one person finds it inapropriate. @CAPS1 will be nothing left for any of us if we do that"	7656	7657
5318	2	"Why Books @CAPS1't be @CAPS2     Books are meant to tell stories, or give information, or even just to state someone's opinion.There are many different types of books that people might find offensive sometimes, but that @CAPS1't be a reason to take books off shelves, and here are some reasons why.     First, if you begin taking books off shelfs then everyone will too. If a person doesn't agree with the author that is understandable, but that @CAPS1't give them the right to band the book. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, everyone has the right to be offended by something they don't agree with. Everyone has a right to read whatever they want.   Secondly, if libraries begin to censor books, then this will lead to stores censoring books, and then whatever we read will be controlled. If books are taken away or controlled, then people will become ignorant and unintelligent. Books are important because they give us the freedom to think for ourselves, and to make us believe.       Third,  books are meant to inspire people and tell people information that they didn't know. Books give people the oppurtunity to travel to unrealistic places and to take us out of a certain situation. Books show us different opinions and help us figure out how to do something. Books give us the ability to think and to understand.      In conclusion, books @CAPS1't be @CAPS2 at libraries. It takes away people's freedoms. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive to people, but not to all. Books are important nad people should remeber that"	7658	7659
5319	2	"Should you be denied the right to read any book that catches your intrest? What about denied the right to listen or watch the things that entertain you, all because someone with a different opinion views them as offensive? Well, in my opinion, I feel that if my choice of entertainment was removed from books, movies, magazines, etc., it would be as if they were taking away my right to freedom as well. If you don't already feel the same as me about this topic then I am determined to, at least, make you think twice about the examples I used to support my opinion.     For starters take the old saying '@CAPS1 man's garbage is another man's treasure.' and put it into retrospect with this. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what is acceptable and was is inappropriate. For example, when I was in elementary school, I remember a classmate of mine named @CAPS2. During this time we were reading the book, '@CAPS3 @PERSON1', which called for a permission slip to be signed by parents. Of course this book was most acceptable considering it was being read to @NUM1 graders but @CAPS2's mother denied the permission and @CAPS2 was made to sit out in the hall, while the rest of the class read this amazing book. My point here is that there will always be someone who doesn't agree or approve of something you @MONTH1.     The fear of inappropriate materials getting in the hands of children is becoming a big issue. This is not a big enough issue that we should rid everything that @MONTH1 be considered inappropriate, so that they aren't placed into the wrong hands, but an issue that brings upon another. As a parent/guardian of a child, you should set boundaries that have consequences if crossed and are well known by your child. If you think a series of books are inappropriate for your son/daughter then let it be known to them. Otherwise, authors are entitled to their right of speech and should continue to write and publish a story of choice.     A library usually consists of a wide variety of different types of entertainment for your choice. Movies with cartoons to educational documentaries, as well as, books with pictures to books filled page to page with black lettering. A librarian wants to have different types of entertainment, so that it @MONTH1 bring all types of people from anywhere to enjoy. A librarian is also there to help assist you with your choice, if needed. @CAPS1 thing we should add to their job discription is making sure the right sort of entertainment leaves with the appropriate age requirements of the type of entertainment. As far as books or movies about racism to tales of the @CAPS6 go, I feel as if they should remain exactly where they can be found. Why keep such entertainment around? Do not dispose of them, they can serve for informational purposes and/or for some people whom enjoy hearing or reading about a tragedy. Either way, some topics considered offensive or inappropriate have happened in history or are still occuring today and need to be acknowledged not hidden.     Our right to speak freely, educational and entertainment purposes, and with the help of everyone, we can try and assure that unintended offense can be reduced greatly in the entertainment department. With some help of you, the people, of course, we can overcome the inpossible"	7660	7661
5320	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Should we be so pravoked as to deprive education from our children? Should we take the risk of making our future generations illeterate? Absolutley not! Well, this is exactically what happens when we remove what @MONTH1 seem to be an 'offensive' literary work from our shelves. This my fellow critics, is wrong.     I'm sure that every person can name at least one book, magazine, or song that @MONTH1 be considered 'wrong' or that displays a 'bad message'. I'm also sure that each person could come up with a book or magazine that they do not agree with as far as opinnion goes. Well, if every person went to their public library and demanded that a particular literary item be removed from the shelves, there would not be anything left for others to enjoy! Just because @PERSON1 the plummer finds a book is 'offensive' to him, does not necessarially mean that that book is 'offensive' to someone else.     Just imagine it. If every person in the world removed just one item from their public libraries and there was no material left, then what would our children do? They would have nothing to read or explore. Their minds would be as blank as the empty shelves in a bookstore. They would have nothing to help educate them. Reading a book, for instance, is a very important teaching method. It helps people and young adults to formulate opinions, relate to certain situations, develope ideas and an imagination (something very crutial to children). Just because a few people @MONTH1 not like a certain literary work, is no reason to have critics evaluate it's 'political correctness' and then remove it from our grasp.     Education is a very critical part of our growing society. Even the simple things, such as, books, magazines, and music are very richy-packed sources of knowledge. How will our youth survive if them have no means of education? How will future gerenations press on? The choice to be educated and have knowledge is the born right of every person on this planet @LOCATION1. Are you going to one who takes that away"	7662	7663
5321	2	"The choice of whether or not to censor material available to children is debatable. By taking away books and magazines due to disgusting content, parents can prevent their children from being exposed to, and possibly following this type of behavior. However, this also means that anything found remotely questionable can also be taken away from children, including great @CAPS1 novels and nearly anything concerning @CAPS2. @CAPS3 these opposing views, there is one point to trump all others, and that is free will.     While the books, magazines, and music are made readily available, the children make the concious decision to take the offensive material. If a parent disproves of the children's decisions, they have the right to take the content away from them. However, they have no right to dictate what other children are allowed to do, which is essentially what the censoring of libraries becomes. By making the content unavailable, the parents are taking away the rights of the other people who wish to read the material.      A problem addressed in Katherine Paterson's quote is a good indicator of what could happen should the censoring of libraries be performed. 'Then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS3 being an exaggeration, the image of empty book shelves in a library serves as a good image of what @MONTH1 occur if libraries censored all offensive material. While others @MONTH1 not see a book as offensive, there will always be a critic who sees the book as rude. Therefore, after filtering the material at the library so that everyone is pleased, there will be no material left to enjoy.      While people have the right to take the book, they also have the right to leave the book. If they think the content is too rude, then they do not have to read the book. Thus, while the book is available to those who wish to read it, the book does not offend the people who do not want to read it. Therefore, if the person reads the book and is offended, it is their own squeamishness that has offended them, provoked by their choice to read this book. While they can warn others about this book, the book is free to go to anyone who would like to read it, which is the beauty of libraries"	7664	7665
5322	2	"Should some libraries censor their books and magazines because people think it is offensive. @CAPS1 if somebody goes into a library to look for a book they like and it is not there.     Although some people think that offensive books, magazines or movies should be taken off of shelves, I dont because @CAPS1 if a book somebody likes goes in there and cant find it, if you are doing a report about something and they cant find the article because somebody thought it was offensive so they took it off and some people dont think it is offensive @CAPS1 if everybody thinks that a book is offensive.     @CAPS1 if someone goes into the library to find a book they like a lot and they cant find it because somebody thought it was offensive. The person who was looking for the book cant read it now and enjoy a book that they would have really liked.     In school you have to do a lot of reports and you have to do a report about a book the teacher assigned you and you have to go to the library to get that book but you cant get because someone thought it was offensive. Now they cant do the report and they have to get a zero for it.     @CAPS1 if we can take books of the shelf and everyone takes one off. then we dont have any books on the shelf to read or watch a movie. Then how does our children get to read books. If they cant get books to read then they forget how to read.     That is why I believe that we should not censor books, magazines, music and movies. If we take all that away @CAPS1 will we do with our spare time."	7666	7667
5323	2	I don't think that the movies books and other things should be removed from the shelves because at one time all of that was history. If you dont want to read the book or watch the movie then dont get it simple as that. Iit makes me mad when someone complaines about something just because they dont like well i got some thing to tell you get over it because theres a lot of things that people dont like and still have to deal with.     If theres a book on the history of black people and you dont like black peolpe then dont get it just because its there dosent mean you have to get it. Or if you think that there is something that shouldnt be said because it is wrong then dont go tell the media because that just causes more problems and makes a really big mess for every one and I don't like it when people make something small so much bigger because it not how they wanted it.     Music i only listen to one type because that what i like and i dont like listening to the other stuff that talks about smoking pot or what ever. Just because i dont smoke but for some one who does kudos to you they dont say any thing about my music I wont say any thing about yours and most of the time we listen to the music because we can relate to it I can tell you about a couple times I went out and had a fire and went around and did doughnuts in a field and some one else can tell you about when they were out getting high it all how you like it.     Movies i dont watch many except the ones that are about big trucks and what not things I like. And some people I no dont like that kind of stuff and would rather go watch some one get shot or ran over or die or some how not be ery happy.     So thats what i think about taking things off the shelces that people think are offensive just dont look at it and get on with your life not to hard to figure out	7668	7669
5324	2	"When you walk into a libary you see all kinds of books and materials you can read and look at it, but is it all approciate? Some authors have different opinions on what they want to write about and say to the readers, some of their writing is not approciate to some kids under age.     I believe there should be a way only adults can read the higher book levels, and the kids under age should only have certain books they can use. Those big tough books look so cool but can a little kid read them? No, if they even tried to read them they wouldnt be able to pronounce all the words or get an idea what they mean.      Dont get me wrong, kids do learn when they read, but somethings in these higher book levels they dont need to know about quite yet. Some books out there just have a little bit to much information a little child shouldnt be learning yet in their age. Some movies and music are also the same way, you shouldnt have your child listening to a song about smoking or getting high, because you deffinatly dont want your kid to grow up acting like that. Show a good example to everyone else and be careful what you let your children listen to, read, or watch.     When I was a little kid, I read @CAPS1. @PERSON1 books and little bear books. @CAPS1. @PERSON1 books helped me out when I was a little kid, I learned so much from him. If your looking for a book to help your kids learn without you worrying about language and what they talk about, have them read @PERSON1, he rymes his words to make it more interesting for kids to learn.      Certain materials shouldnt be out in the open for little kids to see. If a adult takes a book of the shelf then the kid takes the book of the shelf too do they have the same right? Parents and adults know alot more then a child knows or experienced, so they have a right to read what they want, but a little child shouldnt be reading that kind of material when their young. When they grow up, they can have the right to read what they choose to. The safest choice is watch what you have your kids reading and watching so they dont learn something that their not suspose to"	7670	7671
5325	2	"Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines that have offensive language or visual content, should be unavailable to children.  Songs that have bad language, books and magazine that have bad images are all over the world today.  Some parent @MONTH1 not let their children watch movies with a certain rating.     I believe that if it was okay to be published than it should be okay for anyone to read or look at. It is okay for parents to not let their children watch a movie if they think it is bad.  If the parent doesn't care then I think the person doing it has that right.  If someone goes to the library and asks that a book be taken off the shelf because it is offensive, that doesn't mean that is offensive to someone else.  There are people who can put up with a little bit of bad language; other people @MONTH1 not like it at all.  Different people have different comfort levels when it comes to censorship.     Video games have many things that fall under censorship.  How much blood?  How much language?  If you have a game with a lot of blood and the parent doesn't like it, they can take it away from the kid.  They shouldn't be able to go to a store and make them take it off the shelf and not be able to sell it.  Other people might think that it is okay to have blood in a game.       Many songs today are advertised to teenagers.  Some have bad language.  A song is somebody elses work of art.  If they say that it shouldn't be allowed that isn't fair to the artist.  Many people, writing songs is their job.  If they aren't allowed to sell their songs, they won't be able to make money.     In movies there @MONTH1 be a seen that has sexual content in it, or maybe a scene at the bar with a lot of swearing.  In this case the movies put ratings on the package telling what is in the movie.  If a parent is worried about what their child is watching then they should look at the rating before letting them watch it.       Magazines have both images and language that can offend a person.  There are many different magazines that get sold around the world.  Some @MONTH1 have bad photos in them with a caption with bad language to go along.  If you don't want to see that then you have the right to not buy it.     In some television programs, they @MONTH1 make it blurry whenever something unexpected occurs.  I think that people should censor themselves rather than have someone else censor things for them"	7672	7673
5326	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, and other items sometimes can be offensive. The individual who reads these items, I believe, will have to decided for themselves whether or not to keep them on the shelves. My veiwpoint is one that most of these items seem to portrait a message with a story, if the message is something that is right, contains a lesson, and has good morals, I believe it should stay on the shelves.      Some of these things that are opposed in today's world are books that contain history, like, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. We just finished reading this book in my @CAPS3 class. It did have some contraversial things contained in its pages, but, the history and things we needed to learn about, overcome the offensive parts of the book. This is an example of something that I believe to be ok to keep on the shelves, because it is a major part of our history.      If a book, song, movie, or magazine produced today held things that would extremely offend people, then yes, I woud believe that these things should be taken off the shelves. If an item was written just to cause a major upset amoung people, then I would not find it fitting for this item to be sold on the shelves.      After I say all of this, I do relize that things will offend people. Things have been produced that are contraversial and offensive to some. Even though this happens, I believe that we should be open to someone else's opinion on a matter, and not just our own"	7674	7675
5327	2	"I do believe that if a book is found that is offensive that it should be tooken off the shelves. I believe that they should come down because, it's inappropriate for kids under the age. Another reason why I think it should be tooken down because, their gaurdians would'nt want them reading stuff they aren't suppose to be reading, and I think people should respect that. I also think they should'nt be reading things like that because, they might come across something and the next day try to do it.   Some books, movies, magazines, etc., kids should not know about. Some talks about sex, killing, gangs, and guns. Kids might think its cool and run into some danger that @MONTH1 cause them to end up hurt or even worst, death. They should'nt be thinking about stuff like that.   Gaurdians send their kids to a libary to stay out of trouble, not go there to read about trouble. I dont think their parents would like it if they knew what their kids were reading. Other adults would'nt want their kids reading stuff their not suppose to, so they should look as other kids as if they were theirs. People should be more careful about what they sit books down at and were.   Kids walk down the street and see guys on the corner and see guns on t.v and think its cool. So when they see books about things like that their going to want to read it. They might pick up a book about sex on day and think its ok to do it because every body else is. Kids dont need to grow up to fast. That can lead to a serious illness like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and so on.   I do believe that stuff thats offensive should be tooken off the shelves. People should have more respect for kids and their parents. They should look out for kids like that because thats how gangs and crimes get started. I know people dont want to see their son out on the corner, or their daughter pregnant. Thats why I think things like that should get tooken off the shelves"	7676	7677
5328	2	"Library censorship    I do not think that the censorship of libararies is fair. The books in the library are there to be read, and the freedom of speach should protect that. I am going to explain my view below.     While there are several kinds of books that should not be allowed in libraries, who is to say that a book is offensive. The parents of children should instead of attempting to remove books from libraries; they should raise their children on better values.      Even if a book is banned, there are still people who are going to try and read the book. There have been several books that have been banned throughout the ages, and many people thought it was unfair and continued to read them. Eventually people figured out that it was unfair and they unbanned the book.     There was a time when I went to go to the main library branch of my town to check out a book on a touchy subject. I spent about three hours looking for anything on the subject and was unable to find anything. I eventually went up to the front help desk. I asked the man at the desk if he could help find the books I needed, but he told me the books had reciently been banned. I was frustrated and angered that I could not find any material on my subject and that I would have to pick a new topic.     I do not think that the censorship of libaraies is fair. The need to remove books could be avoid by teaching children better values. Even when people ban a book, there still are people who will try to get a hold of it and read it. I once needed to get a book for research on a touchy subject, only to find it was removed from the library"	7678	7679
5329	2	"Parents feel that allowing their child to roam throughout the vast rows of books and other materials in a public library is not a safe decision due to the obscene and condenscending themes portrayed in books, music, movies, and magazines. Many people have swayed opinions regarding the topic of censorship in libraries to restrict the material that many @MONTH1 find to be offensive. Censorship should be enforced amongst libraries across the country because of how easily children are influenced, the condenscending content that is portrayed throughout the pieces, and for the simple fact that the library is a public place that needs to remain appropriate and comfortable for all civilians.      Children are known to be easily impressioned by those who surround them. Parents want the best environment to place their child so they can grow up happy and healthy. Parents worry about their children, no matter the age. Children can be swayed by any information they discover and begin to want to live and act like that lifestyle they have learned about. These themes are most commonly found in the books they have read or in the songs they have heard. Books, music, magazines, and movies often times express terrible ideas because it is what the pubic demands to be entertained by. Allowing children to be introduced to these harsh themes is an obstruction to their youth. Knowing what is right from what is wrong and then basing decisions off of that statement is maturity. Kids do not fully understand what is wrong and right; therefore censorship must be enforced. Does society want the next generation of kids to grow up to become murderers or involved in gangs? Letting children grow up in a world based around the knowledge of negative influences is an irresponsible and unreasonable decision for the future of @LOCATION2's society and for the future of the child themself.     Condenscending content is the main problem with the materials that is found throughout libraries across the world. Books about gang violence, music degrading women, magazines spreading pornongraphy, and movies with murderers are not appropriate choices for the kids of the @LOCATION1 to focus their attention on. If children are allowed to read and listen to these sources, the @LOCATION1 is ultimately promoting the spread of violence for the next generation. Living in a dangerous community does not sound appealing for any human being. Embracing violence or derogitory actions for the children of @LOCATION2 is a mistake for what the future will hold.     The library is a quiet, reserved and public place that all citizens can turn to when in need to study or simply pass the time. Imagine the environment libraries would have when there is no censorship at all. If an old women sitting next to a teenager listening to a song that clearly suggests inappropriate or demeaning actions. The area that once was free for public peace and quiet would turn into a disasterous and uncomfortable place. People respect the rules and regulations of the library and would not like this area to be destroyed by harsh influences of the media.      All libraries should be forced to hold censorship among the offered media sources to ensure the quality of @LOCATION2. Having negative media influences throughout the community would be a downfall to society and cause uproars among civilians. Censorship should be pressed among libraries across the @LOCATION1 because of the easily impressionable children, the condenscending content that is displayed, and the meer fact that a library is a public place for all people, therefore it should remain appropriate and respectful towards to citizens who use it"	7680	7681
5330	2	"Some books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people @MONTH1 be a really good book to others and if you were to take them off the shelf more and more people would want to take other books off the shelf and sooner or later every book would be off the shelfs and there wouldn't be any books left to read. If you dont want to be offinded by a book then dont read it, if you start to read it and get offinded then take it back and grap a new book to read instead of taking it off of the shelf so that no one can read it.     Some schools dont even let you get magazines and they dont get offinsive books and if they do the magazines are for sports, trucks, gossip, and skateboarding. Most of the books at schools are history books and adventure but some times they do get offinsive  to some people. If you believe that your child should not read a spacific kind of book then tell him or her that they are not aloud to read that book.     So in conclusion if you agree with Katherine Paterson when she said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' then you should try to get some books taken away but if you disagree with her then you dont care what your kids read and if you half way agree with her then try to name some books that your children cant read. I do not believe that some books should be taken off the shelf but I also believe that some books need to be taken off because they are old or they just dont get read but sometimes they need to be taken off because they are offinsive."	7682	7683
5331	2	"Censorship in libraries is a definateley a neccesity. There are certain books that shouldn't be released to the public due to there lack of sensitivity. There are alot of books that are offensive to alot of social groups wether it be about there race, gender, race or social status. The language used in books @MONTH1 also be offensive to many. Even if the intentions of the writer re good the point they might be trying to get across @MONTH1 have a negative emotional impact on a reader.      There are thousands of books in libraries across the nation. Most books I've come to encounter that are morall insensative, are typically educational. Ones that try to teach you how to brush your teath, or make your bed. They are not always offensive context wise, but the images they portray @MONTH1 be racially insensative or stereotypical. Usually there is a young white mail with proper attire, and a young black male with baggy clothes and a backwards baseball cap. The message the authors and publishers are sending is that african americans are only familiar to urban culture, or even that white americans are subjected to suburban culture. Most authors would protest to this observation, but in the spongy mind of a child, they tend to pick up what they see no matter what the reason behind it.     Besides the racial issue, there are images, too explicit for children to see. Alot of childrens books these days are more violent freindly than they need to be. Pictures of severed limbs and violent acts. No child under the age of twelve should be able to look at images like that. It isn't settig a good example for kids in the regards of right and wrong. It teaches htem that doing things to hurt people is okay, and that hurting people is the right way to resolve problems. Alot of the crime children commit today isn't because of the access they have to weapons, but what they learn at a young age what they beleive is okay.          Language is the biggest problem in todays children books. Words like 'pissed' and 'damn' are used in alot of childrens books now-a-days. The result is more kids imitating what they read. Kids should not be walking around using that kind of language, but the books they read teach them its okay. Then their parents blame their friends or their teachers, which might be the problem in some cases, but the books aren,t always innocent.      Books in libraries should definateley be sensored due to their lack of sensitivity. Being sold in stores poses no problem, because the consumer has a right to purchase them, and the books should't have to be prohibited from the library. Just like a movie the book being checked out should be age appropriate for the reader. There is nothing wrong with telling someone they can't check out a book because it is not appropriate for someone of their age to be reading it"	7684	7685
5332	2	"In the old days music was use to show love to someone or just tell a story about something that you make it though. Magazines and even books are telling story ogf others that someone don't like that they are showing or telling. This days everyone put out what they want and no one care if it's someone else life. I believe if someone don't want to put in magazines or other things they have the right it take it off.      Above all, music and the other materials the world can see should be taken off the shelves of the world if it's not their lifes. There are some music that make funny of other humans, either size or color. If someone is offened to them they have a right to say to take it off. No one should make funny of other people by the way they look or are. Music have change to saying rude things to each other and how other poeple might not be good for nothing.     Also, magazines, those are they ones that make up the biggest lies of all. If they have no right to say lies or write something that someone has ask for. They also write about other people's life not someone that someone say will come out differnet in the magazines. There are a lot of humans that get dispponited with what they read and some do get offened. In other words, they should take it off the shelves away everyone that they don't think something bad about them.     Futhermore, some movies are coming out that should even been video tape. Movies are often offened to lady and man, to humans. In some place movies are taken without they people knowing that are been video taped. Until the whole world has seen it. Those are the ones that are mostly taken offensive and should be taken of the shelves from everyone to see.     In the end, music, movies, magazines, and books are not the same any more how they were in the @DATE1 they have change to wrost. Young child ate listen to music that shouldn't even listen to. Movies that shouldn't be shown to anybody that are out there in the world. If someone doesn't like that there is a story and shouldn't be out in the world that they should take if off the shelves. Futhermore, if it's offensive to so many they should take removed from everywhere."	7686	7687
5333	2	"No, I believe that, every entertainment material should have a rating on it. Therefore you @MONTH1 approve or disapprove of it as a parent.      My first reason, why I do not think @CAPS1 should remove books, music, movies, ect. Is the reason that there is some people that are mature enough to read them and take them to an enjoyable note.      Most readers that beleive they are offensive, should simply put the book down and return it. Also if there was a rating on it for offensive material, alot of readers would not pick the book up, knowing it had offensive material on it.      Now, as a personal Experience. I remember a time when a kid waved a book in my face and told me to read a line. This is a little of how the sentence went. '@CAPS2 tried to get @CAPS3 in bed with him to have sex'. Now for a sixth grader those words are (bad words). So seeing them as a sixth grader you automatically have to try to show a peer the bad words you found in a book.     But, are those words exactly offensive? To some it @MONTH1 be but to others, it would be just another word in the book. Reading books and watching movies and all of that stuff, requires a maturity level. That is the reason why I think books should have ratings. Most movies have ratings on the box and if it is rated @CAPS4 you would not let your @NUM1 old kid watch it, so why would you let your @NUM1 old kid read about mental images he/her might incounter.     My point is that, If you pull of books or movies or music from the shelves. America would have a very dull variety of entertainment to choose from. So if you have a problem with the offensive material in a book or movie or music, ect., simply find a way to rate the material before you expose it to your childeren"	7688	7689
5334	2	"How @CAPS1 you feel if you saw your kid yelling at an innocent young child? When you ask him/her where they heard that language from they reply, 'I read it from a book I checked out from the @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS1 you be all right with that? OR @CAPS1 you rebel against letting kids that young check those books out?      I @CAPS1 never want my kid to pick up a book and see the way a racist man talks to a @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and think it is all right for them to treat others the way that man did. Most books have a meaning and show ways of life. While others show how cruel the world is by talking about rape, racism, religions, cultures, and people killing each other over nothing but a loaf of bread. I know if everyone could take a book off a shelf there @CAPS1 be no more books in the world. Our kids @CAPS1 never know the stories we know, the ones we have read, and they @CAPS1 @CAPS5 be getting the high reading level they need for their age. Every parent should first understand that apart of education is learning about history, (slavery, @NUM1, @NUM2..ect.) and @CAPS5 all of it is going to be as sweet as getting roses on your birthday. Some of it is going to be nasty and bloody, but something teachers and parents should really stress to their kid(s) is that is how the world @CAPS4. Today the world is no longer like that and treating others with disrespect is @CAPS5 going to be tollerated anymore.      When you walk into a @ORGANIZATION1 they should have books that are rated like movies. If a book is @NUM3, you must atleast be thirteen to check the book out on your own, or you @MONTH1 check it out with a parent present only! If a book has a large amount of curse words and racial slurs a letter @MONTH1 be sent home, or a phone call should be made to the parent making sure it is all right for the child to check the book out. There are some books out in the world I @CAPS1 rate @CAPS6, and I feel as if you should be mature enough and old enough to read those books. Books like '@CAPS7 @CAPS8' are great for anybody through ages @NUM4 to read, it should be rated @CAPS9 because of violence, and very few cursing. '@CAPS10', '@PERSON1', and 'The @CAPS11 @CAPS12' are all children books that could be rated @CAPS13, even @CAPS14-fiction books could be rated @CAPS13 if it suits the childs reading level.      One more solution could be to @CAPS5 even put books up that are racial, abusive to other countries, religions, and cultures on the book shelves of a public @ORGANIZATION1. That @CAPS1 surely solve the problem of our children reading them, and feeling that it is right for them to do the same things the people in the book did. If you want to read a book that has any of that inside of it, I feel that you should spend your own money and go buy it. When you are done you could return the book back to that place and get your money back if you wish, you can also donate the book to '@CAPS16' or, you can keep it for yourself.     The very final thing they could do to solve this problem is to have two seperate libraries, one for adults and the other for children and teens. The @CAPS17 @ORGANIZATION1 could hold most of the books that have cursing, racism, and sbusive things. While the @CAPS18/Children @CAPS19 can have all of the other types of books, for them to read. If for some reason a book your @CAPS18 wants is inside of the @CAPS17 @ORGANIZATION1 and you allow them to get it, you @MONTH1 esscort them inside and be with them when they get the book they are wanting. When your child is old enough to drive is when they are old enough to enter the @ORGANIZATION1, as long as they have their I.D with them.      I never want my child to pick up a racial book a think it is okay to treat people wrong and with disrespect. That is why I feel these @CAPS1 be the best solutions to keep this from happening."	7690	7691
5335	2	I think that is alright the way we are right now. As we can read or listen to anything we want. It wouldnt be cool for someone to tell us the people what we cant read what we cant. I like how we can just read or listen to what ever we like.     Everyone likes how we have the freedom to read anything. The freedom to listen so anything too. I like to read books that talk bout the real real. Real as a whats going on around the world. I woulnt like someone to tell me i cant read that.     The truth is that we in the @LOCATION1. A place where theres freemdom. I just think i like the idea about we can ready or listen to anything we want.	7692	7693
5336	2	"Should students, or anyone for that matter, be allowed to take offensive books, magazines, music, etc. of library shelves? No, students should not be allowed to take books off of shelves of libraries. If people took all the books off of the shelves that they thought were 'offensive', then there would not be any books left for the rest of the reading public.      However, there should be an age restriction as to when one can start reading or listening to that material. Take '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1', whose author still remains anonymous,for example. It was published right after the author, who kept it as a diary, died and was out on store shelves everywhere. That diary was written in the @DATE1's and was mainly discussing her drug addiction. At my school library, a student or faculty member must @CAPS2 to read the book due to the graphic and offensive @ORGANIZATION1 of the published diary. The book is simply left behind the counter, waiting for those students whom are mature enough to read it. If library faculty members get many colorful emails from parents portaining to the book that their child has just read, then they should take those books and set them behind a glass case.     Say that that librarian did @CAPS1 through all of the contents in the library just to satisfy everyone. Could one even satisfy the public by sorting through all of the books and removing the 'offensive' ones from the library? No, it simply could not be done. He or she would have completely wiped the library clean of all the books, magazine, movies, etc.. Is that really fair to the public that liked or loved some of those items? No. There are times where people are going to be offended by the @ORGANIZATION1 or content of the reading material. Why should one have to censor what they read or listen to just to satisfy others if the others do not have to read or listen to it? What happens if a student, that goes into the library every week, decides to reread a book that he or she has read several times before and he or she cannot find that book? He or she would not be able to reread that book due to the fact that someone did not like the content of the material. Again, is that really fair?      Now, say that that same librarian did remove all of the books that had offensive material in them. The regular flow of people coming in to check out books are going to be devastated to learn that a book they saw in the library just the other day was removed. The more the people are disappointed about the libraries, the more they are going to gossip. They are going to discuss how the library does not have any more books, music, etc.. They are going to tell all of their friends and relatives and people that they know to not @CAPS1 to the library. Soon, people would then start to visit the library less often until hardly anybody, if any at all, would visit the library. More and more people would resort to the @CAPS3 for research and books. The @CAPS3 is far more graphic then the library, in my opinion.     Everyone was born differently. People have different tastes in clothing, music, books, movies, etc. If there someone were wearing a certain type of clothing that I found offensive, would I @CAPS1 directly to that store and take it off of the clothes racks? The chances of that happening are slim to none. I simply have no right to take away something that belongs to the public just because it simply does not comply with my feelings and/or beliefs about the appearance of that peice of clothing. Now, if I read an incredibly offensive and graphic book, would I take it off of the shelves as well? Again, the chances of that happening are slim to none. Although, I probably would mention the selected book to the librarian and see if she he or she could put that somewhere for more mature readers.      I also think that if one does not like a certain genre that @MONTH1 be offensive, then that person should not read or listen to it. Just because that person thinks that that book or @CAPS5 is offensive, does not mean that the next person will find the book or @CAPS5 offensive. That person is not being forced to read it or listen to it. There is always going to be someone that @MONTH1 have different feelings that someone else. No two people are going to agree on everything or have the same opinion on something. It just simply goes against @ORGANIZATION1.     Honestly, I do not feel that books of graphic or offensive @ORGANIZATION1 should be removed from shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think, however, that they should at least have an age restriction or be placed where more mature readers can view them. People should all learn to respect one another and their opinions. All humans are created equal and people should just learn that opinions are normal in todays society. If that means that there are going to be offensive content in @CAPS7 libraries or any other country's library, then one should just have to learn to respect that. It takes all types of people and all types of opinions and views to make the world @CAPS1 round"	7694	7695
5337	2	"Millions of people live in this free land of the @ORGANIZATION1. The government has given society the freedom to choose what they believe in or against. Almost everyone who takes advantage of voicing their opinion has a different view on certain things. My view is that public libraries should not be censored.      Libraries are a specific place for discovery, growing, and learning new information. They are full of topics some people @MONTH1 not even know existed. Information available in a library @MONTH1 include religion, politics, views on popular conflicts, money, government, races, history, and other subjects. People willing to make an effort to find information that they need or just to learn something new will find whatever they need in a library that in uncensored. If certain topics in books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to just one person and that one person is allowed to remove it from their community's library, that is no longer available for anyone else wanting to know more about that topic. As the author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     As a high school student, I write numerous reports about many different things. I have to check out multiple books from libraries to collect all the information I need. If I need a reference about a certain religion, my first thought is to head to my school library and both of my community's libraries. If I go to one of the libraries and they are censored, I @MONTH1 not get what I need because just a select few people who found that material offensive took it off of the shelf. Religion is a very touchy topic, but many people @MONTH1 just want to engross themselves about the history or facts about a different one. As a @CAPS1 myself, I understand how important religion is. Although I am not close-minded, if a book about another religion offended my beliefs, I would understand the use of it to other people that @MONTH1 not believe the exact same as I do.      As you can see, I belive that censored libraries would cause more problems than resources that could be offensive. Public libraries are to provide the people in that community, now matter what their beliefs are, with information they @MONTH1 need.  Libraries are excellent places to search for information, and people's beliefs should not affect what is available there"	7696	7697
5338	2	"Censorship of certain reading material is put into place to ensure that no one is either offended or spoken ill of.  But by not allowing access to some of these books or articles, we are denied the right and privelage to grow in our knowledge of the @CAPS1 we live in.  This can change our descisions in life and even our thought process.       Most of the, 'resticted information,' we are denied access to are books or articles that discuss or refer to events or criseses around the @CAPS1 or here locally.  This includes the history of illegal transactions with other countries, detailed autobiographies that speak about the horrors of @CAPS2 and abuse, and even rejected ideas intended to help benefit our society.  Many institutes and organizations believe that these pieces of information are too graphic in their connent and, there by, wish to have them removed from publis access.  But what they fail to realize is that what makes theses books, articles, or reports so graphic in connent is what humanity need to gain equality.     The pupose of the these reading material is to instill or insight our society on how far we have come, and the long road we still have to take.  Take for example the tragic event that occured during @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  During the @CAPS2, a mass geneocide of the @CAPS4- @CAPS5 were murderd and forced to leave their home.  If some had not written their accounts or spoke out on the hardships they endured, we would have never known how cruel humanity can truely be.  It helped serve as a reminder that we can't allow something this severe to ever occur again.  By allowing the public to see this, we have benefiited as a society towards peace and equality"	7698	7699

The question of 'Books being pulled of shelves' is a very appropriate question with everything that is happening now.     Some books are offensive some not, should the books that are offensive be pulled. I don't think so libraries should have a sytem that can monitor offensive subjects. The age of the person getting the book should be taken into consideration. They should make you be ina specific age group to be able to get some of the books,movies,magazines, and music out there.     Some of the magazines that our available @MONTH1 have @CAPS2 that isn't sutible for all age groups. But that doesn't meen they should be pulled it is up to the parents to monitor what kids read in magazines these days.     We all know that there are movies with offensive and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, but that is what the rating systems are for. That is why kind under thirteen can't rent a @NUM1 movie so that they won't be exposed to any @CAPS2 that the parents might not fing sutible for their child.     Music has a sign on the front of cd's that are not appropriate for all people. The sign says on it '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' showing that it is not for all veiwers. So with this warning sigh we should keep the music and not pull anything once again what the kids listen to falls into the responsibility of the parents.     Books are good, reading is good, and learning is good. we learn from the different variaties of literature in our libraies, so with that being said we shouldn't pull anything of the shelves because of its offensive nature."	7700	7701
5340	2	"Censorship in libraries wouldn't be a good idea, only because people have different outlooks and views on certain material. Books that are offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. There are many different book genres such as fiction, non-fiction, drama, poetry, and many others. Some books are more for adults then for children, but if libraries got rid of adult books then they would have to get rid of children's books too because that wouldn't be fair to only have books for children. Libraries are seprated into different sections for a purpose if someone finds one genre offensive they can go to a different part of the library and look for material more sutable for them.     There are many factors that play a role in what people find offensive. Culture is one of the main factors that people could find offensive. Lets say that in @LOCATION3 you only have to be sixteen to drink alochol, but in the @LOCATION1 you have to be twenty-one. People in the @LOCATION2 would probably be offended if there child was to read a book saying 'Are you sixteen? If you are come to @LOCATION3 and you can drink whatever you want'. I'm sure no parent will send their child to @LOCATION3 after seeing a book like that,but in @LOCATION3 it wouldn't be a big deal to them because of the culture they have been raised in.     Language is another factor on what could be offensive to people. If there is music in the library for adults that have bad language, children shouldn't be able to check out that type of music out. Adults can listen to the music they want and it wouldn't be right if someone came in all of a sudden and told them they can't check that music anymore because of the language it uses. To some adults muisic with bad language in it would be offensive but to some it might not be.     Lessons or teachings could also be offensive to someone if they dont agree with what someone else has to offer. When kids learn how to tie their shoes they usually do it the way their parents taught them how to. When someone else tries to teach them a different way they don't even want to try it becuse they are used to tying their shoes the way their parent showed them. In books the author might say 'a apple a day keep the doctor away', someone people might agree with that saying some people @MONTH1 not. If you all of a sudden took material that people were learning out of libraries many people would get angry because you took what they believed in out and keep material that other people believed in.     Therefore I do not think that their should be censorship in libraries just for the simple fact that  people have different views on everything. Most people have the right to choose what they think is best for them , if they want to listen to music that uses bad language they are going to, if a book seems safe for a child to read the parent will let them read it even if it's not. Everyone has their own taste in what they believe in and this a free country people will read, write, or listen to what they want. If everyone was interest in the same material the world would be perfect , but today in this soicety the world will never be anything close to perfect."	7702	7703
5341	2	"Libraries have a plethera of book in their collection. They also have movies, magazines, and sometimes newpapers. This is the general library, but what is really in the books? Should it be shown or given to a children that are six or seven?      Libraries today have books that contain, what today could be refered to as bad. They have pictures of naked women and men. In many cases this @MONTH1 be art work, but do you think that children won't have question's about it? Don't you think it could reflect a problem when possessed by hands of children, innocent children? Don't you think we should have seperate rooms or even buildings for the population that wants and is allowed to view this material.      The number and variety of movies libraries have in there possesion is growing. Libraries @MONTH1 have anything from a happy time @CAPS1 show to a movie such as the @CAPS2 that is a little less innocent. In many libraries today the only requirement for children to rent a movie is to have library card, then they can check out whatever they want. Shouldn't we have more barriers on what today's youth @MONTH1 see?      Magazines in the libraries today vary from children's magazines, to sports magazines, to magazines for womens clothing, and even advertisement for toys. Do parents really want to have to tell their kids about bras at age seven or younger? When does a parent wish to tell their kid 'no' on a 'really cool' toy they saw in the magazine down at the library. Shouldn't we have barriers on what children can see?      News, in many people's opinion, is nothing but bad news. Whether it be an earthquake in @LOCATION1 or a homicide in downtown, children can read about at the library. '@ORGANIZATION1' is what children could possibly read when they pick up the paper. Would you want to attend @ORGANIZATION1 after you heard of a fellow student being killed at @ORGANIZATION1? This can cause children to to have nightmares and not want to sleep or even leave the house.      Whether you are talking about books, magazines, or movies at the @ORGANIZATION1 libraries, your children can look at them. Wouldn't you, as a parent or adult prefer your children to be looking at age-appropriate, good news, than a horror book? As today's publications get more and more scary for children viewers,  wouldn't you like to know that your child is not reading about it and living his/her life like intended, as a child? This is how I feel about censorship in libraries"	7704	7705
5342	2	"Do you see offensive materials in your library? How does that make you feel? Most people do not like. They think that it should be taken off the shelf. I am one of those poeple.    A library is a public place . All ages ot people go there. That includes little kids. Little kids should not be around offensive things. The library should know that most of the poeple that do come into library are in their teens or younger.      Little kids pick up on everything , including words. If they see it they are more than likely to say it . I wouldnt want to a five year old going around saying bad words. Offenasive pictures are just as bad . They might see and go ask their parents what it means. After they told them they would probably tell their friends, this is the same for teens.      Teens tend to think that they are cool when the use bad words or see bad pictures. They think it is funny , and go and tell everone. Then everyone finds out and the library looks bad.     The library is a learning center and should consider the offensive things they have on there shelfs. They need to monitor the conent for all the eyes that can see it. Teens and younger kids come their to study or read books offensive things can become a destration.      So my point it that offensive materials should be removed from librarys. I think that most parents would agree with what I am saying . They are their kids and they should be aware of the offensive things they might be seeing"	7706	7707
5343	2	"There are libraries all over the world. They hav been there for years and will be there forever. Libraries contain books, magazines, movies and music all available for anyone to pick up at any given time. The question is should that child, teenager or adult be picking that up? If a person has to ask themselves if they should pick something up or not then they probably shouldn't! That's usually a good general rule of thumb.     In my opinion, things that are considered offensive should not be removed from the library. Most libraries are open to the public, not just to the students. Therefore, things should not be removed, becasuse even though students shouldn't see them, adults still can. If there are that many problems, i believe that they should have different age sections with a librarian at each section checking to make sure that person is old enough to get into the section. This should solve all problems. If you truly find something so offensive then you should find a new library, just because it's offensive to you, doesn't mean it's offensive to someone else. Consideration is another key in this whole process. Be considerate of other people's thoughts. Don't be so narrow-minded when things come offensive to you. Just look past a book that's offensive and don't pick it up.      I've seen in libraries where students will see something that they don't think is 'right' and they will tell a librarian. This to me is a sign of immaturity. If you can't handle what you see then don't read the material! Every book in the library has a bit of factual information that will help someone learn, so don't ruin it for someone else.     Let's face the facts all books are in a library for a reason. Meaning every single piece of material in that library can be used and learned from in one way or another. In conclusion, look past anything that you don't want to see because ot can be a good learning source for someone else."	7708	7709
5344	2	"Everyone has their own taste in books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe that any of those materials should be removed from shelves due to their rating. The materials in libraries should be rated for different age groups, but not taken off shelves.  Some people like violent, scary, mysterious, or even historical books, music, movies, and magazines. If they are found offensive to someone, someone else does like them. People will always have their own view point.     If a library is getting told that some of their materials are found offensive to some customers then I do not believe that it should not be rented or sold. There are books that people find offensive, but they should just not check it out. Removing it from the library just because it is offensive to yourself is a little dramatic. If you are not reading, watching, or listening to it then it will not effect you. I beleive that people should be able to express their own life style even if others find it offensive.      Removing the materials in libraries that are found offensive would only cause a larger problem. After the materials are gone, the library will probably lose customers and have a chance of being shut down. Not only that, but people @MONTH1 protest against it if it was the books, movies, music, or magazines that they find interesting or cool. It would be best to just leave the materials where they are at and ignore the ignorance of others. People have the right to read, watch, or listen to any materials that they wish.     I know people that believe the offensive materials should be removed from shelves. My parents and grandparents both agree that that there are just some materials that should not be on display. My grandparents were mad when they made the @DATE1 movie. They think that it is offensive to some poeple that do not believe @DATE1 is really the end of earth. My grandparents are religous and they found it to be offensive to their religion. I believe that weither @DATE1 is real or not, it is just a movie for interest and nothing more. People blow things out of porportion and make things a bigger issue than it really is.     I can not make a big difference as far as making this point clear to others, but it just does not seem fair to me that others should lose the geners of materials that they enjoy due to people that find it offensive. Labaries should have the option of what materials they would like to sell or rent out to people as well. I hope that you see my perspective on this issue and agree with me enough to not remove any materials found offensive to some customers"	7710	7711
5345	2	"Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I would like to write this letter to you addressing censorship in libraries. I have heard a lot of things about how libraries should not be allowed to have certain books, magazines, music @CAPS2's, and other things that are not censored. I am writing this paper to give you my perspective on how this situation should be taken care of.      I have the right to believe that if it is legal to put something with, for example, curse words or negative images inside it then it is fine to have at a public library. If someone walks inside a library and sees or hears things they don't want to then they shouldn't have picked it up in the first place. Every person has the right to look freely at what they want but also have the right not to look at it. So if you have the intention of going to a library to buy a @CAPS2 that has curse words on it then it isn't a big deal. The best way to avoid situations with people complaining would be to have signs or flyers stating what sections of the library have these things in them. I can recal a time when I was at my local library and I was waiting in line to check out a book and there was an argument between the lady in front of me and the clerk checking out the book. As I listend I heard that the lady was talking about images that were in a book that she wanted to take home to read to her children. When she tried to explain what she was upset about the clerk simply looked at her and said that they have the right to have it in their library and if it offends her then she needs to just put it back. At that moment I realized that the clerk was exactly right and that is one of the main reasons that inspired me to write you this letter. Another thing I wanted to mention is that I have actually dont some research on this subject and found out that it is perfectly fine to have uncensored items in your library as long as it has been approved.     I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I hope it has helped convince you that it is okay to have whatever in your library as long as it is legal. I look forward to going to my local library again and realizing that, hopefully, I have helped support the problems with censorship that so many librarys have. Thank you again and I hope your job only gets easier."	7712	7713
5346	2	"Libraries today have a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines. Some of these materials are good and informational, while some of these materials just don't need to be in libraries. Libraries have anywhere from the bible, to bad magazines. I believe some materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offenseive because it would bring in more costumers, won't teach kids bad things, and make the town a better place.     First, it would bring in more costumers. If these libraries get rid of the offensive materials more people would want to come to the library. No costumer wants to come to a library that is filled with offensive material. People that go to libraries go there to get good books so they can enjoy reading. If they go to the library and have to deal with all the bad material just to fine one good book, they will find another library to attend. If a person sees the library is willing to get rid of some of there mareial to make the costumers happy, I believe more people will want to attend this library.     My second reason is, the offensive material won't teach kids bad things. Many books are just not appropriate for a teenage kid. Some books talk about sex or any other inappropriate topic, and if they read about that topic it just persuades the reader to try it. Also alot of music is not appropriate for kids. Many songs today have at least one swear word in each song. I don't think any parent wants there kids listening to a song with swear words in it. Many magazines we find today have inappropriate pictures in them. It is not uncommon to flip through a magazine and see a girl half naked. I think the inappropriate materials should be removed from the shelves to keep kids from seeing and hearing these bad things.     My last reason i believe the bad material should be removed from the shelves is it would make the town a better place. If books, magazines, music, and movies are not teaching these kids the bad things they would not learn these topics as young. I believe kids first learn about inappropriate stuff through a movie or they see a picture in a magazine. If these kids don't see or hear the offensive material as fast, it would make the town they live in a better place. I believe this is true because when I was a kid our library had magazines not appropriate, and music not appropriate. It was not hard for a young curious kid to go in the library and look at bad things. I believe that's why today so many kids have babies in high school, because they learn about that stuff when there young. Bad magazines and movies only persuade teenagers more to do them things.     I beleieve offensive material should be removed from the shelves because it would bring in more costumers, won't teach kids bad things, and it would make your town a better place. Libraries today have a wide variety of materials. They have anywhere from the bible to a bad magazine. Libraries need to be considerate of others, and get rid of the offensive material that doesn't need to be on there shevles. Even if that means the library will make @MONEY1 less a month, it will only make there town a better place to be"	7714	7715
5347	2	"I belive books ,movies,music,magazines that are found offensive should be removed from the shelves. Books,movies, magazies are major part of your life. They help you study in shcool and they give you knowledge. But some of the books,movies,magazines and music we find in libraries can lead your child to a wrong path. These things can affect our daily life that you child lives in. My view to censorship in libraries are that the things that are found offensive in libraries should be taken of the sheleves so they don't affect your child.      The books that i find offensive and that i think can lead any child in to a wrong paths are books about violence,books about crimes and books drugs.They can affect your childs daily life that they live in. Some of the books that i have read in libraries have cruse word in them and the even talk about drugs. Movies nowdays show lots of bad things that a child should not see. The biggest thing i have seen in movie that i have found in libraries are nudidty and ses.They show things like sex, crimes, drugs, weapons. I think if a child sees these kind of things that can affect it views to other things in life.     Now lets talk about Magazines. Magazines show preety much the same things. They show us the things like sex and drugs and many other things that are not appropriate for your child and i thing its not appropriate for any child out there. You want your child to have good education. You wouldn't want your child to learn the things that you don't want them to. I have seen magzines in libraries that have things about sex and others stuff that won't be a suittable thing for a child.          Now lets talk about music. Music is a one thing that your child will listen to everyday. It will effect what he listens in the music and it can affect the behavior of the child and it can also lead your child into doing wrong things. Music includes profanity and many other words that you wouldn't want you kids to listen to. It also includes things about drugs and sex. Some of the music that i have listend from the libraries have taked about sex or many other things that you wouldn't want your child to listend to.          I think it is much needed for the libraries to take of book,movies,magazines,music that are found offensive. This can lead a child in to a worng path in thier lives. The books, movies,magazines,music should be educational in the libraries so they can learn the right thing and have a good life"	7716	7717
5348	2	"The books being written, and are being read everyday are nothing like they use to seem. As times are changing, so are the context of the books. More sexual, and violent behavior takes place in them. Not many people see this as an offense to children, or teenagers but I personally do. The publisher should be put to the test, testing them on rather just making a few dollars, or damaging many individuals thoughts about life. How could this change? This could change by making tougher laws against the material being printed and what is being viewed by young vulnerable minds. More attention should be paid to the what are children are reading, watching, and observing.     There are books written by a certain author, where it is about teenagers sleeping with adults, and having sexual intercourse in public places. This is something that should be looked into no only by parents, but by administrators, and school board officials. A parent shouldn't have to become tiresome, and worrisome about what their child is learning. It is good that they know, but they shouldn't be scared that they are going to learn the wrong things or things they don't approve of. Everything that I learned in school wasn't like this, your parents knew because they cared, and they were informed of what was going on in their childs life. Materials with ratings above the adult level, should be only available to juniors, and seniors in  high school. No one under that grade level should become close to that level of reading material. Children in there freshman, and sophomore years are still in the immature stage and they don't know how to become young adults.     From my observance, and my own experience I believe that removing these books from the wrong eyes and minds would benefit everyone. This method could possibly reduce teen pregnacies, and reduce the under age sexual satisfactions young minds and bodies tend to crave. Young adults read these books but they that what they are reading maybe true, and some books are very graphic. Everybook that is written, is not for everyone to read and they aren't for passing around. There are times where adults @MONTH1 read these books to younger children, and then they become hooked and want to read more, and bring one of those books to reality. This is not a joke. Certain material observed by the human mind, can cause a problem. It can make you feel as if the book is about you, and the outcome of the book is the outcome of your situation.     All material isn't terrible material. Although certain material that includes sexual behaviors, and violence, and criminal mischief can cause harm to the persons everyday ability to function. They will look to the book as to how should I solve the problem, and will I get in trouble. The answer is yes you could get in trouble and yes you can be punished. Nothing, is worth losing a future over, especially a book that made money off of you. I read certain books because they depict the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 community and the surrounding that we live through every living, and breathing day. I am digusted at how some of those books speak about how @CAPS1 @CAPS2 women throw themselves at men (animals), for attention. I know this isn't true, and I wish that it would stop.     The harsh material printed is something that should raise many eyebrows, because it is something terrible to read and believe. I wouldn't want my children to become apart of that type of society. I believe it is garbage, that shouldn't be printed. Whether it is real, or fake, I still do not like it. I object the material that is out there, but I cannot stop the maddness alone. I would need all the help I can possibly get from any adult willing."	7718	7719
5349	2	"It wouldn't be right to censor a library on beliefs or what one person thinks is right. If @PERSON1 prefers books on animals and hates books on cars, and @PERSON2 prefers books of cars over books on animals.     And the @PERSON2 can censor the library. then @PERSON1 wouldn't like his library, and lets say this is the only library for twenty miles and she has to go to this library. It won't have what books she wants because @PERSON2 is in charge of the library.      Suppose in that same library @PERSON2 doesn't like rap music, but @CAPS1 does. So, @PERSON2 removes any rap cd's from the library. Just because @PERSON2 doesn't like rap or books on animals @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 suffer the loss.     Now @PERSON2 has censored movies and magazines also. Which doesn' make @PERSON4 happy or @PERSON3. @PERSON3 wanted to read a nice magazine about all the gossip on the actors and actresses; and @PERSON4 wanted a scary movie to watch with his friends, but @PERSON2 hates scary movies and gossip magazines. So you won't find any of those movies or magazines in his library.     Now he has effected more and more people.

5351	2	"What is considered offensive material? We all have read material that @MONTH1 have been offensive to some people but, that isn't a good enough reason to take books off of shelves. If we had taken books, movies, magazines, and music off the shelves because they were offensive to other people then what would we listen to or what would we read. At the off hand that a book is really offensive, why have it or get it in that matter.     The only reason that people take things like books, movies, and cd's offensively is because they were taught to take those things badly. As an example say that a indian boy goes into a book store and gets  book on how indians were treated in the past that affect them today, he would go home and read the book, the next day come back mad because of the things said or listed in the book. Well it couldn't be taken offensively because he or she should have asked or done a little prereading to see either what it would say or listed. Also things like music can't be taken down unless they have say a hateful message or hate because of race.     Many people nowadays use language that they dont think is offensive to other people but they do and they'll deny it so that it looks like they didn't say it but, that way they can uphold the image of looking like a good person and go on to voice their opinons  when they do the very same thing. But if people want these things taken off the shelves then they should have a good reason for it. Many books, movies, and cd's have been taken off shelves because they think this thing they're watching,  reading, or listening to is bad but most of the time the reason is because they don't take the time to understand or listen to what the book, or movie, and magazine are trying to say.           So next time when you pick up a book or cd and even a magazine or movie just remember try to either take the time to understand it or just skim through it to see if it's worth your time or not. But, please dont just take a book off the shelf just because you think it's offensive try to maybe ask for what the item is trying to opinonate to you or you could ask a person what some of the language means or what its trying to say."	7724	7725
5352	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, magazines, music, movies, ect., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?      I do not believe that you should have to remove these materials from the shelves of the library. But as a library and respecting people there should be an adult section of those books that are 'offensive.' If the problem has to do with cursing thats not too bad, but sexual content is not right to have in a library where there are children. As a child you are goin to see and hear things that are inappropriate everywhere you go there is no stopping that. But as a parent you should be censoring what your child is obtaining in their daily lives.     Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean everyone else will also. If there are books, magazines, movies, or music or maybe just something on the internet that has to do with cursing you should not get upset over it. Yes, they could have used different words to describe things but, they didn`t so that is something that people will have to deal with it. Reading curse words is no different then spaking them or even hearing them. Obviously the author wanted it like that, some people like things better if it does have cursing or other inappropriate material in them. That is how some authors make their money.     If materials in the library are full of sexual content yes, I do believe that the material should be removed from the shelves as asked from the citizen. Citizens should have some rights to what they do or do not want in the public library where there maybe young children. If the library feels they need to keep these materials then they should open an adult section only. That would keep everybody happy. The young children would not be in content with this material.     I have read a few books in the past that I was not happy with myself, it contained some very descripted sexual material in it. I got that book from our middle school library, that was very inappropriate I thought. Young adults ages @NUM1 should not be reading about that. I took it to the attenion of the librarian that this book was very descriptive of this content and she didn`t even know that this book was like that she was  concerned about how many middle schoolers had already read that book and did not tell her about it. She continued to apologize about how upset my mother had been.     Librarians should be aware of the material that is being destributed out from the library. They should be observing the books. When the books are returned they should ask what they did and did not like about the book. They should be curtious to the suggestions that people have about the censorship in the library.     Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves at the library. I have told you what I thought about the cursing and sexual content of the books in our libraries. I have given an example of a time when I had read a book that should have been censor proof first, and about the option to have an adult section at the library. That is my thought about the censorship in the libraries"	7726	7727
5353	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1:     Censorship comes in many varies. I believe that censorship is good to a certain extent. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries because @CAPS2 take offense to them. I believe that there should be rules for the material, such as porngraphy.     In our local library, there are movies there that are rated @NUM1, should those be taking out because ten-year-old kids use the library? I do not believe so. Libraries should have rules stating that you have to be a certain age or have a parent there to say yes or no to get that certain material or not. In some libraries, they have graphic magazines, but you have to be a certain age to beable to see them.     If we, the @CAPS2, took books off the shelf because @CAPS2 took offense to them, then our book shelfs would be bare. Someone is always offened by something.     One thing, we as @CAPS1 censor out on television and as employes at a work place is saying '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2.' @CAPS2 take offensive to '@ORGANIZATION2' because it has to do with @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When you are leaving a store around the @CAPS6, the workers there will say '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' not '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2.' As a religious person, I'm offened that @CAPS2 are offened by it. We have immagrates that come into the @LOCATION1 and try to change things because they are offened by it. I personally think if they do not like it, then go back to where you came from. Also on the radio, the radio stations do not play certain songs because the language the artist uses can offened someone. When someone gets offened by something that is said on the radio or television, they are always ready to sue someone for it. One thing I believe @CAPS2 forget is that we do have a freedom or speech, but it seems if you use it, they are going to get into trouble.     In conclusion, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned because @CAPS2 take offense to them. If you do not like what the author is putting out to the world to see, then do not look."	7728	7729
5354	2	"Libraries can be found almost anywhere in the @LOCATION1 and they can have some material not suitable for children. So I think there should be a censorship in libraries because children shouldn't see adult material in magazines and movies, children shouldn't hear curse words in music or movies, and children shouldn't see or hear rascist slurs.    Children should not be able to get movies or magazines that are rated @CAPS1 or have a parental advisory sticker on them from a library. Libraries should make that child have their parent come to the librarian and say that they don't mind their child watching or reading this material. They should also make the parent sign his or her signature to show they don't mind and show the librarian some I.D. just to make sure.     Children should not be able to get music if it has a parental advisory sticker on it. That music probably has explicit material in it like cursing and rascist slurs. The library should have his or her parent go to the librarian and say they don't mind their child having this and have them sign their signature and show some I.D. to make sure they are that child's parent.      So in conclusion libraries should have a censorship because children should not see adult material in magazines or movies, hear curse words in music or movies, or see or hear rascist slurs."	7730	7731
5355	2	"I strongly believe that @CAPS2 should not be censorship of books, movies, or magazines,etc. @CAPS2 has been many readings people do not feel is not something to have in @CAPS2 libraries. This is @CAPS1! Remember freedom of expression, and tolerance? People's words count and they have they right to express how they feel or think in literature, no matter how they express it in the writing or films.    Religion and belief systems are very hard to debate when it comes to censorship. For, example if @CAPS2 is a homosexual children's book in a library, a religious person might feel uncomfortable with this as he/or she might feel that this book is unacceptable to have in the library, though I believe tolerance is a big role in the solution. If, you do not feel that is not a readable for your children, this is also solved by sectioning. I understand it is something you might be do not agree with, but @CAPS2 are other people who do agree.     Now, when it comes to inappropriate things and children, they are magazines and movies that should be exposed to children's eyes. They are influenced by the media and everday things. I think this is an easy problem to solve by just putting the things that are 'adult material' in a section where kids are not allowed to go to.       Here is my main idea: @CAPS2 should be no censoring, but sorting. @CAPS2 should be more acceptance of readings for they have a reight to express @CAPS2 writinngs. People's words count and they have a right to express it."	7732	7733
5356	2	"I think that some books should be removed from the shelves, because some books have racism in them. racism books need to be removed from all shelves across the world. I also think books that are found offensive should be removed from shelves too.      I feel that most books should stay on the shelves. Most books don't even contain offensive writing in them. I also feel that the books with racism in them should be removed because those books will not grab a persons intrest. Most magizenes, however, are found offensive and they need to be removed.      I have not found a book, music, and movie offensive. I never once stood in a library and read a book that had offensive material in it. However, I have read a book that had racsim in it and i put the book as soon as the racism started. I feel that everyone has the right to remove the offensive and racist books from the shelves and it is our right to do it.      There are some pople that like offensive books, and feel strongly that they should not be removed from shelves. My argument twords that is if you ever read anything that was offensive twords your religion or ethnicity you would feel the same way as I do.  Some poeple might also say that those books have real quality information in them. Well they or you cand rewrite the book without using offensive or racism in it.     In conclusion books with racism in it should be removed from the shelves. Books that are found offensive should be removed from shelves too. I believe that those books that have racism in it are causing people not to read books. It is our right to remove racist books from the shelves weather you do it or not is up to you. There will be books left over for our next generation to read. Every book doesn't have racism."	7734	7735
5357	2	"I beleive that there should be an extent of negativity to what children read in books, or any form of literature in general. I think that only a slight use of language should be available and even so, only if it is absolutley required. I also suggest that a limited amount of violence should be used and if not, it should atleast have little or no severe graphic content.     Like most people, i know that that more grapgical and violent literatures should only be accesable by those who meet required characteristics. Characteristics including age, sensitivity, and a mature mind structure, or atleast if they have the appropriate concent of an adult or elder gaurdian"	7736	7737
5358	2	"Most people think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., Should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. In most cases everyone have there own oppinion about. Some think we should and some think we should not. But in reality there are somethings you can not controll. What people write, and make movies on is somthing we can not controll. Even if are children do or dnt see @CAPS1 is there choice.     I think that books, music, or magazines should not be removed from the shelf. In the real world there are good things that happen, and there are bad things. Therefor the good and bad things that happen we cant controll. Most parents will try to keep there kids from looking at the offensive or negative things that happens in life but they cant. Children need to see offensive things in life so that they can learn from @CAPS1. They can eaither be like them, or choose not to be.     Little do the parents know is that you exsperiance alot of offensive things. And @CAPS1 does not just come from books, movies, or magazines. @CAPS1 comes from people. People have a right to do or say whatever they want. Without there parent or someone being there. Its more offensive things out there besides books, movies, and magazines. @CAPS1 can be anything like t.v , or bad people that do bad things. Its just things that we can not controll.     Even I have seen and herd bad things. Even tho my mom tryed her hardest not to let me see thoes things. @CAPS1 happend anyway, with or without my mom being there. @CAPS1 just didnt come form books, music, movies, or magazines. @CAPS1 came alot from my friends other people that deside to do the bad and offensive things. Belive @CAPS1 or not its life. Everything and everyone is not perfect.     Most people think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., Should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. But i dont, @CAPS1 really would not make a difference. Everything is not good. There will be bad aand offensive things that will happen. @CAPS1 is just life. Everyone will have to go through @CAPS1 no matter what. Because there are bad people and then there are good people. You have the choice to be a good or a bad person. Depending on how you want to be. The only person you can controll is you."	7738	7739
5359	2	"Have you ever taken the time out to think about offensive things that could be displayed in our own libraries? If you actually went out your way to notice some of the things showed you would probaly be shocked. Everything that is written, photo shot, or maybe in  movies are not always good. Some things are just left better unsaid rather than being out in the open.     First, everything that are in books aren't always true. Some people write fictional or even nonfictional books which mean they could be true or they be just an imagination. Most books are for older people which means it takes a little  more maturity than others. With that being said younger children that are advanced shouldnt be reading things that are for teenageers/adults. Some of those books should be tooken off the shelves.     Second, magazines arent always the best idea for younger people to look at. Most children like looking at photographs. Every picture in an magazine is not an appropriate picture. There are pictures in magazines such as models with half of their clothes on or even nude! That whouldnt be a pleasant image to display to ah child or minor. Things such as that should not be out everywhere.     Finally, movies are not always the best thing to look at from time to time. Some things in movies are just not appropriate at all. For example there are movies in which they display drug use, gang relation, and violence. Those type of scenes should never be displayed on a screen! Its very offensive on so many different levels the public shouldnt support such things. They should remove all wrong.     In conclusion, I have told you some of the items that I believe should be removed off the shelves at our personal libraries. Libraries shouldn't be a place where you come to see things that offends you. It should be ah place where you come to gain knowledge and learn new things. Just remember that every new discovery isn't always right."	7740	7741
5360	2	"'@CAPS1.. dont read that book !' is what some teachers @MONTH1 say to a book in the @ORGANIZATION2. Censorship is one of the keys things teachers and parents try to make us do. '@CAPS2 judge a book by its cover' is what i say.      I feel that if the book was published, then why not read it? I know some books are just too 'nasty' as my mom says. But why protect me from reading it if it's on the shelf. Many people write books based on everyday life. Face the fact we are living in a world now days where children know too much as it is.       I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and found a book called, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 A @CAPS6 @CAPS7' because I know that in my neighborhood there are many 'thugs' it caught my attention. Some of my teachers questioned me as to why I am reading a book like that. All I could say was, 'I know what thugs do.' I live on what people call the 'north end' and all I see is thugs slanging.      I say @CAPS2 judge a book by its cover because @CAPS2 judge a person by the way the look, talk, dress, ect. Just like in @CAPS3 person there is a unqiue pesonality; in @CAPS3 book there is a purpose for that book. If censorship is so important then why even let an author publish the book.      @CAPS3 time I read a book I try to relate it to everyday life and even present day life.@CAPS1 looking at the negative in everything and look at the postive effects. Some books speak truthfulness that it @MONTH1 change the way a person looks at life. So @CAPS2 judge a book by its cover, just like @CAPS2 judge a human by their outer appearance"	7742	7743
5361	2	"Should there be censorship in libraries? This would have to be a mixed answer, with  a little bit of both sides. There are some things that shouldn't be in a library, while at the same time even if something is offensive is it truly offensive or is it just offensive to someone people? And is there another option to this complex equation?     There should not be censorship in libraries. Libraries are places where different types of information are collected and put out for everyone to learn from. But there should be a place to put offensive material so that if a person is offended by something it can go in a place that they won't have to look in.      What constitutes the term 'offensive'? Well offensive material is material that conflicts with someone moral guidelines. So with that in mind every item inside a library is offensive to at least one person. What if there was someone who found children's books offensive, would we have to remove all children's books from libraries?     But at the same time there are things that should not be on display for everyone to see. Not because they are offensive but are not suitable for everyone. Pornagraphy would be a prime example, it shouldn't be banned from libraries but just put somewhere where children can't get a hold of it.     So when the question of censorship in libraries comes up you have to take all of the different angles in to mind. One cannot simply remove something because it is offensive to some people, because that would be taking away the freedom of speech from the person who wrote it and you should never infringe upon someone's freedoms."	7744	7745
5362	2	"I think that books , music , magazines , and movies that deal with sex and voilence should be removed off the shelf in public libraries . I feel that if youg children dont have the opportunity to read , hear , or see things like this then they wouldnt do most of the things they do . Children often do what they see thier older piers do and @CAPS1 thier older piers dont lead by an good example . Dureing this time most of the things that we see on tv is an bad example for kids . Instead of looking and listening to things that will better them in the furture they often do the oppisite . A couple of times i have went to local libraries , looked on the shelves , and saw things that should not be there . Libraries should have a section that is for kids and a section that is for more older teens or adults ."	7746	7747
5363	2	"Can you really take materials off shelves at the library just because someone does not like them? I believe that certain materials on the shelves at a library @MONTH1 not be appealing to everyone but you cannot just take everything off the shelves so your left with nothing.     I beleive that if someone comes into a library and wants books, movies, cds, or magazines removed just because they do not like it and do not have a good reason. Then that item should not be removed. If someone comes in and wants it removed for a particular reason that could be an exception. An exception to that rule would be if it hasd nudeity or extreme fowel language.      Another way that they could suit both people who do not want the item removed based on the ones who do is they could seperate the items with fowel language and nudity in to a seperate area or room. You could only enter that room if you were eighteen or older, if you had a signed note from a parent on file, or if you had a parent with you.      There are many reasones why I beleive the way I do. One of them is because of an experience I had. It was when I was about in eighth grade and they had an  @CAPS1 rated movie playing at a book store and kids came in the store. Somebody came in and thought i t was not right for little kids to have rated @CAPS1 movies playing in stores or librarys where kids are. So the person spoke up and due to the fact of her speaking up she got rated @CAPS1 movies removed from being played in that particular store.     I beleive that you can take materials off the shelves but there needs to be some kind of reasonable reason. If someone comes in and wants it removed  just because it was dumb or they did not like it I would say no"	7748	7749
5364	2	"I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be taken off the shelves because....say if books has some negative things in them like naked pictures or something like that, you wouldn't want your child to read that, because what if one day your kid is at school all day, he/she comes home and says 'mom or dad, guess what, today saw this and that in this book and it looked cool' (naked pic's) you would want to take the books off the shelves quick.     Another reason I believe that certain things should be             taken off the shelves is because,...if your @NUM1 year old                    son/daughter was to listen to music that has cuss words               in it and then one day he/she is walking up and down                  the street saying every last cussword that's in that one                 song. (you know you are going to wasnt to take that off              the shelves).      The last reason I believe that these things should be                taken off the shelves is because say if your kid wants to watch a movie one day and they can't because the movie has bad things in it, or the movie is just straight up nasty and he/she can't watch the movie, then you are going to have to deal with all that hollering everytime they can't see a movie.          These are all my reason's why I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be taken off the shelve"	7750	7751
5365	2	"When in the library some people wonder through the rows scanning for a book that will attract their interests. However, some books @MONTH1 that @MONTH1 be displayed are inappropriate and unsastainable for anyone, even most adults. Society has become a custom to letting these types of books fill our shelves and letting the information stored inside educate our children of many nations. Although, as humans we should have the right to say no to this shouldn't we? Of course, that's why they should be taken off the shelves and bannded from public access.     First of all, children in our world have  become to well knowleged at such a young age. Who said that this information is needed for @CAPS1 to function? If society could look back into the past and discover that the children of that time were just as knowlegable as they are now then maybe they wouldn't publish as many horrible books for the younger generations.     Sit back and think for a moment, how many children have learned so much at an early age, and then become uninterested in learning as the reach school age? Too many, if we cut out all this inappropriate nonsense in early childhood our children would be smarter and more conscious about their actions and studies in their later years. These books displayed are far too common, and easily accesessed to young children, which is why they should be banned from all public libraries.     If a book is offensive to a child they @MONTH1 also loose interest in reading all together. This is also why many young people have given up reading and gone to movies and the internet. If these books could be taken off the shelves of the libraries the literacy rate would for sure, sky rocket and reach a boiling point. Reading cannot be let go, we have to come up with a way to inhance the reading in the school systems to better society.      In conclusion, reading such detailed information can scar a young childs mind for the rest of the years to come. This statement is indeed true, many kids these days have been sabotaged at an early age to learn what they do not want to. Although, this can be stopped, and should be stopped. Every person on this planet should contribute to make an effort to stop the publishing of these books published for young children. For this can only cause future grief and make a child someone different from whom they're supposed to be. Remember this, every child, cannot be a happy child, if they are learning information, that is not fit for their mind"	7752	7753
5366	2	"Do you beleive that some items in the libaraies are offensive, why? In my perspective, I think that books, music, movies, magzines, and other intertaining things should not be removed from the library because it might be useful to someone.          The most important thing that you should do is leave the books, or even a movie that might be offensive on the selves so that someone, like an adult or teenager could be able to find it. Some thing that might be offensive to a child, might be apporpiate for adults. People should be able to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. Parent of younger student should make a dicision of what there child should read.     So if you find some thing that is offensive to someone like a little kid, or even your son, or your daughter just take action and be a responsible parent. Do not like ur children check out books that are offensive. A child should not read teenage books like 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' and even ' The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' because in theses storys  have violence and killing.     In @CAPS6, keep offensive things away from your children,but dont take it off the selves. People should be allowed  to choose what they want to read. It important because parent need to watch what there child watch, or even what they read."	7754	7755
5367	2	"Taking books of the shelves just because they are offensive to some people? Absolutley not, i think that all books should be on the shelves for everyone to use even if some are offensive. If people who think that some books are offensive and think that the books should be removed from the shelves then they can pick diffrent books to read. They do not have to read the same books as everyone else.     For example if there is a book about drugs and how to use them and a strict parent would not like for there kid to be learning and reading about it then i reccomend to the library that they need to have a talk with the librarien or go check out and supervise them while they get a book that is acceptable. But as for the people who just dont think its appropriate for books that have drugs, sex, or violence in them then they just need to ignore it and let others read them if they would like to. Really where would are world be at if we had everyone take books off the shelves that they thought were offensive to them? We would honestly have nothing to read.     Some people think that drugs and violence are offensive and are wrong but also there are people who feel like religion should not be put in librarys too. We all have our own opinions about what we feel is right but i think that we should all be able to read and learn about whatever we would like in the public place.     Parents do need to be strict on there kids and watch what there learning about and listening to because it can have a bad effect in the future. You have the right to let your kid choose to what he/she wants to listen, read, or watch. So go with your child and check out a decent book that you approve of but leave those alone who would like to read a book or who would like to listen to a cd that they find enjoyable.       So no i do not think it is acceptable or should be allowed for people to take books of the shelves. Everyone should have to right to read what they would like to read. If you are at an age to make your own decisions about what you would like to learn about then you defiently should have the right to do so."	7756	7757
5368	2	"I believe personally that books should not be bannded form schools and from @CAPS11. Every book has a cover with a story to tell, and when @CAPS11 pick up that book they see the story that is being told which sometimes can effect how they see things in life. Books gives @CAPS11 and readers different thoughts and views on life and on theirs as well. If I was a reader looking for something to cheer me up if there was never anything else important to do I would always read. before going to bed children would always ask for there mother or father to read them a bed time story before they went to bed because it would make them happy inside and would give them a story to think about while drifting off to sleep.     In my childhood books always played a major role in my house. Every morning I would wake up and my dad would always be sitting there at the table drinking coffee and reading the daily newspaper while my mom would sit on the other side reading some of her favorite books. At school I would sometimes go to the lirary and pick out a nice book to read like @PERSON1's @CAPS1 or The @CAPS2, and would read those books for a while until it was time for my next class. There are some books out there that tell the stories and the lives people had that would give us a better view of things that have happened in the past. If there are books that people dont like and want removed why not just never read that book if you dont like it.     If I was a little @CAPS6 looking for a book that dealt with the holocaust, and some one didn't like the book because it had to deal about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 then why go and pick it up if you know your not going to like it. There are @CAPS11 and @CAPS13 out there like me that want to learn about the history so that we can better understand the past and the present. From reading books like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and other @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 books I have learned that people died because one man that had the power to remove a race did not like them because of things he exspected they did. If you think about it people are removing books because the expect it has something that is unappropriate in its pages but you wont know until you pick it up and find out for yourself. There are books out there that do have unappropriate things but they also have a story to tell that can maybe explain why there is a unappropriate event that happened and that what was the cause.     I have read books that have showed me pictures of event that happened that led up to the ending. A example of a book would be @ORGANIZATION1 which revealed to me the things she had to do to survive the holocaust and the people and friends she lost that were closes to her. I understand that some people dont want their @CAPS11 to learn about the events that have taken plase and the history yet. Instead of removing the books from everyone to read why not put a tag or a sticker that has a age level from @CAPS10, to @CAPS11, then to @CAPS12 and finally @CAPS13. With this it would be a lot easier and finding the best way to solve this problem and would make everyone happy.     When I go to public library's I see @CAPS11 and @CAPS13 learning and having the joy to find out the history and events that took place. I would want every child and adult realize that through reading we can better understand the things life throws at us and the ways to handle these problems. I would want everyone to find a book that would tell a great story and would show them the things they want to see and hear about. every book @MONTH1 have a cover but under that cover it has a story to tell.

When people see some magazines or books and they're from a different country they might think that theyre thought bad of. While most people dont think of this and have no idea this is thought to be a common misunderstanding among our various people. I think that some @CAPS1 of books and movies should be censored if this will create this mood and misenterprets.     In this understanding since in various countries like @CAPS2 or @LOCATION1 they have very different beliefs and if they came to our country and seen what and how our reading and movie matierials are they will be appalled at what we love in our country. There might be a movie about how various leaders from @CAPS2 were killed and an @CAPS2 person will be extremely offended if they saw this and by this and start to hate out country as well as our people.     One day at the movie store I went with my brother and we seen a @CAPS5 woman looking at various books and movies around and she was very offended and emotional at the things she was seeing. So in most places things should be limited, but if an @CAPS6 wanted a movie they could just ask the store clerk for that certain title so people wouldnt be affected like this.     Everyone has different appeals against something they read or watch, it can be emotional, ethical or many other things. Another reason some things should be censored or removed from shelves are; if a child had wandered away from his mother and went to an different section of the library and seen an mature book and the title as well the child @MONTH1 get a different perspective like hey I should read this it looks interesting with a cool title, but not if its for mature audiences so most things should be most of the time tooken of the shelves.     Another reason is that you have to know what section of the library you're going to. Or you @MONTH1 get lost and end up seeing something you didn't want to. Another time I was at the library I went into the adult section with my sister and seen some very inapropriate @CAPS1 they were way higher up than teens and children books. Adults read more complex books with lots of emotions.      People everyday see books or movies and etc that they don't or would not like to see. The only proper solution is to take those things off the shelves. What can you do to help? You can always mention to the library owner that you've seen some things and you recommend them taking it off or just mention some suggestions. Only people can help this since if the other people from various countries  respect others and we want to respect their emotions and beliefs it's only natural to do this"	7760	7761

Everyone will find something offensive that you might not find it as that way. Some people might be more strong about it, while others, it doesn't bug them as much even.     There are many offensive things,such as bad language, rude comments, maybe racism made in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that people, in general, are not interested in viewing. This kind of media is found everywhere throughout the world. So there is no possible way to avoid all of it. Authors, directors, famous artists, and magazine writers have to keep making and writing new things to keep the fans enthused.     If someone has to read a certain book for a report at school, then they have to read what they don't want to.  Every school library has at least some books that students take home that parents aren't very happy in them bringing home. Younger kids might even bring a book home that has offensive language or participating in words talking about violence and that will have influence on them.     Not every bit of media is bad. It's good to have media because it keeps people entertained and something to view or listen to when they are bored. It is used everywhere and pretty much anything has to do with music, books, nagazines, etc.     Everywhere around you, at school, libraries, bookstores, maybe at home, there will be a book, movie, magazine, or music, you will find offensive in some way. Some people enjoy the way things sound, or what they view. Not everyone gets offended like others, but people have different views about things. Media is what keeps people going"	7762	7763
5371	2	"Do I think Book's that have offensive itams in them? I don't think so! When stuff is offensive that gives use a the indication. About the music, movies, magazines, and exetera. That's also gives use are colcher.     In most cases offensive litcher in books sometimes @CAPS1 give use the time peryed of the day. Like hucku berry phin. music is also a factor @CAPS1 gives us the colcher of the eara. @CAPS1 keep us from makeing the same mistakes we made in the past. That's most of the reasons of keeping these thanges.     There's a lot that me need about offensive thangs. Form telling are history to telling are colcher. Thats why offensiive litcher is good for us."	7764	7765
5372	2	"Magazines, movies, music, and books that are found in the library @MONTH1 be offensive to some people and @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Some parents @MONTH1 want to have their children learn about @CAPS1's at a younger age. While other parents @MONTH1 think the library should be shutdown for having more mature books on display for all of the public eyes to gaze down upon. Therefore, the argument about what is right and what is wrong to have on the public library shelfs occurs.     When my father and I go to the library the topic about what is right or what is wrong never occurs. @PERSON1 (my father) has respect for buisnesses, a public library being one of those buisnesses, and there judgement on what type of books to put out and what books not to put out on the shelves. @PERSON1 also knows that I have enough common sense to not ask for a more mature book, and go to a section of the library that I know i'll will find a book that suits my age and my level of maturity.     On the other hand, if I go to the library with my mother and theres even the slightest smell of a foul book she'll flip out. One time while my mother and I were going to the library to get books about the ocean and native animals to @LOCATION1. We happened to pass by a section of books that showed male and female body parts, and described how child birth occurs from mating to the actual birth. Thats when she yelled for the head librarian. When the head librarian got there my mother started yelling and fliping out to a never ending extent. Then started asking all these quetions about why the book was on the shelf, and why could the children be able to view those types of books. Eventually, I had my mother call my dad to come pick the two of us up and explain to him why we were leaving @NUM1 minutes earlier than planned.     Magazines, movies, music, and books that are found in the library that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people and @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. As in the above storys I told you about my father and my mother having different outlooks on whats in the library. My father knowing that I have the intelect to know what to grab and what not to grab. On the other hand my mother yelling about books that the library had there for informational purposes. So many people, even people that are married have different outlooks on what society should and shouldn't have on the shelfs at our libraries."	7766	7767
5373	2	"It is my opinion that content in libraries should not be censored. If content in libraries is censored children are missing out on the timeless classics that have touched so many lives. Also, if books are censored, or taken out of the library altogether those books are now not there for anyone to enjoy. Plus there are already childrens sections in place in most libraries.     If content in libraries is censored the children would be missing out on the classics that touched our lives. Lets say the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' is removed from a library because of it's content. Now, that book has lasted through the years to be one of the most influential books of all time. It teaches us a story of a young girl growing up in a time were prejudice was normal, and the world was seen in black and white. That book, that has touched and inspired so many people is now gone and your children can't enjoy it. Would you want your children to miss out on a timeless classic?     If a library were to remove a book from there shelves, then no one can enjoy it. If taking a book off the library shelves saves a child from reading inappropriate content for their age level how does it affect older generations? A librarian might take a book off of the shelves because they believe it to be inappropriate for youg children. However the next person comes in in their mid @NUM1 to @NUM2 and might ask the librarian for help finding this book they want to check out. The librarian then tells the person that the particular book they are looking for is no longer there do to inappropriate content for children. The person then has to find a new book to read, perhaps not even get a book. Would you want everyone else to suffer on the chanc a child might get hold of an inappropriate book?     Putting aside all other relevant facts and information most libraries these days have childrens sections in them. A childrens section is designed to keep children in a reading area that is comfortable to them and to their parents. If a child is old enough to pick up a book outside of a childrens section, and understand its contents then that person should be penalized. A child that walks out of the childrens area picks up a book and reads it, but doesn't understand its content should not be penalized however. The child that walks out of the childrens section and can understand the book most likely has the sense they should not be reading that book. The child that leaves the childrens section picks up a book, and reads it without understanding doesn't know bettern however.     Content in libraries should not be censored. It takes away the meaning of timeless classics from the reader. If the books were to be taken out altogether than no one can enjoy reading it. Childrens sections in libraries are in place to protect small children from reading inappropriate books. If we as a nation continue to censor the books we have then one day we won't have any."	7768	7769
5374	2	"Libraries have been open to the public for years, and are filled with vast arrays of media to help grow ones knowledge. There is a comfort in knowing that if one wanted to find a particular book or other material that they could simply go and check one out from the local library. But what if that freedom was stripped away? What if, due to censorship in libraries, one couldn't check whatever they wanted out? Censorship in libraries conflicts with the freedom of people and should not be applied.     One reason why censorship should not be used in libraries is that it limits the knowledge and understanding of a person. It is agreeable that certain material is unsuitable for some people, but if the person is just wanting to gain understanding about something it should be allowed of him or her. Everyone has a right to an education, and the library is a perfect place to gain one. But by using censorship it puts limits on what a person can or can't learn, which is wrong.     Secondly, censorship conflicts with the freedom of people in the problem that arises with it. What makes a book alright for the public and what makes it explicit? Everyone has different views about what is morally acceptable and unacceptable. For instance, if I thought one book or movie wasn't suitable for an audience but '@PERSON2' was alright, someone else might think what I thought was wrong was right and '@PERSON2 @CAPS1' wasn't. Just as Katherine Paterson was trying to convey to her readers, if everyone could censor whatever they thought wasn't suitable than there would be nothing left for anyone to read.      Another reason why censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that even implemented there, a person could still go and find whatever they are looking for at a bookstore or online. Just as in @LOCATION1's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', where people were conditioned to hate books and weren't allowed to read anything like @ORGANIZATION1, there would still be exceptions. In @CAPS5 book, a man named @PERSON3 goes into this @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 having read @ORGANIZATION1 to the point where he has memorized it. In the same way, if individual books were not allowed they would still be around somewhere for a person to get ahold of.     In conclusion, censorship on materials at libraries is limiting to a persons freedom and should not be applied. Materials in libraries were made to be read and reviewed by an audience, not shut away where only a select few can do so. If someone wishes to read or listen to something, it should be their decison as to whether he or she should. Knowledge is something that should be sought after, something that should not have any limitations."	7770	7771
5375	2	"A library is a place of information and wisdom. It is ment to help the person find what he or she is looking for. Even if the books are inapropriate and offensive it might serve someone elses needs.     Just because a book is offensive to the person doesnt mean they can't just put it down and walk away. They dont have to open or even look at it if it offends them.Taking that kind of material would only deminish the informational value of the library. You @MONTH1 as well take down the whole library because everything is offensive to someone somewhere.     As for movies and magazines, the same thing applies. just because its there doesn't mean you have to pick it up. I have read that even the most horrible information holds the most precious facts and information. It is meant to humor the writer and make them feel like they have accomplished something. It is a form of art that lets you express yourself in words and pictures without having to talk to someone.     Life isnt full of only good stuff and dreams. you cant just go around and censore everything that is bad. You just need to teach your kids not to read that kind of stuff. Teach them about the good and the bad because the world isnt all daisies and sunshine.     Our history hasn't been the most pleasent and unoffending so neither should our book, movies, or magazines. Every book holdes a significance to some one out there in the world. Taking the stuff of the shelf would cause us to take all the books off the shelf."	7772	7773
5376	2	"I believe that certain materials, such as books, music and magazines should not be removed from shelves if the are found offensive. I believe if you are offended by a book or other matrial you should not read or listen to it. If people removed all offensive materials from the shelves then what would be left on the shelves for the rest of us to read. Any materials put on the shelf for any of us should stay where it belongs.      Many times I hear people complaining about movies, books, and music and had them removed because it was 'offensive'. What if anyone had the right to remove 'offensive' materials from the shelves would there be anything left for the rest of us. Libraries should not stunt the growth of the shelf stock. Censorship is important but not as important as the knowlege of the children and if censorship blocks the truth then how will the children learn.      Censorship however is important for the fact it keeps the minds of the children clean and uncorrupted. If censorship was not applied what would happen to @CAPS1 youth. Would children think violence is ok or would they know better? Would the minds of the children be ok if there was no censorship or does it matter?     If censorship was not applied the knowledge of the world would be limitless regardless of your age. As the years come and go it appears that censorship in libraries is growing stronger not by removing the books, movies, and music but by making offensive materials less available for younger people.     Inconclusion matrials should not be removed from the shelves because in libraries the offensive materials are not available for young children"	7774	7775
5377	2	"There should not be censorship in libraries because everyone has their own opinon on what should be censored or what should not be censored or what is offensive and what is not offensive. Censorship is bias, personal, and unreasonable. Everyone should have the right to read or watch anything they wish too.     Censorship is bias because a group of people or individuals @MONTH1 think that a certain book or movie is good while another group of people think it is horrible. It varies from person to person just like their favorite flavor of ice cream.     Censorship is personal, everyone has their favorite genre or author but that does not mean that only one's favorite authors should be accepted while other authors be banned because one as an individual does not think that genre or author is worthy enough. Some authors @MONTH1 connect deeply with some people and not at all with some others.     Censorship is unreasonable because not everyone will agree to ban a certain book or movie or to not ban it. They will all have different opinions and view points on why it should or should not be banned. No one can say for sure that this is right or this is wrong. Who is right and who is wrong? More importantly, who will decide?     If anything should be banned from libraries it should be censorship itself. Censorship is bias, personal, and unreasonable. It just doesn't make any sense to censor one author, book, or genre and not any other. I very much agree what the quote by Katherine Paterson is trying to say. If all of us ban one thing then nothing will be left unbanned. Every human being is entitled to their own opinions and no one should try to take away something that has meaning for someone else"	7776	7777
7709	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in one big way, the time. The time greatly affects the speaker in many ways. For example, the time the cycleist gets to the first town, it has been abandoned for years. Second, the water spout didn’t work when he got to the cabin. Lastly, the @CAPS1 juice factory was abandoned when he found it on his lost journey. As you can see, time affected the cycleist greatly.  "	10709	
7710	3	"There are many features in the story’s setting that affects the cyclist. One of them is when he had ran out of water and he had nothing left because of the hot air. Then as he was riding along he saw a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit,” so then not only did he have to ride on this bumpy road, but he had to go even slower. Then when he riding on the road he saw a snake, which was blocking the whole path. Although he had many problems, there was one thing that helped him out which was the tiny rocks, because he had heard that if you suck on them it keeps your mind off the thirst @CAPS1 are some of the features in the storys setting that affect the cyclist"	10710	
7711	3	"The features of the setting was desert and dry land. The cyclist isnt through many ghost towns and abandoned factories. He said there was a huge snake a diamond back, which is a poisonous snake. "	10711	
7712	3	"The terrain and features of the land had a detrimentol affect on the cyclist. The author describes the setting as a barren, desclore landscape, which seems to go on forever. He describes his encounter with the snake by saying ""As sane point,tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously drop snote - it really did look life a determinol book-blocked the majority of the pavement in trony at me, The author uses effective word choices such as ""rediculously longe and I could drop from heatstroke"" to convey is almost hopeless mood. His encounter with the snake makes you pity him because he has had so many bad things happen to him. When he says tha he is worried about dying of heatstroke, you begin to worry about him. The author's portral of the bare, desclore landscape is an excellent way to set up a hopeless, certain mood."	10712	
7713	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example, in the text it states ‘I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is a reasonable setting to make the cyclist relatively parched. It also says “over one long, crippling hill” @CAPS1 shows that much effort was required to get over the hill. This effort takes it’s  tell when the author states “I wiped the sweat from my eyes” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. Obviously the setting’s features must affect the cyclist."	10713	
7714	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his physical condition in the text. In the text, the cyclist come to an unexpected realization that there wasn’t any water for him for a long period of his trip. Before he knew this , he had been “ hitting the water bottles pretty regularly” . as he traveled for a bit he noticed that the “ flat road was replaced by short rolling hill.” He then, due to lack of water, enter a “dehydrated state.” The” rolling hills” affected the cyclist because they are physically harder to overcome then flat land. The text also states that the cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June.” The climate of California in June is very hot, with lack of water; heat is also very or devasting and exhausting to the human body. That is how the features of the setting affected they cyclist."	10714	
7715	3	"In the essay,“Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie,there are several features of the setting that affect the cyclist.The first is the heat,which was so strong when he was cycling that he became dehydrated,“I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,”This was the element that most affected the narrator,because the heat caused his water deprivation which followed him throughout the essay.Another feature in the setting that affected the cyclist were the old men who gave the narrator the directions which led to his troubles in the first place.“Like a foolish youth,the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a “shortcut…” If the men hadn’t given him the unneeded and false information,he would have been able to make it to @LOCATION1 without all the troubles.The last element from the setting that affected him were the towns and how spread out they were from one another.“The old guys had swan the next town was only eighteen miles down the road.”If the towns had been closer together,the narrator could’ve gotten a drink faster and not have been as tortured by thirst as he was throughout the essay.The three elements had a major decision in the essay as well."	10715	
7716	3	"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist by not turning down the information from the well aged men. He shouldn’t have taken the information because the men haven’t left their porch for a long time and most likely didn’t keep up with the up to date cycling routes. Instead of taking the advise form the men he should have thanked them for trying to help, but listen to his conscience. Like he said,” they’d sounded so sure of themselves  when pointing and landmarks and spounting off towns l would come to along  this breezy jaunt .” it’s hard to turn down information when it seem’s so hard but sometimes you just have to do things yourself. In the last paragraph that he came across another man, but this one even older trying to give him advice on the best way to get to Yosemite. This time he didn’t take  the advice and just used his map."	10716	
7717	3	"On his way to Yosemite National Park the cyclist encountered a few things that slowed him down. One of the main factors of this trip was the heat, I knew this when it said, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” @CAPS1 factor was water because, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Hills @CAPS2 played a part of the setting when it said, “over one long, crippling hill.” @CAPS2 the cyclist had no where to stop which was a big factor, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” These are all of the factors that I thought the setting brought into affect."	10717	
7718	3	"The features in the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. Even though the cyclist didn’t show a sign of giving up on the tough hills, snakes, bad road condition, and most of all lack of water, the cyclist still showed confidence and determination. Without the obstacles in the cyclist’s way, there wouldn’t be need for “hard”, “concrete” determination to move on"	10718	
7719	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by acting as obstacle. For example, the man was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” running low on his water supply. Another obstacle was the bumpy road the man hit, acting to harden his time on the bicycle. One can surely realize realize the implied message of this map is not to mess with a good thing, in this story, the map. But, as he didn’t listen, the cyclist had to face the terrain mentioned before."	10719	
7720	3	"The setting as in enviorment the cyclist was in was a dry, hot, desert like place. It was hot as the sun was beating down on him and dry as there was no moister in the air. I say desert like because those conditions care like a desert limited water and all."	10720	
7721	3	"The hot dry setting affects this cyclist because of all the elements. The cyclist is all alone in the place one is riding at. There are not a lot of people on the wild life. It has a very bare landscape. There is not a lot of water or towns, all of these factors affect the cyclist. He gets dehydrated and could potenitally die in the middle of nowhere. As you can see the features of a setting affect a cyclist performance."	10721	
7722	3	"The features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in a few ways. First, there are rolling hills towards the end. It would be hard to get up the hills when you’re really tired. Also, there were no buildings to relieve him of his thirst. The story says “only a few tantalizing sips” were left in his bottle. He didn’t have much so he sucked on pebbles. Finally, the setting is in the high deserts, of California in june. The temperature would have been really hot then so he needed to stay hydrated. The text says “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regualarly.“ because it was so hot out where he had been biking. These are the reasons why the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	10722	
7723	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. This story takes place after the first town became ghost town. If it had still been a thriving town, he would have had more water @NUM1 miles into the bike ride. The road in which he traveled was also rough. This more than likely delayed his speed. Also, if he was bicycling in a city or town instead of outside of Lodi, California at a reservoir campground, he wouldn’t have had to worry about not having water as one can see, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. "	10723	
7724	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist. It seemed like as he rode it was the setting he looked at to keep him occupied. Then it was used more as a distraction when he ran out of water. He also used the setting as a guide to look for the park. At one point he was noticing something on ground that he thought was a large snake. It was one of the points where he was seeing things and running out of water. He has also describing the setting when he found the building. This was when he tried using pebbles to forget about his thirst. All during this the setting was his main thing as he was looking for the park. It affected what he saw and what he found out for himself. If anything it taught him something this was how the setting affected the cyclist.	10724	
7725	3	"The man had no water, it was dry and hot, he didn’t think he could make it. The water that was there was hot and tasted like “battery acid.” The abandoned Welch’s factory didn’t help, but he sucked on stones to keep his mind off of not having water to drink. When he finally reached the bait place he drank a lot of water and was satisfied.  "	10725	
7726	3	"The setting of the story causes many problems for the cyclist. For example, he asks some elderly men for directions and it takes him even longer then he had planned. Then he runs out of water and it is extremely hot outside. He finds a rusty pipe but it does not work. The hot temperatures cause him to get very weak. Then the flat road he is riding on started forming which made it difficult for him to ride his bike. The cyclist had a very difficult time making it to Yosemite."	10726	
7727	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasn’t well prepared for it. He expected more stops with more water, not cycling through ghost towns on a desert-like path. He uses the quote “breezy jaunt” which means he expected an easy ride. He got what he described as “one long crippling hill” meaning that the trip was indeed harder than he expected. He encountered rough roads and large snakes, not the towns and water he was expecting. They all cause him to become dehydrated lost and tired. He almost died because of his non-expectancy of the harsh settings, so he should have died there, but he persevered, and beat the disadvantage of not knowing the setting and made it to safety, through pure will."	10727	
7728	3	"Being a cyclist is very difficult when you are on a flat road or an incline the conditions are not that hard. However going up hills require a great effort. And since this cyclist was dehydrated it was probely very stranous. The weather seemed very hot and humid, which would make his trip even harder. Therefore the situations the author had to go through were very difficult."	10728	
7729	3	Some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist would be have the dry ground was. Another one would be the condition that the roads were in and the last one would be the row hot it was in california. One feature that they really exlabortes would be how dry the ground was. It was so dry that you could probably cook an egg on the ground. Everything there looked like it was fine to die. One thing that was said in the essay was the “rolling hills were like any runways”. Another feature the cyclist should looked was now the condition of the roads were. They were so  dry that they looked like dry land that would just break into poecies.” The roads were hot in good shape it wasn’t even a raq it was a dry dirt pathtrat he was riding on. The last feature was how hot it was in california. It was really hot it got up to @NUM1 degress. Those were the @NUM2 conditions that the cycle exlaborted on the must in the essay.	10729	
7730	3	"The cyclist seemed to have many bumps along the way to his suppose to be relaxing trip.”Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed these advice and launched a firstlight along “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to @ORGANIZATION1 “The cyclist shouldn’t have followed what the old timers said if he knew they hadn’t been out of town in forever. He sure did pay for it though. The cyclist had to go miles with little or no water, over hills when he could had been there by now. Next time the good thing to do would the cyclist follow his an instinct and used his good map he has. When he had to go to the @CAPS1 place and he had to pump the water and nothing good come out and he had to travel more out of the way to get refreshing water.”…time “over one ring, crippling hill a building came into new.” The traveled to hard and long and what he thought was an adventure until he found nothing from what the old men led him to.  "	10730	
7731	3	"It affects him greatly. I think he starts to get a little delerious because he sticks rocks in his mouth. I would never do that even if was thirsty. He thought it was going to be a shorter ride but it turned out to be even longer and more challenging. He had had a great out look on it before he left but as the trip went on it got worse and worse he passed a big snake and that make him scared. I think any one would be scared if a big snake ran across their bike. He even thought he was going crazy. He kept saying he thought he was going to die and he thought he washowing mirages. He was releived when he found this store and was 'proably' the climax of his trip. Like he @CAPS1” I want to find the ownerof this place and kiss him and by bait even though I don’t need any.” He tried to make the best out of the situation and with what he had. I think this was a story I would learn from. I liked it when he @CAPS1, “ I put all my troubles and fear behind me,” because that’s what every one should do."	10731	
7732	3	"There are many reasons why the setting affected the cyclist. One of these reasons was because of the high temperature. Being a cyclist, he had no protection from the sun, therefore the heat affected him more then they would have if he had been in a car. Another reason would be his lac k of water. Because he was mis-informed about the towns, he quickly ran out of water. And because of the heat he quickly could have become dehydrated And because the “towns” the men who gave him the directions,ended up being ghost towns, he had nowhere to get more water. The last reason would be because of the conditions of the road. It would have been easier if the roads were flat and straight. But they weren’t. They were short and hilly. As you can see, these are three reasons why the setting affected the cyclist."	10732	
7733	3	"There are many ways the features of the setting affected, the cyclist. One example is the rough roads and hills are hard to go over. I know this because in boy scouts we bike 12 miles on rocky trails. I usually dont bike much so this was a killer for me. Another example of the features affecting the cyclist is the sun. When you go riding you dont always think about the sun. Also in California there it gets very hot in the summer. So the cyclist was drinking water regularly to keep hydrated. I can relate to this because of boy scout camp are fear one scout didn’t drink enough water after being in the sun for many hours, and got heat stroke. So those are just a few examples of how the features of the setting can and will affect cyclists."	10733	
7734	3	"Many of the features in the setting affected the cyclist. If the story had taken place in a forrest, the cyclist might not have had some of the troubles he did. First, he was riding his bike in the desert. It is very hot in the desert and he had to drink more to try to stay hydrated. Also, the road he was had a lot of hills. It took him more energy to ride up the hills than it would have if he was riding on a flat land. This is how the features of setting affected the cyclist and made his journey more difficult."	10734	
7735	3	"In the story the cyclist realizes that they made a mistake after riding her bike, in the California desert in June with limited water and got directions from old people. When the cyclist wants to go to Yosemite he gets directions and is determined to get there. However he rides his bike casually drinking his water until there is basically none left. Also the cyclist runs into a huge diamondback snake which could’ve bit him. Then the cyclist thinks that they are getting overheated because of the unbearable weather. These are all problems the cyclist has because of the setting. The setting is deserted, hot and dangerous. As a result I’m sure the cyclist will never again travel in such conditions."	10735	
7736	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. At first the cyclist is confident. He feels the old men he has gotten his advice from are wise in their years. For he is going on a bike trip to Yosemite national park, and their advice, he thought, was about to cut many worthless hours out of that days trip. The first setting the cyclist comes too is a lonely old ghost town, which only beniftis that the old water fountin is still in service. This is houmourous to the cyclist. He now knows the old mens advice is not up to date. Then, to his dismay, he comes to an even more abandoned town, no working water pump. This troubles the cyclist. He is determined to reach his destination but he has a feeling in the back of his mind something will go wrong. Then he sees a snake not only making him scared and dehydration but naw he is afraid of what animals could potentially harm him once he is in his unconscious state after traveling more he sees an old abandoned grape juice factory. The picture and he frolicing child sipping the cool juice is somehow a taunt to his condition after pushing himself and using his knowlage of biking, he finds a bait shop and imideately enters. Even though he still hasn’t made it he now uses his own advice stick to your map."	10736	
7737	3	"The setting in the story do clearly effect the cyclist. For he started his day off early remembering the directions the people told him. And as he took the short cut they told him about he did come about the first town. And keep going. After @NUM1 miles he came to a pork. “It had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. “In the town was water pumps. As he realized he needed water, to got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” He kept going hoping the next town was only a few miles away. And as he road down the hills the anbareable heat kept coming down,” and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke..” The more he road the less energy he had. “..but no before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take  your mind off thrist...” Because the cyclist was in such unfamiliar terriory he freaked put with not knowing where to go he was sure he was going to die."	10737	
7738	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a ghost town and there was no people, so he couldn’t find any help. He then went to an old shock that had rusty pumps. He tried the water pumps, but all that came out was black tarlike substance that oozed out. He moved on and there was a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead,” he had to ride over some hills, he was almost running out of water. He didn’t see any buildings for miles. When he came over a hill he saw a building it was a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant, but there was nobody there, so he put some stones in his mouth to suck on. Then he found a fish camp and there was two guys there. He went to the bathroom and drank out of the sink."	10738	
7739	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a desert like area and the cyclist has no way of getting food or water. The cyclists chances of living of very low considering he has no food and that there arent any bodies of water around so he cant even get something to drink.	10739	
7740	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist greatly. The reason he is drinking so much water is because he is in the deserts of California in June, one of the hottest months. If the story had taken place in @LOCATION2, it would be cold, and he would’t have been drinking as much. Another thing that did’t help was,there was no buildings or gas stations on the shortcut he took."	10740	
7741	3	"Jagged rocks, steep mountains, windy roads- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the jagged rocks made it hard to ride your bike. For example, if a rock got stuck in your tired you would not be able to pedal anymore. In addition, the steep mountains made it nearly impossible to bike all the way to the top. You would need to stop and walk your bike up the mountain; using more energy. Also, the windy roads made it hard to maunver your bike. Lastly, the heat made you sweat more which made the cyclist dehydrated. Jagged rocks, steep mountains, windy roads- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist."	10741	
7742	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because that makes the cyclist mad a can not understand why they want let them ride on the road. So know it going to chase the cyclist to go on strike.	10742	
7743	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. There is no clear water so he could die of dehydration, its in California  so you know its going to be hot, theres a lot of hills, and to top it off hes not even too sure of where to go. In my opinion, for a cyclist, this is my worst fear because you need water and you need to know where you are heading to."	10743	
7744	3	"The setting in the story gave the cyclist some hard challenges to over come. Because there were hardly any towns around, he lacked food, water, and energy. In this case, he used pebbles he found on the road to circulate the saliva in his mouth. He predicted that be cause the road was so bumpy and mountanious, he might just swallow one. Also, the information he was given to head to Yosemite was very false and was out of date. He beleived this was from the people he listen to days ago had hardling been off their porch in years. As you can see, the setting of all of this events in the story affected how he got to Yosemite and how fast he got there."	10744	
7745	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, @CAPS1 had to ride through hills, dirt paths, rocky roads, and cross snakes, in order to get to her destination. @CAPS1 even rode through some of the highest deserts in California in June. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 was in a bumby situation.  @CAPS1 even came across an old building of some sort, one that used to make @ORGANIZATION1- the building hadn’t been used in so many years. “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” The cyclist is affected by the lack of water. @CAPS1 rode for about @NUM1 miles total with a water and then sucked on stones to help take her mind of the thirst. The features only affected her a little. @CAPS1 only had to pedel long distances and across uneven roads. Due to this, @CAPS1 got real thirsty and eventually got real mad at the old people, but at the same time @CAPS1 felt sorry for herself and laughed a sad, hopeless laugh. "	10745	
7746	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was lacking thirst and energy. He was lacking thirst because he was hitting the water bottles heavily, also he was lacking energy because he was peddling his bike up hill and around evening times."	10746	
7747	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to feel sorry for himself. The old men led him to believe that all the places that they told him to go would lead him yosmite National Park. Instead the first place he was takin to was an old abandond town that he said should have been called a “ghost town.” Then twenty miles up the road he was led to a ramshackele shed with several rusty pumps. This made him think because he was riding in the middle of a California desert and drinking up most of his water. So he worn of by the time he got anywhere.	10747	
7748	3	"In this essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist comes across many troubles and opsticles along his way. At first, he was feeling good he thought he would have a nice time until he started to run out of water. At the same time it was getting hot so he started to feel dehydrated and he was in the middle of no where. Next he came upon the problem of the road condition and the large snake which he got around quickly. Near the end he was rescued and felt well again. He learned to not trust old men and that he should have looked at the map for himself."	10748	
7749	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting in the story affect the cyclistics mood immensely. The cyclist feels determined, worried based on her surroundings. In the story, the main character the cyclist felt a sense of determination based on the features in the setting. For example, when she reached the first “town,” she felt in despair due to the pump that produced battery acidic water. (@NUM1). However, since she was unable to obtain water, and it was a hot, @DATE1 day in the deserts of California, she was determined to get water. When she reaches the abandoned @CAPS1 juice factory, the cyclist become worried. She is worried because she has been traveling on low water supply and there is no sense of human civilization in sight, not to mention any signs of water. For instance, she mentions, “id hung my head” when she realized her efforts were fruitless. In the story by Joe Kurmaskie, the settings of the story affects the cyclist and her mood."	10749	
7750	3	"The cyclist is affected by many different features of the setting. The cyclist had asked a couple old men how to get to somewhere. The old men gave the cyclist directions. As the cyclist is on his way to Yosemite National Park he sees the landmarks that the old men were talking about in @DATE1 but the places were so old, and they were abandoned. It was so hot and the cyclist was running out of water, he needed to find a place where he could find some water. Finally he saw a place and it was actually open. He got water & then asked someone else what the best way to get to Yosemite National Park was. The old man said yes and used a map to help him."	10750	
7751	3	"Cyclists are affected by the features of the setting. If a cyclist is surrounded by trees and a river, he is most likely not going to think about his thirst. But, if the cyclist is in a desert like setting, he will realize that he has grown very thirsty and weary.  For example, the guy in the story talks about how tired he has become.  “Wide rings of chied sweart circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day… simply because I listened to some gentlemen.” This sentence shows the reader that the cyclist would have been better off in another setting besides the desert, and he would not have been so miserable and tired if he didn’t listen to the men (who lead him to the desert). The surroundings of a cyclist affect their emotions and abilities.  "	10751	
7752	3	"At the beginning of the story, the cyclist was confident as he left the reservoir campground where he had been staying. When he arrived at the first “ town” on his stop, he say that the ""town"" wasn’t abandoned, but down, and not really much of a town at all. The author said it looked like a ghost town. This was amusing to the author, because the old co of gerd” he had been talking to had directed him to a ghost town. However, a short while later, when the cyclist saw the ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule, he began to feel troubled. The jiont of this second kud slow destination made the cyclist feel mad over as well. And when the water pump gave him a tarlike oozing substance, instead of water, he began to feel worse. When the terrain changes after this from a flat road to short rolling hills, the cyclist feels more down, trodde now that the terrain had become more rough. The cyclist says , “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” when he sees the “Rough Road Ahead” warning. Overall, the letting of the cyclist this is seen in fluential on his mood."	10752	
7753	3	There are key features people need to know about when cyclining. For one knowing how long the trip will be. Two where your going. Thee make sure you have enough water. These are all hey features everyone should borrow before cycling. You must also know the treine as it says in pre reading.	10753	
7754	3	"In the setting of “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” by Joe Kurmaskie the character finds himself at a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS2, California. Here at this reservoir campground where the character can find everything he needs he is looking for a quick way to resemite national park. A group of elderly men give the biker some advice  and the biker sets off early next morning following their advice. Things begin well for the biker but as his journey lingered onward he began to lose hope. Many of the towns and buildings mentioned by the old men were outdated and abandoned leaving no significant gains to the biker. The biker had realized these old men had placed his life in jeopardy even if the old men hadn’t realized it. The biker is quickly losing hope because  of two main things. One that he is dehydrated and all of the places he seeks sanctuary in feeling to be the farthest thing from a haven. Also, the setting where the biker could get everything he need at the reservoir and then follow his map to Yosemite made him lose hope. This kind of angers the biker to a point where he is oblivious to anyones advice."	10754	
7755	3	"After reading the essay named “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, I have concluded that the setting can affect a cyclist. In the essay, it says that there is a long crippling hill that he went up on his bike and then saw a building. He wiped his sweat from his eyes and tried to make sure that the building was not a mirage. This shows that the setting can affect the cyclist because the biker was sweating after he went up a long hill that was steep. That is very hard to go up. A quote from the text to support this statement is “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill “(@NUM1). This is all support for what I’ve said. The hot climate and the hills can make you see mirages which is not good and that means you need water."	10755	
7756	3	"When cycling there are many things that can affect your ride. In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it was listing to a group of elderly people and not having every mate. That made this ride problem. As the text says in the essay, the author says, “Wide rings of divided circled my sight and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke in this gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in decades caused me to laugh."" When the author chose to listen to the men it played the setting though an easy ride to a lot one with no water. If the author hadn’t chosen this she couldn’t have got those problems. It is not going to the @LOCATION1 and switching the more camals with losses. Houses and bikes are lot the good forms of transportation but if you put them in a new setting with very little uses to water and they don’t move as well."	10756	
7757	3	"The setting takes a large effect on the cyclist in the story. First, he is riding through California in June. Sammer in California is extremely dry and hot. Then to add to it, he is riding through a desert like area. This adds to the heat and dryness. Tumble weeds pass as he goes through a ghost town. This shows he is alone and no one is going to be around. Then the flat road goes into hills. This makes the ride harder and harder. He must put forth more energy to go up the hills. All the difficulties affect the rider as he lacks water and slowly dehydrates going through the desert in June."	10757	
7758	3	"When traveling, many aspects or obstacles can slow a person down. In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit, Joe Kurmaskie uses rough obstacles such as lack of hydration, the heat, and terrain changes which affects the cyclist. The lack of water on his cycling journey creates fatigue, and hopelessness for the narrator. This is because the narrator is low on water and the pump he hopes to fill up his water bottle with only dispenses brackish brown water with an unpleasant taste. The heat obstacle ties in with the water scarcity because the heat is creating perspirating for the author and because he is not hydrated, the heat is affecting his journey. Along with the water and heat which were affecting the narrator by slowing him down, there was a change in terrain with short, rolling hills. Everything was put together to slow down the narrator because of the effect of every obstacle."	10758	
7759	3	The extreme condition of the California desert took a toll on the cyclist and his need for water. At a certain point in the passage the author wrote about how he thought he would die from heat exhaustion before making it to the next town.	10759	
7760	3	The setting that first affected the cyclist was the heat and lack of water then a more chalanging terrain came up then he also rode through ghost towns that had no water.	10760

7762	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, showing his waining faith in his situation. For example, about @NUM1 miles into his ride from the place where the old codgers give him advice he arrives at the first town like area. Because this town looks to him deserted, like a ghost town, it causes him to conclude that no one has lived there since the last world war. Consequently, he feels the men gave him bad directions and must continue on his journey. Furthermore, when he sees the sight that reads “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” he feels life is cruel because the limit is 55 mph, but he is only capable of going 12 mph with little water. Seeing the sign makes the cyclist loose faith. Finally, when he sees the abandoned Welch’s Juice factory the cyclist hangs his head. He sees the irony in that now, of all times he runs across a juice factory in a desert, but there is not a drop of liquid to be found. The cyclist hanging his head shows how this ironic situation affects him negatively, causing him to lose faith. In summation, the setting features in the Essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” cause the cyclist to loose faith in surviving his situation of being lost in the desert en route to Yosemite National Park.   "	10762	
7763	3	"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting affects the cyclists ability to travel. He started out in the woods where it was peacefully and he was confident he would make it to his destination. As it said, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” He was in a great setting to bike ride, but the setting soon changed, which made it very difficult for the cyclist to continue. As he described, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” When he was already tired for cycling that long, hills are the last thing a cyclist wants to see. It made his trip even more challenging. However with determinatiom, the cyclist found water. I can relate to this story, my friend and I went hiking one day and only bought enough supplies for a few hours. We ended up getting lost and had no food or water left. Then it started to get dark. However we didn’t panic and we tried to work our way down the mountain where our parents found us. Our setting affect us because all the trees look the same and we were exhausted for climbing the mountain. Therefore the cyclist was affected by the setting."	10763	
7764	3	"Joe kurmaskie author of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” uses descriptive words of imagery to make the reader understand the writing on a deeper level. “several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greet me. This sight was troubling."" @CAPS1 the reader with a feeling that something is terribly wrong. The way he describes the features of the setting gives his writing an edge. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “the words kurmaskie uses rolls of the tip of your tounge and making the essay real. The author uses olner phrases such as “maneuvered down the hill” to describe his frightening eperience in the worst conditions, an unfamiliar dry area where nothing is alive."	10764	
7765	3	"The features of the setting affect the clist by deping him of water. He wouldn’t need so much water if it here nor June, in the deserts of California. Also, large in the deserts of California, the cyclist has nowhere to refill his water bottles. Another important feature of the setting is the Welch’s impecture factory, which ads a seeming and wanting element to the setting, making the cyclist despaire even more. Finally, the hills make the journey that much more difficult. "	10765

The cyclist didn't have much water and was far aways from a town put her in serious danger of a heat stroke. She put a rock in her mouth haping it would get stuck in her throat. Then he see a snake which nuts the cyclist in more danger. The winds and Up hills and downhills of the road begin to make a toll on the cyclist.Finally as the cyclist reached water."" Drank deeply from the sink"".he goes outside and a old man gives him directions. This cyclist will never take directiond from a old person again, but just use his map."	10766	
7767	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the story is about survival. For example, when the cyclist reached his first checkpoint he was expecting a lively town with a place to get water. However, all he found was a shed with a water pump that pumped a warm, “tarlike substance”. When he got back on the road to head towards the next town, the author described how the terrain changed, making his journey even harder. He peddled on, only to pass an abandoned grape juice factory reminding him of his overwhelming thirst before he finally arrived at a bait shop to get water. The setting is important in this story, because it shows the reader the hardship that the cyclist faced."	10767	
7768	3	"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, explaing how the setting of the essay effected the cyclist. For example in the essay, the speaker says, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” This @CAPS1 us that the sun is not causing the rider to slow down. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” is another example that @CAPS1 us the way that the land is effects how the cyclist can ride. “I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth” @CAPS1 us the because the weather is so hot and the cyclist is out of water, he is resorting to pebbles to help him remain somewhat hydrated."	10768	
7769	3	"The features of the setting did affect the cyclist as he did ride through his journey. The cyclist was riding in a hot desert area of Lodi, California where it was very hot. This in turn made him drink a lot of his water and as he kept on riding he ran short on water. I know this because it says “ I had been hitting  bottle regularly”.   This is showing how he is drinking a good amount of water and not is close to his destination. Another feature could be the hills that he ran into because the hills made him tired. I know this because it says “ my last burst of energy I managed down the hill”. This shows how he became tired. The theme of this passage was never get directions from old people. This shows because the divedens the old people gave to him made him go through a lot more trouble than he wanted to."	10769	
7770	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” several features of the setting affect the cyclist. One is that the town he passes along the way are often deserted. He says one “fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” This affects him because there are no people there to ask for guidance. Later he cannot refill his water supply because of the rusty pump. Later, a snake forces him to move cautiously through the road. However, the most important factor is the blistering, sweltering heat of the sun. It both makes him uncomfortable and dehydrates him. It forces him to use up his water supply. His water is the most important factor to him on his trip. He says I was travelling through the high deserts of California on June.” This is very hot, which affects him a lot. These numerous factors affect the cyclist on his trip."	10770	
7771	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead:Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit,"" the setting really affected the cyclist. He listened to some ""old timer"" that told him a ""short cut""to get to Yosemite. He listened to them and he realized that it wasn't much of a shortcut. He had to travel through many obsticles to find fresh water. ""Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills."" He had to travel several miles without water and now he has to go over a lot of small hills to find water. The hills are much harder to travel on than flat road, especially when you are tired and don't have any water. ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake"" If therefore tumbleweeds, that shows that he is in avery dry area and it will be hard to find water. He also has to watch out for dangerous snakes and other animals, and if he is tired and thirsty it is hard to concentrat and watch put for snakes. If his surrounding were different than the bicycle ride to Yosemite probably would have been easier."	10771	
7772	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was tired and needed water. Then it was a rolling hills road coming up and he was very hot. It was no buildings or anything in site so that he could get directions. Also should men who in hadn't left those porch in years gave him wrong directions so they affected the cyclist. He didn’t set to where he was going	10772	
7773	3	"There are many features of a setting that can affect the cyclist. One features is the condition of the road. If the road is slick and slippery, there is a huge possibility that the cyclist @MONTH1 slide of the road and get injured. Another features of a setting that can affect a cyclist is the weather. The power of winds @MONTH1 knock the cyclist off of his/her bike. It could possibly lift the entire bike off of the ground. In the reading Rough Road Ahead, all things I said that would affect a cyclist, affected the cyclist in that story. He had a problem with the road conditions as well. He went through rolling hills that played a gigantic part in his performance."	10773	
7774	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, “This quote from the text shows how the desert have affected the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist is riding through desert terrain and must drink lots of water to stay highdrated. Another example is how the setting affected the cyclist is, ""At some point a ridiculously large snake blaked the majority of the pavement."" The snake is part of the desert setting of the essay. The snake caused the cyclist to slow down and ease past the snake. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist is, “I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. The cyclist was out of water in the middle of the desert and stuck pebbles in his mouth in attempt to take his head off thirst. The desert setting is what caused him to do this. In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	10774	
7775	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when the authors says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” It is evident that because of the heat, the cyclist was getting thirsty, and tired. Later, the cyclist begins to relize that he will most likely run out of water and die because he can’t find the “town” the old men had told him about. The character writes, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the cyclist can’t find water, he is becoming scaned and hopeless. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is when he finally finds a place to get water, at Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp. “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had do over whelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This shows how relieved and grateful the cyclist was to be able to get water and to rest a while."	10775	
7776	3	"I the story the fechers skair the cyclist. The fechers in the setting were  “ There was no one in sight, not as buildings, car, or structure of any kind. “ He is skaired because he is realy thirsty and ther is no one around."	10776	
7777	3	"The landscape and it’s features greatly affect the cyclist. First, the flat road he describes is easy for him to ride on. The empty towns have no water in them, which makes him thirsty. The rolling hills make him tired, and the bait store refreshes him."	10777	
7778	3	Features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. For example in a perfect day degress wise cyclist will not get exhaghested that easy and can ride faster longer. Another reason is that cyclist would have to trouble turning in the rain or fog. If the setting was mostly a straigh course that they would make it easily but if the course was curvy and had alot of hills than it would be harder to complete at top speed. That is on essay how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	10778	
7779	3	"Many things affected the cyclist. First, he was running out of water. This made him very tired. Second, it was a hot day which also made him tired. Third, the road was hard to ride on."	10779	
7780	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist because he or she is in the desert, in the middle of June. If the cyclist had not been in the desert he or she would not of become dehydrated so easily. It is a lot hotter in the desert than in the country because there is nothing there to shade you From the sun, plus it is mid-June so the sun is more intense. An example that demonstrate the setting would be “at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path” this statement implies that the cyclist is in the desert."	10780	
7781	3	The features in the setting of the story are a major affect to the cyclist because after the “old hugs” gave him the advice of were to go if wouldn’t have become such a big deal if he didn’t have water but since the heat was so hot he was going to need water in order to survive in the terraine. Also it wouldn’t have been as bad if the roads were flat ground but since the roads become rougher `it was tougher to be able to ride a smooth which helped exaggerate the need of water came more.	10781	
7782	3	"Different features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways. In the beginning of his journey, he travels through what he says looks like a “ghost town.” @CAPS1 he passes a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” These sights caused him to feel troubled. He did not know exactly where he was and was seeing unusual sights. The cyclist found a place to pump out water and became desperate when only a “tarlike substance worked out”. He was in the middle at the desert with little water remaining in his bottle and became desperate when he discovered that he couldn’t even get clean drinking water. Next, he came across a sign that read “rough road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” this was from the short, rolling hills. This caused him to start losing his optimism. He figured the trip was not going to get better any sooner. He @CAPS1 receives a “growing realization” because he begins to see the reality that he could have a heatstroke or pass out from dehydration at any moment. There are many different feelings but the main is desperation."	10782	
7783	3	"In the story “Do Not exceed posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie a cyclist had many hardships due to the mistake of following old persons advice. For example, as the cyclist began he was on a roll and happy. However. a little town followed by a ramshake, old pumps and an old, burnt out mule corral became frightning, the narrator says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, ant I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June “(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The narrator was scared because they didn’t wish to die. The setting of not being able to obtain water was another sure sign of death. The narrator says, “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The cyclist was in a horrible state of disbelief and beginning to hope everything he saw next was a mirage to comfort him a little more. The setting sure does not help the cyclist hope because it was so hot and unwanted. In the end the cyclist came upon another older man with a good map to tale and the narrator says, “And I promised myself right then "	10783	
7784	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist takes the old guys directions to Lodi, California. Along the way he encounters several features including an old town, old pump station and an old juice factory. The old town he came to “fit the traditional definition of a ghost town” according to the quote. It was the firstthing that made him wonder about the directions. Then the old pump station came into his journey. Its old pump had warm water not fit to drink. It was the thing that made him wonder about his water supply. The final thing was the juice factory. He was pretty much out of water and the building kind of teased him. That factory is what he thought would save him at first. When he finally got to the last building with a bathroom, another old guy offered him directions, he didn’t take them but he did take some water. The features in the setting had a major influence on his entire journey."	10784	
7785	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The hot dry air made him thirst. He needed water & couldn’t find It. The bumpy road made him almost choke on rock. Also that he was in California in the middle of June, made him hot, @CAPS1 and thirsty."	10785	
7786	3	"The setting affect the cyclists drastically, because throughout the whole short story  he is dehydrated and needs some fresh water because of the humid, dry air of where he was travelling. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,"" (paragraph @NUM1). Since he was on his bicycle for so long, he was feeling dehydrated and kept drinking his water frequently. He started running out of water, and because he was in the hot desert, he was getting more and more thirsty as time went on. It was also in the middle of the summer, so the heat was really getting to him, and he was becoming really thirsty. Also in the short story, he sucked on pebbles to try and get his mind off of his thirst. “I got back to the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth.” He was so thirsty that he grabbed some pebbles to stop thinking about how thirsty he was. The setting’s climate greatly affects the cyclist throughout the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie."	10786	
7787	3	In the story “Do not exceed pasted speed limit.” The author wants you to know that there is a rough road ahead and yo don’t speed while on the road.	10787	
7788	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has no water and he’s un the middle of no where. Also he runs unto a dimond back snake that is poison is and could kill him.	10788	
7789	3	"The author was riding his bike on a hot day in June on the California desert. It was very hot and dry. It doesn’t rain often in the desert, therefore the ground was dusty and dirt easily flew. Also, it was in the middle of June, therefore it was very hot. “...but not before i gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth,” the author wrote, telling a part of his story. He had been so thirsty he resided to sucking on pebbles to keep his mind off of his thirst. He also came across a sign that said” Rough road ahead,” having a rough road made the author have to use more energy to maneavor over it, while he was already very thirst and didn’t have the energy to."	10789	
7790	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story in many ways by how they react. In the story they talk about how there was a resivor campground outside lodii California. The cyclist need to have a good environment in order to affect them. It also affects how old the people are around them. In conclusion the setting affects the cyclist.	10790	
7791	3	"The cyclist was riding to get to a destination. His advice from old guys was, “to take a shortcut” or the backroads in other words. We all know the backroads of any destination are crummy. This naive cyclist decided to plung forward into high, unknown deserts. Along his ride he pasted signs, an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Juice Factory, an old water pump that spit out black battery acid tasting substances. The road became short hills with desert feature. A tumble weed even blew in front of him. He kept trending on, however, in what seemed to be a deserted and hopeless place with the hot sun only growing on his back. The conditions of this bike ride were very dangerous for the cyclist He didn’t have much water. He even states, “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”, The aspects of the “road” were very harsh on him and the hot sun didn’t help either. Lucky for the fresh sink of water that saved him from near death of the killing desert."	10791	
7792	3	The setting has a very big effect on the cyclist. The setting is in the deserts of California in June. This makes it extremely hot. Because the cyclist is using a lot of energy to go from one place to another he gets thirsty easily. The setting makes this conflict worse. He is very dehydrated by the time he finds water.	10792	
7793	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist's ability. In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist endures many problems. But with the help of the setting he faces those problems to find his way. In the story it says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers had my name written all over them.” This part of the setting helps the cyclist keep going. It also says ""over one long crippling hill, a building come into view."" ""With what I believed to be my last burst of energy I maneuvered down the hill."" @CAPS1 the setting the cyclist would not have made it."	10793	
7794	3	"The features of setting affect the cyclist because the hot temperature, beating sun light, and rough terraine made his lack of water move prominent. In the text it says,” I wiped the sweat from  my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” This is proof that he was so hot that he was getting  weary; and the fact that he would see a mirage was not unlikely. Had the cyclist been traveling in a different condition, such as shaded forests or a suburban region with civilazation near by, the lack of water would not have been an issue. The features of setting create conflict in the story, and cause serious problems for the cyclist."	10794	
7795	3	In the features of the setting affect the cyclist by if the road or path is flat it is easier to pedal but if it is more hills it is harder to move on. Also you have to remember that with no water there he was having a hard time going along with the heat. Also he is going about 12 mph he said while in the heat with no water. Finally he stanble to a juice factory and nothing to drink so he leads on and finds the bait company while so that is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	10795	
7797	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in two ways in the begging the cyclist wasnt sure of himself. He knew that he was in a @CAPS1 desart in June, which made him wonder if he would survive. Also, the terrain changed from flat road, to rolling hills. This made it harder for him to pedal and he still wondered if he would survive. Once the cyclist saw a sign that said “Gary and Wilber"" Fish camp” his mood changes he then belives that he will survive because he can get water there."	10797	
7798	3	"The features of the terrain greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding in desert-like terrain. There were no people or buildings in site. There was a snake. The cyclist was riding into an old ghost town and he had a lack of water. “there was no one in sight, not a building,car, Or structure of any kind."" He was determined to get to a place where he could get more water. “ Telling myself that if I could make it that far I’d be fine.” The cyclist was so determined to get to a place so he could survive he started working harder. The barren desert land motivated him to push himself to his limits. “With my last burst of energy I manuovered down the hill.” He saw the terrain and got back up on the bike and he got himself to safety. The terrain in the setting motivated the cyclist."	10798	
7799	3	"The features of setting affect the cyclist by the person riding a bicycle on the road. Also, when the person road twenty miles up the road he came to a fork of sork. Another word, the person was going @NUM1 when the speed limited is @NUM2. Then the person come to be crazy because, the person try to be blind by saying, “there are no car, nothing around here."	10799	
7800	3	"In this short story, the setting has very large effect on the cyclist. For example, in the beginning, the cyclist has no problem with his and seems to be doing fine. As the day goes on, the cyclist starts to get thirsty due to the high heat and even more tired due to the rouhg terrain. When he finally spots ""Gary and @CAPS1 Fish camp"" he feels a state  of releif because he knows that he has found the cool water seems to give the cyclist a sense of relief and requiremate him so he is prepared for the rest of his trip. This exparience is like when you are a little led and you want a specific toy and you feel like you are going to die if you don't get it but in this one, it is wanting water due to dehydration, but it still seems as if it is a life or death situation. "	10800	
7801	3	There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feauture was running out of water and the flat roads turned	10801	
7802	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because different setting calm and rehy the cyclist both mentally and physically. For instance if your cycling in shades well populated cool are you will feel sufer more relaxed and calm if somthing should happen where as if you are in a desert with no one around out of water your done the birds will pick you clean leaving your gear behind. Also if your near water like a river the cyclist would feelbettte knowing he can easily get water when needed and food to where if your not near water you to monitor your water so that you dont run out. Finally having a map to know your settings help cause if you get lost you can map a route to a city or a small town or find a lake or river to get food or water to make that extra fourty miles to civilization. So that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	10802	
7803	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was nowhere that he knew he was getin in the path he was heading. Also he didn’t have any water. He felt like he was going to die and the birds would eat him.	10803	
7804	3	because the knowledge of cycling  is limited dont its not a right	10804	
7805	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One example is when they say “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June”. This affects the cyclist because seeing and being in the desert in the middle of the summer without little water makes him more hot every minute. Another example is when they say “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”. This affects the cyclist because he is struggling more that he has to ride up the hills. The best example is when they said “the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it-had been a @CAPS1 Grape juice factory and bottling plant”. This affects the cyclist because he see’s a juice factory that has been shut down. Many features of the setting affected the cyclist."	10805	
7806	3	The effect in climate was that the hill tired him.	10806	
7807	3	"The setting in the story changes as the cyclists emotional and physical condition dease. In the begining he I having an enjoyable bike ride down to @ORGANIZATION1, on a nice leam day with flat roads. But when he takes a shortcut that the elderly people told him hes started to run into a bit of trouble. After riding a long way to the first town he was pretty tired and needed water. But the well water hes onsonitery so he decided to take a risk and bike on to the next town. This is when he started to have trouble . The terrain changed to a hilly road, and as the ride got harder he became more discouraged. He said “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realizetion that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day.” He only become even more discouraged as he went on with little weter with the posabilaty of dying still uprising. Then atlest he found the town and hes relieved."	10807	
7808	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist and his journey by many aspects. There was the fact that it was very hot and the feature that he was a lone. The fact that the cyclist was hot, had many side effects that affected the cyclist. For instance, it is a hot day in June in the middle of a vast day desert that would make you up you guesed it!Thirsty!Thus,the  weather or  hotness affect  the cyclist  by  makes him thirsty. Another feature that affected the cyclist was that no one else was around, he was utterly alone, thus if you were alone in the desert with a  snake  in  the middle  of  the  road ,lalid  coming  at  of  the water pump and hard stroke a chance you would you feel? If I can just get is that hill, I’ll be ok, therefore the feature of “lenesonaaese” (If there is a hard like that) made loan determined.In conclusion,there were many features that  affected the cyclist, the feature of weather, (or how hot it was) The feature of his completly and uttely done he was witch made him thirsty from the exctter and it to  fressthe lonly feeling."	10808	
7809	3	"Many things can make and or cause complications during an adventure such as cycling. The weather can play a major effect on succeeding. Wether the temperature is bad or cold. Another effect is the roading conditions like the steepness of the hill or the roughness of the road. And the will or the determination can effect the cyclist. There are many things that can effect a cyclist, although I only named the most difficult to overcome."	10809	
7810	3	" The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. “The sun was beginning to beat down.” The sun was very hot on the cyclist for he had a long way to travel. “One ramshackle shed…” The towns that he went to were all abandoned. This made the cyclist very sad because he was losing hope on finding water. The cyclist thought that he was going to die. He had enough determination though to keep going, and he made it to a shop on the way back where he could reclench his thirst because he was dehydrated."	10810	
7811	3	"The setting that the cyclist confronted in the story,” Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected him and his feelings in many different ways throughout the story. He, at the end realized that the world changes with time as the world’s setting does too. If he had realized this sooner he @MONTH1 have not followed the old men’s advice and, rather would have went with his near, up to date maps. Another features the setting that affected the cyclist was that is was June in California and he was runningout of water. He would become very dehydrate during the time of year in this place even with water. The desert was hot already, but must have seemed unbearable in June. The only thing that was giving him hope and determination after going several miles without any water was the setting of Yosemite paste, with it’s cool waters and pine trees for sheet. The ghost towns with no water also filled him with despair because not one of the three setting had any waters. The must have filled him with despair, but also determines to get to the water of Yosemite, or for that  matter, anywhere with fresh, clean, cool water. Finally the last setting he came to with the water from the sink must have filled him with asignificant amount of relief and gratitude so that he was ready to loss the owner of the store. The setting here gave the cyclist determination, relief, and the realization to now trust himself and his map.     "	10811	
7812	3	"The features in the story “Do no exceed posted speed limit” most definitely affect the cyclist. The conditions of the road are one of these, and the weather is another. The cyclist was negatively affected by both of these conditions throughout this story. The road conditions for the cyclist were trecherous. There were tumbleweeds, snakes, and bumps all over the place. “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel “(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Indeed, with the lack of water and the horrid road, life for the cyclist was extremely cruel. Although the cyclist states that the weather is beautiful, he soon learns that it is not, under his conditions. The lack of water and all-day cycling made the sun feel like it was “@CAPS1 down” (pt) a lot of harder than it actually was. The weather was also affecting his cycling, by slowing him down more than he already was slowed by the road conditions. Therefore, both the weather and the road conditions negatively affected the cyclist on his long track."	10812	
7813	3	The girl was on bike and all by herself. @CAPS1 took directions from a group of gentlemen and they were wrong @CAPS1 got lost with nothing to drink. When @CAPS1 thought @CAPS1 was going to where @CAPS1 wanted to get to @CAPS1 found a sink. From there @CAPS1 got to Yosemite National Park.	10813	
7814	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. Because he is in the middle of the desert and dose not no ware to go. He lisind to some old guy's and they said it was a short cut but it got him lost and he had no water. And there was nothing in site not a house or care, or bildding. But he  finally made it to were there was some water and then he ask for derecshon again."	10814	
7815	3	"There are a lot of features in the story that would definetely affect the cyclist. First of all because you are riding a bicycle is not fun to ride on a bumpy road. You would be going all over the place if you were on a rough road just riding a simple bicycle. Next if you were on a rough road just riding a simple bicycle. Next if you’re going someplace in a bicycle and you know it's going to be hot. Be sure to take an extra bottle of water. The cyclist only took one bottle and ran out of water. He or she could dehydrate from bicycling in a hot weather without water. If you have never know if you can trust the person you ask directions to. The cyclist had a map but was stupid enough just to use an old person for directions intead. So he or she ended up in the middle of nowhere. There was no one sight, no buildings, no cars, no nothing. A lot of features affected the cyclist on his/her journey."	10815	
7816	3	The feature of the setting effected a big part of acomplishing the cyclists task. I hot wheather defenily affected his metavalich and really wan him out faster than he mended. The lack of water also didn’t help him out at all because since he wasn’t stay hydretted he got tired quiclky. The hills and the challanging terrain contributed to him have to push himself more. Also the dangerous area didn’t help the mental part of the the either. He really had to pace himself hot with the water but with the riding part as well. Also the abandidness played a part in him feeling alche and helpless. It also made him think of dying in the heat all by himself. All the surroundings affected the hardness of the trip. It also made the cyclist have to work harder and perservere.	10816	
7817	3	"The features affect the cyclist a lot. First of all, all the heat that he has to take has made him drink up all of his water and he has become very dehydrated. Also, the snake blocking his path makes him waste prescious time because he doesn’t have much water left and the snake could bite him so he has to be slow to get around it and not scare it, the pebbles help him by keeping how much spit he had in his mouth so he atleast had something to drink. The direction given by the old men was usless because it only made his trip worse because he get lost and was almost near death because of a heatstroke from all the heat that was beating down on him."	10817	
7818	3	One of the things that effected the cyclist is the lack of water. He was riding in the middle of know where without water. After he realized that he stumbled onto another conclusion a snake. The snake was blocking his path.	10818	
7819	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. In the beganing of the story the man was talking about how he ""enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these ald codgers."" Then in the middle of the story the man is talking about having a heatstroke. At the end of the story the man is thinking he is going to die. The setting of the story was on this mountain and it was a nice hot summers day. The features make this summers day one of the worst."	10819	
7820	3	The setting in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit is extremely important and effects the cyclist. The story is set in the summer during June so it is very hot and it is set in California so it is even hotter. The story also says he is riding through a desert with nothing around so there is no place for him to get water. The cyclist begins to run out of water and is worried that he will not make it to the next town. The setting of the story really adds to the doubt that the cyclist will not make it because he really puts you in a negative mind set.	10820	
7821	3	"The author informs us that cycling through the desert is hard especially with all of the drink reminders when he’s running low on water. First he comes across a pump and he hopes to get water to fill his bottles all the way. But a “farlike substance oozed out….It had the flavor of battery acid,” came out of the rusty pump meaning he wouldn’t fill his bottles yet. Then, he comes across a Welch’s Grape Juice factory that has a “picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth…” and is reminded and crushed all over again! The features in the setting were a constant reminder of what he needed, but couldn’t find."	10821	
7822	3	"The cyclist is biking in very hot weather conditions, where he has no idea of his surroundings because he has to ask for directs and also has no water. The road conditions did not make it easy for him to get to his desired destination either. The snake in the middle of the sidewalk probably scared him a little too. All of these factors made it more and more difficult for the cyclist to get where he was going. They are like obstacles, tough things that you have to overcome to get where or what you want."	10822	
7823	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the author reveals many features of setting that affect the cyclist. For example, the cyclist travles to one town to get water but the water was way to hot a tasted like battery acid, @CAPS1, the author says that the cyclist is travling in hot desert area. Finally, the author shares that there are long distances between towns. Those are three features of how the setting affects the cyclist. "	10823	
7824	3	"In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by making him feel like he’s gonna die For example, he says, “It don’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds were gonna pick me clean”. Also he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat”. That is how the setting affects him."	10824	
7825	3	"It was a hot day and the man was in the desert so he was probably overheated. He ran out of water which is never a good thing, especially under his conditions. The man was on a bike so he probably got tired after a while. “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”, just by hearing that you can tell he was frustrated, hot, and thirsty."	10825	
7826	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” cause the author to feel despair. He was cycling to Yosemite Park and some old men told him a short cut which ended up going through the desert. No one was anywhere near him the whole time. There were only a few abandoned buildings. The author described it as, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.”  While cycling through this the author thinks, “I was going to die…” @CAPS1 he was despairing. He was thinking negative thoughts because he had given up. He was however still determined to try and reach some form of civilization, which ended up being a fish bait store. The desert really makes people despair because it feels as if there is no hope of any civilization anywhere in the inhabitable landscape."	10826	
7827	3	"In the setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had features the affected the cyclist. In the story one feature was the  lack of water on his journey. When he first listen to the old men he almost ran out of water. Another feature was the road change. I went from nice to rough and he encountered a snake on the way. These features made the cyclist think about his decisions that day. This is how they affected him. They made him rethink about his decisions. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist has some encounters with nature that affect his choices."	10827	
7828	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him sad. After setting out to what he thought was a shortcut he ends up in the middle of nowhere. In the end he should have gone with his instincts and followed the map.	10828	
7829	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist because it's hot and dry while  he's riding. These are hills, snakes, heat, and not alot of water. You know it's hot because the text says “The sun was beginning  to beat down” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This narration indicates that it was hot. There’s also hills that he passes that makes it tough because of the lack of water. Finally, one knows there's not alot of water bacause the text says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”(Kurmaskie @NUM2). This means he doesn't have much water left. The conditions are bad while riding because it's hot and there's not alot of water."	10829	
7830	3	"He features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story by Joe Kurmaskie. In the essay, the cyclist is surrounded by wilderness, and there is no civilization or “life” in sight. This setting affects the cyclist by giving him a feeling of despair and hopelessness: “It was a sad. Hopeless laugh. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The sight of nothingness gave the cyclist a feeling of hopelessness because there was no goal ahead that he could strive for. For example sports competitions always contain a goal of winning; either scoring the most points, or finishing first in a race. Having a goal present to strive for gives the player. Some hope and determination, but in the story, there was no goal or hope in sight thus leaving the cyclist full of despair and having no hope of winning the race."	10830	
7831	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. When he comes to the first town the cyclist finds it humorous, considering it is now a ""ghost town"". Then the author comes to the ""ramshackle shed"" and ""rusty pumps"". This disheartens the cyclist, since he knows he is running low on water. Then, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"". At this point the setting is starting to act against the cyclist. After this the author comes to abuilding that, ""had been a Welch's Grape Juice Factory"". This is an ironic twist, considering he is dehydrated. The setting of this story affects the cyclist throughout the story."	10831	
7832	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is saying that it would be “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers. It will also affect the setting because it is talking about the author’s challenging problems during his journey. The setting will affect the cyclist because the author was cautions against accepting advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.	10832	
7833	3	Well I t was very hot in the desert and the cyclist was beginning to get dehydrated. He was a bit diocented by the last  of effective the shal town stream. He was tired at the winded roads of the life he was bringing down on him. Meeting him very last of them @MONTH1 have his  long way from him the nearest of home.	10833	
7834	3	where to go into they haven't left there porch since carter was president and so on. Though then he had tough torain because of goin off road and ruhning into the snakes. Thouhg it was like he was running into every little pebble he got to. The setting is crazy for where this get is in does weather and going up to down hills.	10834	
7835	3	"The setting of Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit is in a very desert like place. This plays a huge role on how the author writes his story. He is on his way to Yosemite, and asks an elderly man for directions. He then gives him a “shortcut” and the cyclist listens. Then on his way he runs out of water. He goes through old deserted towns and tries to get water from the one but it is extremly hot and tastes like batery acid. Then he is going down the road and notices a building. He gets to it and it is yet another deserted building. He picks up some peble and puts them in his mouth and suckle on them because he heard that would help him from thirsty ahead needing a drink. He finally gets to a town and gets water. if this story didn’t take place in such a hot place, the meaning wouldn’t be the same, or make as much sence. "	10835	
7836	3	"It was hot and hummed in @LOCATION1 was hot and the cyclist was sweating like water fountain. He shaoald have never listed to the old men that gave him directions to where he wanted to go. He should of keep on following the map direction,"	10836	
7837	3	"The setting is like a dessert, so it’s going to effct him a lot. First reason it would effect is there is no water around so that would give him no energy. Another reason it would effect him is there is barely any civilization in the dessert, so he wouldn’t be able to get food, water or gas. These are my reasons that the setting effects the cyclist."	10837	
7838	3	"The setting of the story really affected the rider. It was a humid day with only a few bottles of water. The sign says “caution Rough road ahead.” It is flat terrain turned into small hills. Exhausted and dehydrated he pushed himself as far as he could go, up and down hills. Finally sight and old building. He had as into the bathroom and splashed cold water onto his face. When walking out with a dripping wet face, an old man in the chair asked him if he had direction. He said I have a very good map. He just stood there and listened to the old timer speak. He then he had been off the pord, in so long. The biker would not of used his directions anyway. It took @NUM1 miles just to get to the first town. Back a little ways in the sign said do not exceed the speed limit, which was @NUM2. The rider was only going at his tired and exhausted @NUM3. I think that if he didn’t get to the old building he wouldn’t have made it the entire way. Riding along the riders mood I thought was confidence followed by determination and relief. To ride in conditions like that you need to be able to push yourself as far as possible to get where you want to go."	10838	
7839	3	"The cyclist had to endure carry roads, hills probably to steep to go without a can and huge @CAPS1 @CAPS2 rattle snakes. The carry roads are dangerous because time on most raring bife, don't have grip. The hills are hard, unless you have a life with years."	10839	
7840	3	"The setting in the short story “Rough @CAPS1 Ahead” greatly affected the cyclist because the hot day, the terrain changing envirment, and the fact that he was running out of water supply. He started off with the advice of old men. They told he of a short cut to where he was headed and he, of coarse, took their advice with a smile. He did not for tell of the terrain. It became rough with hills and not only did that wear him out, but the heat was unbearable. He says “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly, and I was traveling through high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This quote tells the reader his water was depleting and since he is in the desert, it would be hard to find water and shade. The rider made it through, but with a close encounter of dieing of heatstroke."	10840	
7841	3	"The photograph that was taken for  the essay that I read show some resemblance to what I imagined. It shows someone on a bike, alone, no water or anyone around. Sun bright & not a cloud in sight. The essays tells about how the author takes directions from a group of old men who haven’t left their porch in a long time. When he reaches to where he lives going he brakes a promise to himself that he will read the map & not take directions from old men who seem to be wise."	10841	
7842	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in both positive and negative ways. The story tells of him getting advice from old wise men in the area. At first it is posotive but then things change for the worst. When he reaches his destination the well wasn’t working and when it did the water tasted like battery acid. Things only get worse for the weary cyclist. His water supply soon runs out and now he highly doubts that the wise men were right.	10842	
7843	3	"The features of the setting, makes the cyclist feel confident about the next morning. At the beginning of the essay, the author talked to older men. The author said, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off to was I would come to a long this breezy jaunt.” The men were so sure and it had the author to be confident about the next morning. He was confident when he began his journey. The author said, “Things began well enough.” Up to this point, he still believed in what the old men told him."	10843	
7844	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a rough and invigercting way. The cyclist was travelling through the California deserts. The desert was very hot and very though to get through. The cyclist had taken advice from an older group of people who’s advice was out of date because if it was up to date the cyclist wouldn’t be in this kind of despair. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing relication that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off the porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” (@CAPS1 pg @NUM1). He is very exausted from dehydration and wishes he'd never took that advice from some out of date gentlemen. The features of the setting had greatly affected the cyclist in a lot of ways including mentally anf physically.  "	10844	
7845	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist for example, the scene of one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule…” was the cause of the cyclist’s first loss of hope. The run down scenery and the lack of good drinking water from pipes probably left the cyclist feeling deserted in a ghost town- like shortcut to Yosemite. Another example was when the cyclist was not two miles into the next section and he noticed the terrain was changing from flat roads to short, rolling hills and tumble weeds with the addition of a rather larger snake. The most desperating example was the Welch’s Grape Juice factory the cyclist comes upon” Gary and @PERSON1’s Fish camp,” where he quenches his thirst in the settings of a rather modern bathroom”."	10845	
7846	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he let the old redgers peek at his map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning he followed their advice and launched out at first sight @NUM1 a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from his ride to Yosemite National Park."	10846	
7847	3	the features of the setting effects the cyclest because the setting was a desert with no food or water. He listned to A old man who said go the shortcut way but the shortcut way went over hills for about @NUM1 miles.   	10847	
7848	3	The setting of the story effects the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways the setting affects him is when the sun was begging to beat down” he would of been dyhydrated faster but he “basly noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 way that the setting affected him is when he was when he came up to abondon factor and saw the sign at the kid drinking the grape juice he got more tired and dehydrated.	10848	
7849	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by it being so hot he got and without water he got dehydrated. In the passage it said that @CAPS1 eased past tryng to take	10849	
7850	3	"Each feature of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative or positive way. The feature of the setting was desert. The cyclist was a little discouraged by the ""battery acid, but he believed he could continue on."" In the text it stated that the cyclist thought to himself, ""I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so - a test of my inner spirit."" This means he spirts were broken but he could continue. The next feature of the setting he encountered was rolling hills. I can’t infer from the way he talks that he was getting discourage and ready to give. I can infer that the hills were doing that to him because he kept having negative thought. For instance he said ""keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" @CAPS1 thought could discourage anyone last feature of setting became to after losing hop was a fishing store. This store gave him hope he could make it because he got water and was rehydrated and wasn’t riding alone with no one insight."	10850	
7851	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects Joe Kurmaskie, the author and main character of the essay. When travelling from @ORGANIZATION1 in the middle of @DATE1, Joe quickly realizes that the advice he received was faulty and out of date. The terrain and environments he enters matters it that much more difficult. In the beginning, Joe was optimistic stating “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rusting rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” Joe accepts the first fault of the old men and continues on. Later on, the heat and lack of water make him sarcastic and bitter when he states,i had been bittingmy water bottles pretty regularly,and i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” Joe becomes impatient and thirsty after the first two towns he came upon were lacking any source of good water. He later restorts to  ''breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Joe kurmaskie uses his surroundings to aid him there. The settings of the essay affect him on his travels through the California desert by giving him will power as well as by deteriorating his strength."	10851	
7852	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The cyclist was, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This made the cyclist even more thirsty, especially since he was out of water. Also, at one of the stops, snakes and the tumble weeds had crossed his path. The cyclist was, “trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state,” so the snake wouldn’t attack him. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was that near the end of his trip, he had to travel over many hills. At this point, the cyclist was already exhausted and thirsty, and the hills made him work even harder. Therefore, the setting in this story affects the cyclist in a few ways."	10852	
7853	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” greatly affect the cyclist. One way the features affect the cyclist is the heat. If it wasn’t so hot, the cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so desperately dehydrated. The author says, “I could drop of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” It took ?? on a hot summer day in the mid west. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was how desolate the setting was. He says, “On that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town since everywhere was deserted as wouldn’t find a place where he could get water. It seemed like he was in a place that had no people in it. The features of the setting in this story have direct effect on the thirst of the cyclist."	10853	
7854	3	"From the descriptive account of a long ride to Yosemite, the speaker gets his point across well of his despair. As he recounts the hot, sweaty day of June, he includes words that create a mood of desperation and determination. The setting explains hes feeling of abandonment, noting the first “town” as being a “ghost town”. Describing the day as being so hot and unbearable, he explains that the flat hills changed to rolling hills, in which he saw tumbleweeds and a diamondback. He used words such as “eased” as he went carefully moved it in his “dehydrated state”. Because the setting was now hills, he has much more strain to get up them and notes one hill as being “crippling” and “long”. He even was at the point of feeling as though he were going to die, and quoted as saying “the birds were going to pick my bones clean”. After describing his long, desperate journey, he shows extreme relief of obtaining water after his long, summer journey."	10854	
7855	3	"The dangerous features of the setting cause the cyclist to first doubt the advice given to him, then almost reach despair and contemplate his death. One example of the dangerous terrain was the diamond back snake blocking, “the majority of the pavement,” at one point in the road. The cyclist avoids it, worried that he might disturb it accidentally because of his dehydration. At this time in the story, the author is already wondering if he took a wrong turn, and the dangerous snake only adds to his distress. Another example of the setting’s effect on the cyclist was his dehydration throughout the story. He bikes across miles of desert with only a little water, expecting that he will have the opportunity to replenish it along the way. Instead, he comes across broken pumps at abandoned settlements. Dehydration is an athlete’s primary concern in every sport because it causes heatstroke and death very quickly. When the author realizes he might die, he begins to contemplate his death, saying to himself, “I was going to die and birds would pick me clean” In conclusion, the dangerous setting causes the authors doubt, despair, and morbid thoughts."	10855	
7856	3	"She features of the setting affect the cyclists moods throughout the story. When the cyclist starts his journey he thanks of the setting in yosemite national park, his observation This makes him glad and he procedes on his journey. When he comes to the field go hot town'' he laughs and is still in the good spirits. Then he comes to the ramshakle shed'' and the fewer that'' couldnt hold the lamest mule. ''The author days this sight was troubling . ''now he is beginning to question his advice of the old when. When the tenana become tougher he gets deaned because he is cumming out of water. When he reaches the next town he gets made because it too seems dead arid own down, because the glope juice factory is no large cumming. now he is durken aged and he says ''hung my head.''  He gets what when he reaches me fish and tachle and gets water. That is here he harms his learn out to take could old advice from old men. "	10856	
7857	3	The cyclist is kind of an out sider to the town and he kind of know about it. In the town there are all theys old people liking here.	10857	
7858	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it is very warm. The ground is dry the air is wet and very hot. The ghost towns the fear of seeing things due to lack of water. The setting plays a big part in how he felt if he was near a grossy inhabited place he would have no worrys at all there probably would have been no story for the cyclist. The man is in the middle of no where with little to no water no one to talk to nothing to look at but the one winding road with no one or anything in site. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	10858	
7859	3	"The cyclist went through a tremendous journey by following the out-dated instructions of “Old – timers”. He encountered unwanted obstacles such as lack of water supply, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. And I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So obviously, water wasn’t the only issue met, but so was the unbearable sun, found in one of the warmest place in the @CAPS1.S during the hottest season! Next, he encountered a change of terrain.” He was in a state of dehydration the entire time, making matters worse, but with determination the cyclist treaded on, and finished his journey."	10859	
7860	3	"The cyclist is oveously inexperienced because he listened to “gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades."" He is on the edge of dehydration. When he writes “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."""	10860	
7861	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a bicyclist is given directions from a group of older men that puts him on the wrong track to his destination. “Things began well enough,” the author stated, but his day was soon to become quite arduous. The cyclist realized he was on a roundabout, deserted route and he was running out of water. Each town and structure the old men had described were now deserted. The author began with a sense of amusement at the old men’s in accuracy, but soon became troubled, as each of these towns were completely deserted, and he had been ""hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” These buildings became an embodiment of lost hope for the cyclist. Each one was empty and without any water. A sign, warning against high speeds, mocked the cyclist in his “dehydrated state.” The last structure an open fishing camp filled the author with relief, dispersing his fears of dehydration and sunstroke. The structures caused the cyclist to move from amusement to despair to relief as he traveled through the California deserts. I have never had the experience of being caught without water on a wilderness trek. I know how to use a map so I would not need directions. The cyclists two failures were that he was unconfident in his direction and he was unprepared for climate he was in. These two failures almost cost him his life, a situation I would never be caught in."	10861	
7862	3	The way the settings effected the cyclist was that it made it life threatening for him to get to Yosemite. One thing is got into from men who haven’t left there porch in @NUM1 yrs. Also didn’t bring enough water for the hot day and long trip and almost died because of it.	10862	
7863	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclis because when he ie talking to the old guy he said he’s dircetes but they are from when carter was in office. This is a prombile because there @MONTH1 have been house odd seen then and other thing  @MONTH1 be there or @MONTH1 be some of the thing in his drictions are not there any more. Then with the river he say was he so past to go across it or what and he got lost and them made his way out and was happy.	10863	
7864	3	The feature of the setting effect the cyclist in the response because  it was extremly hot oulside and the road was horrible. The cyclist had no water and the water he tried tasted like battery acid He road for miles tring to find the next town because he listen to two old men he had seen on a old house poish.	10864	
7865	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks that he is going to die of exhaustion. To start out the directions he was given, ended up taking him way longer when the cyclist then found water, it was disgusting. In the story, the cyclist says, “A tar like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. ”while the reader pumps out the water, he is convinced he can go a few more miles, so he leaves. He starts out on a flat road, but soon finds out the road becomes long and hilly. As the cyclist goes over the last hill, he sees a building, a juice building. He finds out the building is closed down and leaves. At the end he was told more directions but doesn’t take them knowing that it will do the same thing the last directions did for him, make the trip harder."	10865	
7866	3	"Well have the features if the setting affect the cyclist? Well, it affect the cyclist because when people are speding bike, motorcycle, scooters, and bikers you have to protection what I mean about that is that you have to wear a helmet all the time jus in case you fall. When, people riding bike they have a car just like when people driving cars, but instead they have to wear seatbelts, and watch there speed. It’s more difficult then riding a bike, bikes, don’t have that many lows. There’s to be a sign with a person riding a bike to let us be cautious like rider."	10866	
7867	3	"The features of the setting definitely affect the cyclist. I’m going to use “Do not Exceed Posted speed limit,” as an example the weather and temperature definitely affect the speed limit for example in the text it stated “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke.” another feature of the setting that would definatley affect the cyclist is the necessities like water. In the example text it says “ I had been hitting my water bottle pretty heavily through the desserts of california in June.’ make you have what you need for your trip and last but not least know what you trip is like before you go so that way you can plan ahead so the people around you also matter."	10867	
7868	3	"The features in the setting affect the author, in many ways. One reason is the sight of no people, building or cars, definetly affect the way the cyclist is feeling about traveling. Second, when he stopped at the store and the water was very hot, that is discouraging. This would affect him. Last when he was riding it felt like all desert and he had only drops of water left. Therefore, the features of the setting  definetly affect the cyclist in many ways."	10868	
7869	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First of all, the story said they were in the desert with rough roads, the desert, with a hot and dry climate, caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. The roads caused the cyclist to work harder to climb hills and ride through rough terrains. Also, the ghost towns affected the cyclist mentally. Whenever they would see a building he would get excited, however they were ghost towns, therefore he could not get water. All of the features of the setting affected him, and this can be seen when he said, “I hung my head.” This shows that he was discouraged. The features affected him greatly both physically and mentally."	10869	
7870	3	"In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting affects the cyclist. In the story its says the roads were bad, and there were snakes the on paths blocking the trail needed to take. If I was a cyclist I would have ask how long since he’s bin there and how bad is it and if he hasen’t bin there for a long time I would ask if he knows of someone else who knows the area to help me. If you go biking you should go prepares for anything."	10870	
7871	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. When the cyclist got directions, the men told him about a town he would come to first. The town wasn't like they described it. It looked like a ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This town gave the cyclist a chuckle as he thought about the quality how much water he drank compared to the conditions he was travelling in ""high desserts of California in June."" From this quote you can infer that the conditions affected his health, hydration, and down rough short hills, ""a building came into view."" This effected the cyclist's murdset. It gave him hope and relief. When he got to the building, it only left him with despair because it was an abandoned Welch's Grape juice factory and bottling plants. In conclusion, the settings, and conditions affected the cyclist mentally and physically."	10871	
7872	3	"The features of the setting that the cyclist was affected by was the heat, lack of water, and out dated information about towns of his way to Yosemite National Park the heat while he was traveling was extrem he was riding through a California desert in June, he was out of water and there was nowhere he could get more bEcause the closest towns were abandon."	10872	
7873	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the setting in many ways. The cyclist passed many towns, but they were “ghost towns.” There wasn’t any water nearby, so the cyclist could refill his water bottle and feel energized for the long trip. The text says, “Twenty miles up the road, came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” @CAPS1, the text says, “I was traveling through the high deserts in California in June.” @CAPS2 much water, the cyclist was losing energy and could get a heatstroke faster. Lastly, the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” which will make the cyclist tired. The setting affected the cyclist by making him tired, dehydrated, and lose his energy."	10873	
7874	3	"There are many features of the setting affect the cyclist. One thing affecting the cyclist is the heat. The ?? ?? in the middle of the dessert during the summer. These conditions would make any cyclist dehydrated in minutes. Another condition is his supply at water. This man is running and of water because there is no towns that can give him any water. The last feature is that he lost in the first place. He had gone by the way, he @MONTH1 have been passing by town preferringly."	10874	
7875	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way, is the old guys. They affected the cyclist because the first guy didn’t know anything and lead the cyclist in the wrong direction. The second old guy helped him out by having a map and showed him where Yosemite river was located. Also, the climate was very hot and that effected him because it caused him to get dehydrated. When your dehydrated you can die and it slows you down. Another thing is the water. He didn’t have enough so that he could get hydrated, but towards the end where the old guy was there was water and that helped him out because he ran out of his water and he needed some more, finally the way the roads were with the hills and everything effected him. This effected him because when you go down a hill on a bike its an advantage since your moving quicker without even doing anything. Going up hills was a disadvantage because it causes you to do more work pedaling. During the cyclsit journey he had many features of the setting that lead to disadvantage or advantages for him."	10875	
7876	3	"The features of the setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really affect the cyclist. The cyclist is in a campground and it is very dry so that affects his ability to get water so he gets a little dehydrated. For example in the story it says “I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spite you have left to circulate”. This shows that the cyclist was very thirsty. Also the terrain affects the cyclist because he has an encounter with what looked like a diamond back. This encounter could have killed the cyclist because diamond backs are poisoness. An example of this encounter is when it says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake –it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me”. The cyclist was very affected by the features of the setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”."	10876	
7877	3	"There are some ways in which the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The first feature the cyclist comes across is described as a “town”. The place seems like a once “triving little spot” that now fits the “traditional definition of a ghost town”This first featerleaves the biker chuckling but not feeling doubtful. Anotherer one of the special featers the cyclist crosses is an old Welch’s grape juice factory and bottleing plant. By now, the rider has used close to all of his water supply and has become incredibly dehydrated. After seeing abandoned factory and bottleing plant, the cyclist hangs his head in despair and seems to have lost all confidence.  These are two ways in which the cyclist is affected by the featers. "	10877	
7878	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by @PERSON1 the features of the setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically. The featured setting is described as “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,"" the landscape was hot, hilly and barren. These features affected the cyclist by making him tired going up the hills, dehydrating him from the heat and letting him not get any relief from the shade from the barrenness. The cyclist described the effects of the terrain like this, “wide rings dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. The setting affected the cyclist by draining him of the will to go on and physically draining him of water and strength. This is because the relentless sun, the lack of water and the horrie destert hills."	10878	
7879	3	In the essay the weather affects the person because if it snows he can’t ride and if it rains it make it harder to rid and if it is really hot then he could get dehidrated. Also if it is really windy the can get blown off of his bike . So as a conclusion the weather always affects him.	10879	
7880	3	The feature of the setting cast a dark cloud of bout on the cyclist. The extreme temperature drains all his energy out of him. Te lack of water takes everything else away.	10880	
7881	3	"Any features of setting can affect the cyclist because it can start to distract them. In the story, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the text explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.”"	10881	
7883	3	"There are many different problems that the cycler faces in the story. The first problem the cycler faced was that he had no water to drink, which caused him to be dehydrated throughput the day. Another problem the cyclist faces is when the speed limit was reduced due to the conditions of the road. This delayed the time the cycler had to get to the park. A final example from the text would be when the sun’s rays were beating down on the cyclist, causing him to almost have, as quoted in the story, “a heatstroke” These examples of setting affect the cycler in a big way."	10883	
7884	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist is affected by the setting around him. The main character goes for a bike ride to a national park and gets directions for a shortcut by some old guys who’s information is out of date. The cyclist goes out on his journey and knows somethings wrong when the second “town” he comes to is a ghost town just like the first one. The narrator says, “There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (Kurmaskie). He knows he is in danger because there is no place for water and it is hot in the desert. In the story the cyclist is faste with problems from the surrounding settings."	10884

7886	3	"In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the man realized that you should not take advice from strangers. He depended on old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. He found out that it is not safe to depend on them for directions because you will end up like he did, without water. Now yes, these old men did not want him to end up like this, they just had not been over that way in such a long time to know that the town does not exist anymore. This man also learned to always be prepared of bring extra water with you on a long bike trip in a place that is low in population. In the end, he though he was not going to survive because he did not have a large amount of water supple with him for the journey."	10886	
7887	3	"In this story these was some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature was the sun as he was riding it says, “The sun was beginning to to beat down” (kumaskie). With the sun beating down on him he kept riding, but it was making him tired some features of the setting where he was going also affected him. It gave him the push to keep riding. He was going to Yosemite National Park. It says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). That means that he was going to keep pushing until he got their and that is how that affected him."	10887	
7888	3	"The setting of the essay greatly affected the plot of the story. The high deserts of California sets the scene of the story to be a dry hot day. Several feartures of this landscape contribute to the conflicts confronted by the cyclist. The greatest problem that faced the cyclist was the lack of water. This left the cyclist with then fear of getting dehydration or heat stroke. For example, the cyclist said. “growing realization that l could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This demonstrats his fear of dying from lack of water. @CAPS1, his lack of water is futher shown through his episode at the old @ORGANIZATION1. At the factory, he finds a picture of a young boy drinking @ORGANIZATION2’s Juice to which he find ironic. He said when he got back on his bike that.” I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth helps take your mind of thirst by allowing spit to circulate.” This illustrates his drastic need for water. Another feature that the cyclist approached was the heat. The high desert of California are known for being very, very hot areas. The cyclist believed that heatstroke would kill him and that he would be left out there because of twoold men. The heat is illustrated. When the cyclist says, ""Wide rings of isolated sweat circle my shirt."" @CAPS1, when he says, ""shows that the heat was blazing o him and showing him down. This is similar to an episode of someone lost in the desert. The same conflicts would be encounter and the same thought would be going their heads."	10888	
7889	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie setting play a huge part in what happened to the cyclist. The story took place in the desert of California in June. This area was not known to the cyclist so he took advice from the local men. Because he didn't know the area better he trusted them. Once he started out the heat and exercise made him very thirsty so he drank a lot of his water, upon coming to the first ""town"" he was to pass he learned it was deserted and hadn’t any water supply. After passing similar “towns” Joe became dehydrated since it was desert like conditions. If the story had be set in a populated rainy road the cyclist would never had faced these issues, but because it was an abandoned road without water the cyclist almost died from lack of water. “Who hadn’t with the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” thinking he had a town ahead with water available."	10889	
7890	3	"The setting of the story effects the cyclist because the setting is whats happening around the cyclist and is something that effects the character, for example if its raining and the roads are slipery the author wont be able to go cycling, another example is the road the road is bad it could get the cyclist hurt. The setting very inpotant to a story."	10890	
7891	3	"In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the author in cycling trip to Yosemite National Park. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” reads paragraph @NUM1, and “I had been hitting the water bottles pretty regularly. Throughout the piece, it is the cyclist’s lack of water that creates problems for him. The length of his ride (made longer try the, to quote the words, “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride,” given to him try some elderly men whose information was out of date) and the weather on a “gorgeous day in June” cause him to realize that he could “drop from heatstroke.” The author travels over @NUM2 miles during his trip, as “the sun heat down” and he tranverse desert roads frequently try tumbleweeds and huge snakes. Every building and town he passes is abandoned, and so he as nowhere to refill his rapidly draining water supply. He also has to “take on @NUM3 small rolling hills” as well as “one long, crippling hill.” The rough terrain and his speed, a “water-depleting 12 mph,” reads the text, cause him to become dehydrated and despairing. He is thirsty, sweaty, and tired. Finally, in the end of the story, he comes across a campground store, and is able to refill his water bottles and rest, recovering from his trip’s ill effects.   "	10891	
7892	3	"The settings could affect the cyclist in many ways. He was alone so he would start talking to himself. It was very hot so he would need to drink water, he could also get heatstroke."	10892	
7893	3	"The setting of “Rough Road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit” affect the cyclist in many different ways, one is the extreme heat he says hes in the high desert which. Would be really hot, setting afects him by making the road rough, like the title says “Rough Road.” The “crippling Hill” in the setting would also affect the cyclist in his trip. This is how the setting is affecting the cyclist in the story."	10893	
7894	3	The setting of where the cyclist was riding was affecting the cyclist. The rocky road make the bike riding harder because of the bumps and then that lodged a rock in his throat. Rolling hills forced him to go up hills and make him tired. When he got to a town there was no one in it so he couldn’t get help from anyone or even get a drink. Then the snake forced the cyclist to go around him and use more energy. Then when the cyclist had to go through the hot deserts there was no water. Finally when he thought that was a building he used all of his energy to get there. It turns out that it was just a Grape Welch @CAPS1- making Factory. All of these settings and events affected the cyclist.	10894	
7895	3	"The cyclist was headed for a park with lots of shade and water. The information the cyclist recieved from the old men was out of date so the cyclist didn’t make it to the park. The cyclist was expecting shade and cold running water but got desert, a tumblewood and no water. The cyclist was disapointed. The cyclist thought that he was going to die. The cyclist was dehidrated and thought that he was hallucinating. The setting that the cyclist was in gave the cyclist no hope at reaching the park. The desert only made the cyclist run out of water faster. The heat made the cyclist think that he was hallucinating. The setting really effected the cyclist in a bad way.  "	10895	
7896	3	"The features of the setting in “ Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effected the cyclist in this story. The setting of the story is on a lifeless plain, with nothing or no one anywhere in sight. The only thing around the cyclist was land and hills. For example, a line from the story is: “At some point, a tumbleweed crossed my path.” @CAPS1, in movies, tumbleweed is used to show the viewers how lonely and desperate the characters are. Just like in movies, the tumbleweed shows how lonely the cyclist is. Another part of the setting that affected the cyclist was the “Flat road, replaced by rolling hills.” The rolling hills made the cyclist more desperate because of the extra work, but also made the cyclist more determined to succeed, which he did. The setting of the story obviously helped, and hurt the cyclist in a variety of ways."	10896	
7897	3	"Features of this setting affect the cyclist because all of his surroundings are very dry and there are no cars or other cyclist’s on the road.  This affects the cyclist because he is very dehydrated and feels like he is going to have a heat stroke. The cyclist @MONTH1 not get to Yosemite National Park. Tumbleweeds and a snake also affect the setting because it shows you that he is seriously in a very dry desert with no water and barely surviving, but still having determination to get to where he has got to go. “I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh” That sentence gives an example of how the motorcyclist wasn’t giving up because he was almost out of all hope, but he still managed to laugh at himself instead of breaking down and the only thought crossing his mind was “I’m going to die.”"	10897	
7898	3	"The cyclist accepted information from old timers that have been on their porch since Carter was in office.He regretted taking this information from them shortly after.He was going through bad condition of weather and harsh roads.He had no water,to drink and he almost died.His determination is what cared him from the incident.He would never take advice from an old timer again"	10898	
7899	3	"A lot of the things effect the cyclist. First thing is, water the lack of water can cause dehydration if you go a very long time without anything to drink you could die from dehydration. In the story the boy doesn’t have any water. The hills could slightly be dangerous as well could wreck over a big rock. Any animal that has poisines bite would hot be okay as well and the conditions of the road."	10899	
7900	3	"Features from the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. During his journey he faced problems. He faced problems like the condition of the the road. The roads he took were all messed up. He could barely ride through them, also when he got tired, he barely had water. All this affected him because his journey didn’t go all that well. The road conditions were horrible and he could barely ride through them."	10900	
7901	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist has a very challenging journey to reach his destination of Yosemite. The setting features caused many problems for him to overcome. After about @NUM1 miles of biking, the cyclist reaches “one ram shake shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” He attempts to receive some water from a pump, but nothing other than tar like substance and b brackish water tasting of battery acid exits the pump. This causes a problem of dehydration. The cyclist has so much water with him and he is in a hot climate (“the high deserts of California in June”). He has no other source of water and he needs to keep hydrated. Then he reaches a highway sign that says, “ROUGH @CAPS1 AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The posted speed was 55 mph and the cyclist was strainfully proceeding at 12 mph. His next hurdle to jump, was a large snake, he thought possibly to be a diamond back. It laid in his path so he had to use his strength to keep balance and make way around it. After he makes his way over a hill, he sees a building that he makes sure is not a mirage. Thankfully it’s not, but on thankfully it’s an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1 factory. So, the setting proved to be very difficult for him."	10901	
7902	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot desert with no water and the road was in bad condition. Since he was in the desert with no water, he could have died from heatstroke at any time. Also the roads were rocky so it must have been very difficult to try to ride your bike on. Things were not going to well for the cyclist in this setting."	10902	
7903	3	Setting  in a book can and is very important it sometimes help you understood the matenol better usually a setting in a book helps make the story and the scenes that are in it. In my own comen it helps me visualize what going on and helps me it I dont understand everyone has there own way of ready but im my opinion I think the setting is a very imponont part of the book as a learnig material.	10903	
7904	3	"Crippling hill, tumbleweeds, horizon-all are how the feature of the setting affect the cyclist. First, crippling hill reveals that he has to use all of his strength and endureance to go up the hill. He was dehydrated from not having any water at all, so it was going to be painful. Second, tumbleweeds. This mirrors things such as heat. For example, in movies and cartoons they mostly show tumbleweeds in deserts, or places it is hot, this mode is his heat and sweat, plus dehydration. Last, horizon. this reveals how tired the cyclist was. He kept staring at the horizon. He felt farther and farther away from his destination he wanted to get however most of it was because he was tired, thirsty, and hot. He was afraid he would have a heat stroke and possibly even die before he ever made it. In conclusion, crippling hills, tumble weeds and the horizon, all are how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	10904	
7905	3	When you ride while you have to been aware of all of your surroundings appear and something like that. When on the bike welch been reached soever bruises and cars at the most	10905	
7906	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in various ways. When the cyclist first starts his bike ride in the morning, it is still cool outside and the sun isn’t as bright.as the day proceeds, it gets hotter, and the byclist faces some problems. He doesn’t have enough water and must find a town. The town he arrives at first does not have any good water. The byclist has to then find another town. as he is riding his bike, the road is full of hills. Then the byclist runs in to a snake."	10906	
7907	3	The features of the setting after the cyclist in many ways. The first way is its not and ?? even more thirsty. The second way is there is no water around so he ?? to act weak. Thethird way is the road is ?? and there is no one to be found to help him.	10907	
7908	3	"The features of the setting very much affects the cyclist. As the cyclist continues to travel on his bike through. The deserts of California, his water supply is quickly depleted. In desperation for water, the cyclist explains, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" From this statement, it is evident that the cyclist is being immensely affected by the heat of the desert. He is probably dehydrated and close to fainting. In addition to the heat of the desert, the treacherous terrain also takes its tole on the cyclist. Climbing the hilly roads requires more effort than riding on flat roads. As a result, the cyclist needs more water to accomadate his dehydration. His overall situation is worsened by the features of the setting."	10908	
7909	3	"It is hard for cycleis because they have to go through a lot of riding bikes. sometime with out even geting a drink each mile seeing dealy anmials left and right, sometimes they lose there wind and have to stop for a amount of time so they will not past out on the hot steamy road. They be going for at least @NUM1 miles and some times more so bikers be doing a lot of stuff during there race."	10909	
7910	3	"In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist has many problems because of where it is token place. Their are many examples on how the setting affected the cyclist. One sentence in the story that shows that is, “At the same point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This shows that the tumble weed and large snake affected the cyclist because I could of fallen and got hurt badly. This why in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie show how the setting affected the cyclist."	10910	
7911	3	"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. They provided him with more obstacles than he was expecting, First, in the essay, the cyclist comes across a chage in the terrain. It changed from flar road, to short rolling hlls. This was hard for the cyclist:- because it was going to take up more energy. Another feature that affect the cyclsit was the temperature. It was very hot in the places he was pedaling through. He said, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" This shows that he is hot and in need of cool water. Last, the most difficult feature was the lack of water. He was traveling through the desert without enough water. This feature depressed him more thatn anything. There, when he finally found water, he ""drank deeply from the sink."" He was very relieved that be lived through the experience. Therefore, those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist the most."	10911	
7912	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First and fore most the water supply is extremely low and limited. Then, there is the factor of wheather being very hot and de hydrating the rider."	10912	
7913	3	"In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist faces a lot of problems. After getting advice from a couple of “old timers,” he sets out on a so called “shortcut.” @CAPS1 of the places he ends up travelling through are old, abandoned and dried up. The cyclist faces problems with lack of water, dry heat, a rough road and a couple of abandoned buildings. Not to mention a snake crossing his path. After all of this, he had had about enough when he found a bait shop. “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, and kiss them…” (Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) He was very greatful and decided to use his map after that."	10913	
7914	3	If the cyclist were not in these conditions he would not have hear as many problems. His main problem was water. He couldn’t get water any where because he was in the middle of no where. The sun was very hot and bright that day making him even more thirsty. Also the rolling of up and down hills made him dehydrated. If he did not listen to the old men he wouldn’t have been in the situation.	10914	
7915	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character, the cyclist is biking all the way to Yosemite National park. On his way he receives advice on a “shortcut” from a few older men. When he sets back off on to the road he is driving in a desert, These features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. The intense heat of the desert causes the cyclist to become dehydrated. Because he is in a desert, there are no buildings or homes. This deprives the cyclist of his water supply as well. The setting affects the cyclist horribly in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	10915	
7916	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist runs out of water while riding to the town. Another thing that affects the cyclist is that the old men gave him wrong directions and the cyclist didn’t know until he got to a town that people told him the right directions. Also, the cyclist has to ride through @NUM1 degree wheather to get to his place that he wants to go to. These are the features of the setting that affects the cyclist."	10916	
7917	3	In the story Rough road ahead by @PERSON1 the setting made it harder for cyclists. The swirvy roads and hills made it difficult for cyclist to get though. Also the heat and lack of water can effect cyclists. The author mentioned heat stroke as a posability. That occurs with heat and lack of water. That is how the turain can effect cyclist.	10917	
7918	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he sees no buildings or lifeform around he becomes scared and alone. He feels as if he won’t make it through the trip and that there is no hope left. When he sees the first ""town"" he mocks at it because he thinks this will be the only thing wrong with the old mens directions. But as time goes on he sees that the mens directions are out-of-date  and have led him astray. This affects him because he now becomes scared that he will not find his destination and will die out in the desert instead. He feels is hopeless when he comes to the abandoned Juice factory because he was so thirsty and he thought maybe his problems were solved when he saw the building but it just turned out to be a dissapointment. Finally when he comes to the fish camp he is excited and relived because he found a modern building and water."	10918	
7919	3	"The features of the setting ?? the cyclist by the weather, time of year, and where he was cycling. An example that is in the text is At some point tumble weeds, crossed my path cinclol nediculously large snake it blocked the majority of the determent in front of me."	10919	
7920	3	"The features of the setting play a big part in determining the attitude of the cyclist. When at first he begins his trip, the mild scenery makes him comfortable, and even the sight of a ghost town does not really bother him, but when he reaches on abandoned shed and some rusty pumps that do not work, he becomes troubled because he is beginning to run low on water. Later on, the sight of a road sign that warns of rough terrain makes him nervous that he will not be able to make it across the terrain with the small water supply he has left. When he reaches an abandoned grape juice factory, he feels almost as though he is being taunted, because there is a photo of a boy drinking juice on the building. This sight makes him become almost completely hopeless, and he beging to believe that he will die. Throughout his journey the barren landscape and lack of any stream also depletes his spirits, so that by the time he finds the fishing shop by the road he is so hopeless that the simple sight of the shop relieves him immensely and gives him hope and absolute joy."	10920	
7921	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by him being worryful because he was in a desert in summer with little water. He recieved “shortcut” directions from some old men and he took this “shortcut.” “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” This quote means he was drinking his water fast and had little water left, and he was in a hot desert in a hot place (@LOCATION1) in the summer, a hot month. This answers the question because it shows how he put himself in a bad situation, and how he regrets it, and how he is beginning to run low on supplies and getting woryful over his shortage of supplies."	10921	
7922	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He had many obstacles to overcome because he took the wrong path. One thing that affected the cyclist was the heat. It was so hot when he was riding that he was getting weak and tired. He was also getting very dehydrated. Another thing that affected the cyclist was having no water supply. This also could be the cause of dehydration because he was so thirsty. The roads were also very dangerous. One road was flat and smooth, then the next road was bumpy and had rolling hills. Also the snake that he passed was dangerous because if it would have bit him, nobody would have been able to help him. These things affected the cyclist in many ways. It tested his strength and ability to do anything."	10922	
7923	3	The features of the settings affected the cyclist was now not outside it was. The setting was outside on a not day riding a bike. An example that shows it was hot was when the cyclist said “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” That proves how the setting affected the cyclists behavior. 	10923	
7924	3	"There are a few crucial factors in a cyclist. Your bike, your ability, and your surroundings. In the story the cyclist surroundings set the stage for heat related problems. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This heat can be unbearable and cause you to die of dehydration or a heat stroke."	10924	
7925	3	"The Features of the settings affected the cyclist alot. First the cyclist stopped For directions and asked older men, which led him into the harsh climate. The cyclist was confronted with trying to @CAPS1 water in the middle of nowhere, he runs into towns and A Factory but No water there He runs into Hills and roads that are hard on him and @CAPS2 his bike. Finally he @CAPS1 a store that sells bait and uses The water From The sink in the bathroom. In conclusion the cyclist will probably never ask older men For directions again."	10925	
7926	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist’s preformance .If there are hills, curves and sharp turns it could change their speed and endurance. For example the text states, ""The speed limit was 55 mph I was doing a water deplecting 12 mph.”(kurmashie). This showing speed can effet the ability to ride the bicycle."	10926	
7927	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist harshly. The setting was in the high deserts of California and it was the hottest part of the year. He was in the middle of nowhere and towns were miles apart. The cyclist needed water but had no place to get the water. He was hot, and sweating, and getting no water into his body caused him to start dehydrating. The setting also made him start to not believe in himself, which caused despair. He did come across an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory, but that had closed down years before. There wasn’t anything to drink there. When the cyclist got back on to his bike, he thought he was going to die and picked clean the waiting vultures. This make me think of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION2 where what seems like hundreds of cyclist ride for miles through @LOCATION2."	10927	
7928	3	"I think a response that explains how how the features of the setting affect the cyclist is, he really didn’t want to go on that ride because he “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” With age comes wisdom and all that, but world is a fluid place. And what I think he met by that is that he didn’t know what to do because he has never took advice from anyone on traveling and he wasn’t sure if he had wanted to do it or not so he had to go with whatever he thought was best for him to do. Since they sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out land marks and spouting off towns then he said he would have come to along this breezy sound which means what he think that he could make it in a good time and it would be a very good seing for him to go on.    "	10928	
7929	3	"I think up in the mountains was a very hot place to be, and he was thirsty. It says that the tar like substances oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling some when. litle @NUM1 degrees. He said he tried so and it tasted like battery acid. Right there he was thirsty and tired. He was planning a diamond back when he tried to keep his balance in his dehydrated state. I could only imagine how he feels and looks out this point. He said “with my last burst of energy, I maneuvered downhill.” @CAPS1 is gonna stop him from going down. Finally he got to where he was going but he was exhausted, but he made it to Yosemite, safe and sound.   "	10929	
7930	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead : Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist tremendously. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the warm temperature. The temperature affects the cyclist because it causes him to need water more then he usually would if it were a cooler day out. “the sun was beginning to beatdown” (@NUM1). The temperature affects him so much as to be very cautious of his water supply, so he makes it last. The second features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the rolling hills. The rolling hills are a nuisance to him and also are a sign to him he is going the wrong way. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The hills affect the biker by causing him to be more tired and use more water, which he would not have to consume as much if the road were flatter and again the day cooler. The third feature affecting the biker, which started this whole mess of a journey were the old men, who gave him the short-cut directions. “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2) If this feature did not exist in the essay, then the biker would have followed his own map and gotten to Yosemite, without any problems. In conclusion, these three features affect the cyclist tremendously."	10930	
7931	3	"Where the cyclist is cycling, there was no water for miles in the heat. For example, “I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” At this point the speaker is really dehydrated and in the middle of no-where barely moving along. Another example is “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” Going cycling at the hottest time of the year in the really hot climated state of California is hard by itself, but the speaker is also traveling through a really rough desert. This causes the cyclist to go unciouncious and almost suffer heatstroke due to dehydration at such a hard time and place"	10931	
7932	3	"The features of te setting affect the cyclist in all ways possible. This man said he was going through the toughest places in California which is got to be hard the text states, “and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That biker has got to be sweating like a pig and really tired if he’s at cycling in the deserts. Also if the places is really dead a cyclist @MONTH1 not be able to find water, which could lead to dehydration. The text states, “and the ?? realization that I could drop from heat store  gorgeous day. (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The heat is unreal and could make a man faint. It all depends where a cyclist is biking for the best results in the end"	10932	
7933	3	The setting cyclist by first givin’ the wrong directions. Also the cyclist had gone a long time without water. The sun makes it even more difficult for the cyclist. But the cyclist dont give up.	10933	
7934	3	"A cyclist can be pushed to the limit of the place there riding at has a lot of hills or it very cold, or even very hot. This could affect the cyclists performance very much. If a hill is long he might not have the leg strength. On it is cold the cyclist might not have the best lung capacity.Animals can also be an issue. In the story “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit snakes are an issue to the cyclist.” A ridiculously large snake it really did look lilke a diamond back-block the majority of the pavement in fron of me”. This is what Joe Kurmaskie said in this story. He was riding his through to rough trail when he saw this snake. “Over one long, cripping hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage”. This is what hills can do to a cyclists. They can make him weary and see things sometimes."	10934	
7935	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the fact that the sun was beating down on him and he was running out of water. Another effect on the cyclist was that he was hot and began losing energy.	10935	
7936	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Posted,” the setting greatly effected the cyclist. First of all, in the beginning, he was at a campsite he said to be serean. The fact that it’s calm would push him to trust the “wise old men” he had betalking with. After hitting the road, the setting became more and more abandoned roads and desert. He soon feels regret of asking for “a shortcut” and begins to feel as if he’s going to die. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean….” Of course, if you’re biking alone in a desert, with few sips of water to spare, you’re going to feel like all hope is lost. And that’s exactly how he felt. At the end of the story, he feels relief finding a little bait shop with cold water. “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait...”"	10936	
7937	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in a few ways. The setting affects how long the cyclist takes to get to the next town. The setting of the essay is really hot and arid. The roads are trecrous and hilly, on conditions like that take the cyclist longer to get to his destination and gives him a lack of energy which he needs to get there. It affects the time because if the terrain is less vigorous and more straight, less hilly then obviously it would take them less time and he would be less tired."	10937

IT WAS LIKE A DESERT,HUT AND @LOCATION1.WHENEVER HE WOULD COME ACROSS A TOWN, HE DESCRIBED IT AS GHOSTTOWN.HE WAS DEHYDRATED AT AN ALARMING RATE AND HE DOES FIND WATER HE DESCRIBED AS TARLIKE SUBSTANCE AT A TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT @NUM1 AND WOULD NOT COOL DOWN.HE EVEN HAD ANIMALS THAT WERE DANGEROUS TO A BIKE RIDEN.LIKE SNAKES, WHICH HE THOUGHT TO BE A DIMONDBACK,WHICH CAN BE DEADLY IF BITTING. BESIDES THE TERRAIN BEING DESERT IT WAS PRETTY FLAT TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN TURNS INTO ROLLING HILLS, HILLS TAKE UR MORE ENERGY AND MAKES THE CYCLIST TIRED FASTER. ALL IN ALL THIS CYCLIST IS ADETERMINED ONE AND OVERCOME ANYTHING THAT COMES HIS WAY,MAN-MADE AND NATURE, HE FACES THE ELEMENTS PRETTY MUCH.THIS CYCLIST GIVES NEW MEANING SAVING LIFE SUCKS, EVEN WHEN THINGS ARE BAD, NEVER GIVE UP."	10939	
7940	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclists very much. At first he found the pines, and rivers very pleasant. This setting probably made him feel delighted and full of happiness. Later in the essay he describes the dry hot day that included short rolling hills he had to overcome. This setting probably made the author feel exsusted and filled with a bit of doubt but somehow he convinced himself he could continue his journey."	10940	
7941	3	"The narrator hadn’t a lot of water. So when the setting went from being in the cool woods to being in the desert with the bailing sun. He wasn’t feeling to great. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Hills for a cyclist are very hard as it is. But with not having that much water. And the water you have is really hot. It would make your journey a lot harder."	10941	
7942	3	"The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting. The first obstacle he encountered was that he started running out of water. He tried to pump out water, however, as stated in the text, “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by blackish water” He was unable to get any clean cool water, which later caused him to get dehydrated. Another obstacle he encountered was a rough road. The road had tumbleweeds and a snake, and was not a safe place for him to be. He then saw an old grape juice making building, which he got excited over. Unfortunatley, a little the building had been abandoned so he still wasn’t able to get anything to drink. By the time he actually reached a town he was worn out, hot, and dehydrated."	10942	
7943	3	"The story, ”Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by @PERSON1, different features make it hard for a cyclist features like when its hot and you have no water and hills. When it is hot cyclists need water so they have the energy to bike long ways. The cyclist says, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This quote proves the cyclist is dehydrated and is having trouble fiding by not having balance. That proves he needed water. Once the terrain changed and went to hills all the energy he had left from the dehydration had to be used. He needed water desperately and the hills would make it longer and tiring. “I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” This quote proves he is going up a hill and doubt is in his mind that he wont make it up. This shows if there were not a hill he would have made it. Both dehydration and hills affected the cyclist. Make sure to take both those features into consideration before riding "	10943	
7944	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist. The cyclist would have been okay if there were people, building, cars, or something of human living in sight, he wouldn’t have been so terrified. The bumpy, unpared like roads were in more condition he would have not had to be more cautions on where his bike tires were rolling over. They lack of water and no palce to quench his thiest was making him devastated. The features of the setting effected the cyclist."	10944	
7945	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gets him exhausted and dehydrated. The setting in this story is in a desert like area, hot climate, bumpy roads, big hills, and nothing around. The hot climate and big hills made him dehydrated. The cyclist couldn’t stop for water or to get something to drink anywhere. There wasn’t a building insite. In the story the cyclist says. “There was no one in site, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This statement is a reason of why the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	10945	
7946	3	"Well the setting that affects the cyclist is the road because if there is not a good road, he can’t even drive his bicycle, also can be by the water, if he feels thirsty and there is not water, he can’t keep doing, what he was doing. The condition of the road is very important also we can talk about the  climax. Well there is  many conditions that can destroy a person.  "	10946	
7947	3	"The features in the setting effect the cyclist because It is Dry, @CAPS1, and @PERSON1, because the cyclist said, It was June in California and there water was @CAPS1, he also said he was sweating."	10947	
7948	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist, faces many challenges while riding through the California desert. In the story, the cyclist has a limited water supply. The setting affects this because he cannot stop for water easily. In fact, Kurmaskie fears death from dehydration. Also, the change of terrain from flat plains to rolling hills had an effect. Kurmaskie had to use more energy, and with limited water, this largely depleted his energy. The dry, hot desert setting largely affected Kurmaskie in this essay."	10948	
7950	3	"The weather affect cyclist’s performance. For example if its cool and sunny the cyclist would do better than if it was raining and humid. “The sun was begining to beat down, but I barely noticed it,” this weather is good for cycling. Also the condition of the road plays a part. “Flat road way replaced by short, rolling hills.” Flat roads are easier to ride than going up and down on hills. If a cyclist isn’t hydrated than they would be likely to collapse from dehydration or heatstroke. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” because the cyclist was so dehydrated on a hot day he could have fallen off the bike in the middle of the desert. The time of the year is a factor. If you ride in @DATE1 you’ll freeze while if you ride during the summer you have the risk of dehydration."	10950	
7951	3	"The elements that the cyclists faced seemed more strenuous then the path the old men took. The cyclist almost died due to the horrific elements. That day it was very hot and the path they took consisted of large rolling hills. He almost ran out of water due to the lack of stream or water stops. He also encountered snakes and thick brush. The naration states, ""over one long, crippling hill a buildings hill a building came into view(Kurmaskie @NUM1).This had been the hardest ride ever taken. By having to take these great obstacles it drained all the energy out of his body. Finally, because it was hot it made him sweat more and use water which was lacking."	10951	
7952	3	"The unrelenting heat, the lack of water and the absence of any sign of civilization along his try left the cyclist in a precarious situation that @MONTH1 have resulted in his death. It was an extremly hot day, and the cyclist was sweating continously. The heat began to make him feel sick and dehydrated as he continued in the trip. Also, the lack of water turned the situation to dangerous for the cyclist. He could not find a healthy water source, so he began to fear for his life. He knew that if he did not reach a town that was inhabited and had water  soon, he was going to be in trouble. Along the road he was riding, there were no streams or rivers to be found; it was purely desert. The lack of civilization along the road scared the cyclist and made the trip very eeric for him. He felt helplessly alone and knew that it anything were to happen to him none would know until too late. The setting made the cyclist overheated, thirsty, and desperately alone. As he went from deserted town to deserted town he became more and more worried. His only hope was a water pump located at one of the short towns, but that was only filled with brackish water that was undrinkable. These features would cause dishness and scare anyone in the same situation    "	10952	
7953	3	"The features in the setting, that affect the cyclist are the heat, roads, deserted towns, and the animals. The heat affects the cyclist because he starts to run out of water and realizes that he, “could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He runs out of water and every place he comes to is a deserted town. Therefore, he can not refill his water, which greatly affects him. The roads affect him because they are bumpy and consist of many hills. The cyclist is tired and thirsty all ready, and going up all of those hills doesn’t help brighten his spirits at all. The animals affect him as well because he sees a snake which makes him realize he could die and the birds and other animals would pick him apart. This makes him even more tired, upset, and nervous, and pessmistic about his journey because he now wants to die, because he doesn’t think he can make it to his destination any way. This relates to some cyclists who @MONTH1 do a marathon because they feel it @MONTH1 never be over and run out of hope, just as the cyclist did in the story."	10953	
7954	3	"In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the setting really affected the cyclist because since it was so hot he was dehydrated and didn’t  think he was even going to make it to see tomorrow. As he was on his way to try to make it to Yosemite National Park he came across a lot of unfortanit events ariving to the first stop he clearly could see something was wrong when he was supposed to be in a “town"" and he arrived at a ""ghost town”. Moving on his water supply was running out and he felt as if it were @NUM1 degrees in the middle of June. As he was having a hard enough time he comes across a diamondback snake, but avoids it. Just when he thought there wasnt any hope for him at all he saw a camp ahead sign. As he rushed he got there and got water was okay. Now he is aware not to trust men who don’t know what they are talking about."	10954	
7955	3	"Take a shortcut, prepared, connation or the road; - these are all things that affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite national park. He tried to take a shortcut that slow him away hours from his ride, he was prepared, when he arrived to the first town, more like a ghost town, he checked his water supply and moved on. The condition of the road was also not to good. He traveled through one section where flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After he had crested the first few of those, a large highway signs jumped out at him. It read: rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. These are some things that affected the cyclist during his journey."	10955	
7956	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the environment is very hot and dry it immediately makes him thirsty such as “The sun beating down” and tumble weeds, and snakes, and ghost towns were very symbolic of a stereotypical desert. The rolling hills in the text also give a sense of despair because if you were very tired and have to go a long way, then hills would only add to the aggravation. Also he describes the horizon that he could see far away with no sign of relief. Probably what made him the most thirsty was the false hope he was seein twice, both the water pump and the abandoned factory made him give his hopes up that soon his thirst would end, only to have his hopes of relief crushed and forcing him to travel many more distance even for hope of water."	10956	
7957	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces a number of troubles with the environment he is in. First off it is very hot outside and he is riding a bike. Because of this he has no way to cod himself down and is constantly getting hotter because he is having to pedel his bike. Also the cyclist only has a limited amount of water so the energy he has already exhasted he can not get back. The second thing that troubles him is the fact he does not know the area. Even though he had a map he decided to get advice from an old man. Because of this he ends up getting lost and almost ends up dying. Lastly the setting is in a desert. Because he has only limited amounts of water and no way of coding himself down, it makes it extremely dangerous for him to be in a unknown area to him. These three things all create a problem for the cyclists in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	10957	
7958	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist started out he was fine, but then he came to the first town. The cyclist said it was like a “ghost town”. After a while, he “came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” This scenery troubled the cyclist.Everthing  there was in bad shape and it worrie the cyclist because this was supposed to be a “shortcut”. The water there was bad, so he didn’t refill his water supply. After a while the terrain changed to “rolling hills.” The cyclist was running out of water and the hills would dehydrate him more and use more of his energy. After that, he found a empty factory that only increased his despair and anxiety, but once he left there he found a sign that said “GARY AND @PERSON1’S @CAPS1 CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES WE'RE YOUR BEST BET?!” This sign gave him hope because it meant his-salvation from the hot weather and his dehydration."	10958	
7959	3	"The cyclist face many obstacles in his cycling. There was the rough roads, the lack of water, and curved roads. In the story quote, “ I believe was my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill.” This explains the hill hand some turns on it. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other obstacles was water he had a small amount of water. In the story quote, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing spit you have left to circulate.” These are @NUM2 of @NUM3 obstacles the cyclist had to face on his bike ride."	10959	
7960	3	"The features of the setting have varied effects on the cyclist. Early on in his bike ride, he disregards the hot sun because he’s thinking about cool pines and rushing rivers.” a little while into the ride, a deserted town with a disfuntional water pump makes him start to worry a little about his water supply. When he comes to a rougher part of the road and sees a potentially poisonous snake, he’s really noticing the heat and lack of water, so he feels hopeless. The old grape juice factory with the picture of the boy drinking makes the cyclist feel that seeing the situation is ironic. Finally, when he sees the sign for the “fish camp”, he forgets about all the heat and anxitey over lack of water, probably because he knows he’s closer to a modern town and can replenish his water supply."	10960	
7961	3	"In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in a big way. If the setting is very bad the cyclist cannot do very well. If the setting is very good with smooth roads and very flat surfaces, the cyclist will be able to do a lot better. The story states that “@NUM1 miles up the road, I came to a fore of sorts”. This is a bad setting because the cyclist could get lost."	10961	
7962	3	"The features in the setting of this story have several different effects on the cyclist. The effect I think has the most on the cyclist is depleting her determination. In the story it says that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 your biking and the terrain changes the hills it make the going alot harder and makes you want to give up. The text also says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When there is nothing in sight it makes you feel alone and that your nowhere close to getting out of where you are and this feeling makes your determination to keep going deplete very fast. The last thing that the text says that would deplete a persons determination is the word sandblast.If your in a place that can sandblast a wall it makes you want to lie down and give up. All three of these examples from the text would deplete anyones determination pretty quickly along with many other things."	10962	
7963	3	In the story the cyclist goes through a different mood changes during this story. These mood changes are different for each setting the character was in. In the beginning of the bike ride the cyclist comes to an abandoned town and her mood was still in high spirits and she kept going on. After each time the character would arrive in a new place her cheerful mood would diminish more and a fear of dehydration and more sadness would move in. An example of this would be when the cyclist saw the sign that said rough road ahead and showed the speed limit. Finaly the cyclist comes to a bait shop and the mood changes again because she has more hope now and gets he cheerful mood back. Then the cyclist is able to move on.	10963	
7964	3	"First off, the cyclist was in the high deserts of California, in June. This would make it very hot while he was riding. Also, along the way, he encounters a rough road. This slows him down a little. Lastly after he finds out the grape juice factory is abandoned, he picks up a few pebbles and puts them in his mouth. Sucking on pebbles takes your mind off thirst. To conclude, some feature of the setting helped., and some did the opposite."	10964	
7965	3	"On his journey, the cyclist ran into many difficult features such as a snake, mirage, water shortage, hills and bumpy roads."" a large highway, sign jumped at me. it read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED SPEED LIMIT."" The cyclist was very tired and dehydrated. He even lost hope at one point. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” The cyclist had a very tough journey, only because he took advice from old men. A snake also made it difficult for him, “crossed my path and a ridiculously, large snake – it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The cyclist had many difficulties on his way to Yosemite National Park."	10965	
7966	3	"Setting is a major factor in this story. Firstly, the narrator is traveling in a desert that is very important because the heat (and also likely the changes of the air), caused him to thirst more. Another element of the setting is how everything is very old. Had the cyclist come to a prosperous town and a fuctioning factory, he would have not had the same problem of running out of water. Finally, the aspect of setting that include the fact that it is the way to Yosemite helps the speakzer’s determination."	10966	
7967	3	"The features of the setting and surrounding area mainly affect the cyclist. For example if you became thirsty, you would get your cantine for a sip out nothings in it. So your first move would be searching for a drinking hole. Without anything but your spit you would most likely dehydrate possibly causing death. Therefor this is why your features of the setting affect cyclists."	10967	
7968	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” add to the difficulty of his trip. For example, the author writes “by the looks of it- had been a @ORGANIZATION1 factory…a picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice…” This quote described the building he saw that he thought he could get help at. The picture he saw of the boy was almost teasing him. He desperately needed water, but he could not find it. Also in the story, the author writes “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” At this point in the journey, he needs water and he feels like he is never going to find it. He feels like his journey will never end. Lastly the author says “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” He almost couldn’t take the heat or hills or dehydration at this point and almost collapsed right there. As you can see, the setting of the story played a big role in the difficulty of his trip."	10968	
7969	3	"Because of the conditions of the setting, it harshly affected the cyclist. The day was in June in California. It was so hot, and the author quotes, “so hot I could drop from heat stroke.” He had to have been out of breath and energy with temperatures like this. It made it even harder because he only had a few sips left in his bothe. The cyclist was riding on, “short, rolling hills, (@NUM1)"", which made his journey even harder. There were also tumble weeds (@NUM2) that could have been tumbling, and got in his way. To make these conditions and worse, there was a, “large snake that took up the majority of the road.” (@NUM2) This means that he would have to ride around the snake, still hoping that he wouldn’t have bitten him. Therefore, because of the conditions and the obsticals that they created, the conditions of the cyclists journey were poor."	10969	
7970	3	"The feature of setting describe the cyclist’s journey you can tell that was peaceful and serene. For example, it was talking about how there were no people or buildings in sight just him and the road. It must be peaceful to just ride along by yourself just enjoying the scenery it’s probably beautiful."	10970	
7971	3	"The features of the setting in @PERSON1’s “Rough Road Ahead ” greatly affect the cyclist. He has a lot of strenuous work to do, under the harsh conditions of “the high deserts of California in June.” The temperature is very high and the cyclist has a limited supply of water. With a very hot temperature, it is very easy for the body to get dehydrated. If the body gets too dehydrated, many health problems could occur. The hot desert terrain had a definite effect on the cyclist’s health."	10971	
7972	3	"To be a cyclist you have to endure a lot of hard work and be full of confidence and determination. There are different challenges to face at all the different locations a cyclist would go The setting plays a large roll on the cyclist. Depending on the strength and mind set of the cyclist, difficulties won’t seem so difficult. The setting can vary, the roads could be long and smooth or hilly and windy. The climate could be cold, hot, or humid. The surroundings could be dangerous with lots of hills, animals, vehicles, or mountains. A good cyclist, would be able to ignore the setting and only focus on the confidence and determination of completing the journey. One who conqueors all challenges of the mind will be able to overcome all the struggles of surroundings. Just as in the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limits” by Joe Kurmaskie. “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly.” The need for water is very important as well. But if the determination to finish is there, then a cyclist or anyone that is, could accomplish and overcome a mountain set in their path."	10972	
7973	3	"The text supports the fact that the cyclsit was riding through a setting which effected him for the worsen. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California. I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening"" The author starts out by telling us were the cyclsit is (Lodi, California). We can assume that, since the cyclsit is in California, it is going to be fairly hot. ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclsit is now worried about his water consumption since he is in a California desert in June, which is a very hot time of the year to be biking in the desert so the cyclsit is now hot and runnig out of water which will soon lead to dehydration. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June"" We now know that the conditions of the setting are bad enough that the cyclsit is already suferring from dehydration and is now fearing heatstroke. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" The author now paints the setting as being a hoplessly empty desset with no form of hep. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die"" The cyclsit was now facing dehyration, possible heatstroke, and the hopless fealings of near death. The cyclist was put in a setting which effected him in one of the worst ways possible."	10973	
7974	3	The cyclist toore him through a shortcut that was to slice away hours from his ride to Yosemite National Park. When landmark and sporting was pointing out a breezy jaunt. The setting affect was miss leading.	10974	
7975	3	"At the start of the trip, after he had received the directions, he started out rather pleased and without worry, as the setting he was in wasn’t causing him any problems. By the time he reached the first town, it had become very hot, but it didn’t really affect him, as he had plenty of water. By the time he arrived at the second check point, however, he was beginning to get worried. It was getting extremely hot, and he was starting to run out of water. There were water pumps at the checkpoint, but none with water that could quench his thirst. He continued on the blazing day, but he eventually reached some hills that took even more energy to get across. At this point, he was extremely low on water, and he was beginning to worry that he would not survive the trip. Eventually, he reached the next “town” which turned out to be another abandoned building. This abandoned building however, turned out to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which depressed him even more, as if he had arrived a few years earlier, when it appeared to have been open, he finally would have heard a place to rest and get his energy back. He got back on his bike, but in desperation, he started sucking on rocks in hopes of getting some spit to circulate. However he didn’t believe it would be enough, as he thought that the heat and lack of water around him would kill him. However, he finally arrived at a bait shop where he was finally able to get some water causing all his worries to go away. "	10975	
7976	3	"The cyclist in the story had to face many hardships while cycling on the road. He cycled in the high deserts of California, where there is little water and rough terrain. The setting directly affects the cyclist by almost having him die of a heatstroke."	10976	
7977	3	"The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. It seemed like the setting was trying to harm him. The setting had a huge affect because at every point in his journey there was a problem that affected him negatively physically and/or mentally. For example when a snake, which was part of the set, was in the way, mentally he had to stay calm and go around, and physically he had to be slow and careful. In the quote i will use it describes the rough terrain he is on ""...I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This quote describes the setting as first being nice, then affecting him by changing and making him work harder. The cyclist already is tired and thirsty and the change of terrain affected him mentally and physically. Mentally he thought he would die, and physically it affected him for the worse with a lot of pain."	10977	
7978	3	"When a person sets off to circle they usually know about the many things that could affect him while riding. One thing that affects the cycler is the terrain they have to ride through. For example in the text,” Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, it says “Flat roads replaced by short, rolling hills”. The author is clearly telling how the terrain changes a lot when you ride. Another thing that affects the cycler is the heat they have to go through. For example in the text it states, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it”. The author is clearly stating that the heat affects the cycler when they ride, making it harder or easier for them. The last thing that affects the cycler is the distance that they must endure. In the text it states,”I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine”. The author is stating that the cycler was trying to go and by calculating distance, the cycler an improve time and the way they travel."	10978	
7979	3	"The cyclist in this essay faced many obstacles, both physical and mental, during his ride. Although not every place featured an obstacle; at a reservoir campground in California he “enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening” This implies that he was at place there and he enjoyed the nice evening there. This made him very content in the present before taking off. During the ride he had, “strong legs and a smile on (my) face,"" indicating his happiness at the beginning. When he chuckled at seeing the “ghost town” it shows that he was still happy. The “cool pines and rushing rivers” made his ride more enjoyable, when he got the water pump and “(the water) had the flavor of battery acid,” his trip seemed to get a little worse. He was filled with determination, however, at his lack of water. The “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously huge smoke” were some of the obstacles he faced that affected the mood of his journey, turning it from happy to a little stressed out. His “sad, hopeless lough” showed that he was losing his determination. The irony of the building made him upset because, “I hung my head.”"	10979	
7980	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The heat being the main factor, affected him the most. “The sun was beginning to beat down”.as it said in the essay. This added to his thirst and the heat made him un comfortable. Next, the cyclist is on a journey through a series of deserted towns. This affects him because he can’t ask for directions, help, food or water. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the tradition and definition of ghost town” is what the cyclist described it as. Soon, the cyclist came across hills making his journey more tiring. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June”, was how he described his reaction to the change in his effort to get up the hills. The setting very much affects the cyclist in this story, making his journey to Yosemite national park more pentious"	10980	
7981	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit, ” the cyclist is affected a great deal by the setting or enviroment. Through her long journey in California, the cyclist has a low supply of water after drinking it regulary. The story mentions that the cyclist is riding through “high deserts of California in June” by reading this sentence, anyone could point out that it must be teribblle hot. As soon as the cyclist thinks she has found water, it must be discouraging to find out that it is brackish. The crippling hills and tumbleweeds must also make the cyclist feel as if they are lost forever. The cyclist is affected majorly by the setting.   "	10981

7984	3	"The affect of the cyclist is he was far from the nearest town lack of water and tired. When you are cycling for a long time you get tired, thirst, and you are aching in your legs. And you surranded by desert and dangerous animals no civilization. So you can’t get directions"	10984	
7985	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist alot. In the essay the setting is a road surrounded by nothing and its realy hot. In the essay the cyclist had a lack of water and since it was hot out side this affected the cyclist thirst. Also since there was nothing around he had n were to go for help. 	10985	
7986	3	"he features of the setting affect the cyclist. The rocky terrain makes pedaling difficult, thus sustanance, in the form of water, is needed. For the majority of the passage, the author is riding through desert country. The sun beating down on an active body is sure to create an effect. As said “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high desserts of California. Also, the wildlife plays a role in the setting of an area. “ I toiled on. At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback_blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me….” @CAPS1 this trip he had faced many dangers; wild life, dehydration and muscle strain to name a few. This shows that one must be prepared for all situations and that preparing for the climate you are headed to is important. "	10986	
7987	3	"The cyclist overcomes many harsh times in his journey to Yosemite. He overcomes them by never quitting and not let things get to him which he did very well. The group of old men gave bad directions but it will all pay off in the end for him to survive. This is the moral to the story, never quit."	10987	
7988	3	"The features of the setting affect the way the cyclist feels and causes his determination to grow stronger. For example, the author writes, “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regulary, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June... telling myself that if i colud make it that far, i’d be fine.” This shows that although the cyclist is discouraged by the sight of the dry desert, he is determined to keep going in order to survive."	10988	
7989	3	"As the cyclist goes on, he loses more and more hope. The settings of the story add to this loss of hope. First, he is arrived at the @NUM1 town, which was basically a “ghost town”. This abandoned town made him doubtful, because the old men called this dump, a town. Then, he came along a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral” which made him lose hope. The first mistake of the ‘town’ could have been a slip of the mind, but a so called landmark being abandoned had to be a mistake in their, directions. When he saw the speed limit sign that said hot to go above @NUM2 drained the last of his hope. He was going @NUM3, which made him feel like he wasn’t doing good enough. The setting not only affected the cyclist, but affected him badly."	10989	
7990	3	"Many settings affect the feeling a person has on a bike ride. The narrators ride started out on a flat road knowing about the town and confident in himself. When he reached the town it was abandoned, a “ghost town.” This did not discourage him as the next one wasn’t too far away and he still had a decent supply  water. When he came to the sork and found the rundown off farm, he got worried as he was running out of water. But not to worried the next town wasn’t too far away. The narrator says, “I could make it” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is still not discouraged. He then came upon rolling hills. After one such hill he came upon another abandoned building. He got really discouraged but continued any way. The narrator says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving…a diary with the last entry in praise of old men”(Kurmaskie). He is unbelieving that he will survive. All of a sudden he approaches a bait shop and his troubles are over. However another old man asks if he needs help, this time he knows to not take directions."	10990	
7991	3	"The veins began to change as the cycleist ran out of water, he was going to have to ride up and down hills while dehidrated the rider thout of it as a challenge and keept riding on."	10991	
7992	3	"The cyclist in the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit’ is greatly affected by the setting. In this case the setting changed the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay. Towards the beginning of the essay, the mood of the cyclist is humorous. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”… I chuckled.” The setting of the “ ghost town” made the cyclist chuckle, which made his mood become amusing. In the essay the cyclist describes a new setting, “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path….” The tumbleweeds affected the cyclist’s mood imensly. The reader can tell that he is tired and loosing hope by this point and the tumbleweeds suggest this. However, this hope is quickly restored when the cyclist notices a building. “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view.” When the setting changed from nothing to a building, the cyclist’s mood changes from hopless to hopeful. Clearly, the setting affects the cyclist’s mood."	10992	
7993	3	The setting of the essay was out in the country side. The setting being in the middle of nowhere started to scare the cyclist because the cyclist wanted water so he started to get very frightened.	10993	
7994	3	the features of the setting affeact the cyclist because told himself that he would never take advice from older people again cause he does not like the directions the give him. 	10994	
7995	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist very badly to get where he is trying to go because when the cyclist is out of water he keeps on riding very thirsty to the grape juice factory and sees a boy on abig bullitin board drinking juice and that would affect him by thirst and dehydration for water. Also, the snakes slow him down because they could bite him on the way to where he’s going, the conditions of the rode slow him down and makes him really tired so that also affects him. Finally, the hills he rides slows him down and makes him more tired and more thirsty so that all affects him pretty badly. In conclusion, it sucks with all the problems he faced but where he was going was more important to him than to be dead in the desert."	10995	
7996	3	"In the essay the “.Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”, experienced many problems when it came to his travels. In the essay the author show the codgers his map and they give him advise that would save him time in his travel to Yosemite National Park. Hearing their advise the author took the shortcut it started off well but it gradually got worse. Slowly he started to ride through the desert. Dehydrated the author continued down the shortcut. By great luck he found a juice bottling company but it was shut down. To take his mind off his dehydration the author stuck rocks in his mouth, shortly later he found a bait shop and drank from the sink exactly. After this twist of fate he swore he would follow his map in the future."	10996	
7997	3	"Many things especially setting can affect a cyclist. One being the sun. Another is the terrain. And lastly the town and buildings. The sun affects a cyclist by making him dehydrated. It can also make you hot and sweaty. For example the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The terrain is the land. The terrain can make it difficult for a cyclist to ride. If he’s going on hills and rough rocky roads it will tire him out. An example of the hills being a bad affect is when the author said, “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. The last affect is the buildings and the town. This affected his mood. This could affect him because if he gets depressed he might not continue. His mood changed from hopeful to depressed when he saw what looked like a juice factory. The author said, “In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading, this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of if had been a @ORGANIZATION1 factory and bottling plant. In conclusion many things can affect a cyclist. Including terrain, the sun and the buildings."	10997	
7998	3	The features of the setting effect the cycolist in the way. The dry hot desert made him hot man and thirsty. Also th fait that he could not see any thing made him hopeless.	10998	
7999	3	"In the story the cyclist starts his journey feeling confident about the tripple has embraced on, but with every few miles he covers he finds himself in more and more of a hopeless situation. First he comes to an abondened “Ghost town”. He then finds himself in the middle of the californian desert at a fork in the road, all the while he is loosing hope and water. There are few run down buildings and some dried up water pumps. Then ironicly he comes to an abandoned @CAPS1’s juice factory. Just when it seems that all hope is lost he crest's the last hill and finds “Gary and @CAPS2” bait and tackle shop. Feeling very released, and rehydrated, he finally buys a map."	10999	
8000	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. With the snakes and endurance needed not that many people can go throug something like this. If you were on a bike ride for @NUM1 miles you would have to know what your doing befor you start. Also seing poisonius snakes would be discouraging because you could get you mind set on thing that could happen if you get bit by one and take your mind of things that are infront of you. Last on bike rides you need to have water to get your body going and going to a pump with out water could play mindgames with you. These are how the setting could have affected the cyclist.	11000	
8001	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist multiple times throughout the story. For example, since the story takes place in California in June the reader can infer it is going to be hot. During the cyclist’s ride he becomes very hot and is consuming water quickley. The heat played a major role and was a factor that definatly affected the cyclist. Also, the setting of this story was back roads and small towns, if the story took place somewhere like a city for instance the cyclist would never be far from other people. Finally, the setting was unfamiliar to the cyclist which affected the bike ride, because if man knew the area he could have known better than to follow certain paths. Therefore, the features of the setting such as the location, time of year, remoteness of the area, and the unfamiliar ness of the area all affected the cyclist."	11001	
8002	3	"In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist. By the rolling hills, not have enough water the snakes. In the story the features had endless hills and heat to ?? riding up and down the hills caused him to loose a lot of his energy. By the time he got to the second town he was out of water and tired. However he received a boost of energy and made it to a place to get water yet still tired. Just these things caused problems. Along with these things came head, snakes, rough roads, and low speed. So as you can see the cyclist had lots of problems from listening to the old men. However he made it to a place were he could get more water and had more energy to go on."	11002	
8003	3	"The cyclist had faced a few problems in his story. First he came to a stranded gas station where there was water, but it was extremly hot and tasted like battery acid. Then he came up the hills that were very challenging and there were snakes in the load. He was very dehydrated and could’ve passed out. He sacked on some stones to get his spit circulating and he managed to find a bathroom when he drank out of the lime."	11003	
8004	3	"Hot, lack of water, hills- all are reasons why the setting affects the author. It was very hot in the desert he said it felt like it was @NUM1 degrees outside and that started to wear him out. He started to ran out of water and that’s not good. If he runs out of water in over @NUM2 degree weather he could die. Hes riding his bike in the desert and going up hills. That would wear any biker out. He also passed a snake by which kind of freaked him out."	11004	
8005	3	"In the essay “Do not Exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature in the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. In this passage the cyclist had gone on a bike trip on a hot day during June to @LOCATION1 in California. The cyclist decided to go on a shortcut given to them by older people so they didn’t bring as much water because they thought there were going to be stops. Each time the cyclist arrived at a stop, though, all the towns were old and rundown with no water sources. This was very difficult on the cyclist,” It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The cyclist was so thirsty that they really thought they were going to die until they reached a rest stop,” as I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and by some bait-any bait, even though I didn'y own a rod or reel"". The cyclist shows their anger throughout the entire passage to the older men because when they were younger the towns were probably not rundown and they probably had good water sources, but that was not the case. The cyclist had to struggle the steep hills, the heat, rundown buildings, and wildlife of California with out water. If the day was cooler maybe the author wouldn't of thought as badly to older people."	11005	
8006	3	I think they effected the riders in both a good way and a bad way because for one the riders could be enjoying the scenery while at the same time being burned by the sun and there legs become weak from pedlinge	11006	
8007	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time On his journey because of how much the setting affected him. Because of the heat, and lack of water made him realize “that I could drop from heatstroke.” Because of his lack of energy and dehydration, it made it much harder to pedal, especially up and down the hills."	11007	
8008	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by it was very hot, no rest stops and he wasn’t getting a lot of shade. All those things affected him because he was lacking water, so if it is very hot then you need to stay hidrated and he was not. There were no rest stops so he was tired and again could not refill water or get any so that affected him. There was no shade and since there was no shade he had the sun beating down on him making dehidrated."	11008	
8009	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist's detemenation. From the start the cyclist faced rough terrain, and a scarse amount of water supply. With each a turn came most strength and determination to seek relief of thirst. From the rattling  of snakes to the sucking of stones the cyclist determination rose, “some how, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices,” the cyclist started. With his strength and determination he was able to over come the let downs he faced from the wrong directions he received. Therefore, from the grooling mours of peddling up hills, and sucking of stones to quench his thirst he found relief while also relizing to not give up, when faced with life's downs. Remembering, all along that with downs comes the ups of life."	11009	
8010	3	"Out on the road, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making it harder on him. One feature that affects him is the hilly terrain and bad road conditions. This is mentioned when he says, ""with what I thought was my last bait of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” @CAPS1 factor which depleted his energy is the lack of places to stop for water. We know this because he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" The third factor that depletes his energy is the hot sun, ”feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of @NUM1 degrees.” This are the factors which lead he to believe it was hard on the cyclist."	11010	
8011	3	"In this story the cyclist takes some very out dated directions from some old men who he says ""haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" The hot summer and desert landscap affected the cyclist a great deal. For a while he was sure he was going to die from lack of water. When he first saw a building he rubbed his eyes just to make sure it wasn’t a mirage but didn’t get his hopes up. Arriveing at the building he quickly noticed it had been abandond many years before and there was no water to be found. When he finaly came opon a store that was not abondond he ran into the bathroom and drank water from the sink. He was so happy he even said he would by bait from them even though he had no pole. By this you can tell that the cyclist really needed this water bad.  "	11011	
8012	3	"In the article “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” some features in the setting affected his travels the first one that comes to mind is not a physical aspect, but a mental one, and in this case is him being over confident in what he does, and how he does it. This was his first mistake because he thought he had more strength and knowledge, and once he found out, it was too late to go back and fix it. Another obstacle was the physical issues, including the road conditions, predators, and the lack of necessaties. Already being stressed and tired, I’m sure the bumpy, hilly road was just an aggravation he felt like was causing more of an issue than it Should’ve been. Then there was the snake which was fearful and also streeful, especially when trying  to accomplish a challenge. Lostly, probably being the toughest aspect was the lack of water. Overworking, and being hot is one thing, but not having water is just another problem he had in itself. In conclusion, these were a few aspects that become @CAPS1 and affected this cyclists ride."	11012	
8013	3	"In this story the cyclist was affected by the setting in a couple ways. First, the roads were in bad condition so he had trouble riding. Second, he almost ran over a @CAPS1 back snake. At lastly he was really dehydratd from the heat. This was what affected the cyclist."	11013	
8014	3	"In the story the features affected the cyclist by nearly rolling him. He first rode off in the morning thinking he could tackle the world and “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile” on his face. When it started to get hot he planned to stop and refill his water because he said, “I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly... traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When he ran out of water and the sun was beating down he couldn’t find any water, and the barren dry road almost killed him because of dehydration. The faetures of the setting caused him to go from excited straight to despair due to the lack of water and heat. He said, “I was going to die and the birdswould pick me clean”(Kurmaskie @NUM2). He started out thinking he would have a easy, relaxing day but because he diden’t know his setting very well it almost killed him."	11014	
8015	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it did not explain everything we need to road. It task about one thing than another. It realy got of the setting but then it got right to the point the more I read the more I understood	11015	
8016	3	The setting surely affect the cyclist. First of all it is hot and its rough road. It’s so hot that he needed lots of water to drink. I even encountered a snake in the rough road. It’s also a rough road it’s hard to pedal in a rough road. It requires a great amount of energy to get across a rough road. That’s why the setting affect the cyclist because it’s hot and it’s a rough road.	11016	
8017	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist was affected by the settings she headed into. The first setting was a, “traditional definition of a ghost town” (pharagraph @NUM1). Because this was the first stop she still had hope. As the cyclist rode on she started to run out of water. Her second step was full of “several rusty pipes,” which hot water with the “flavor of battery acid” came out of. The cyclist started to get more and more desperate"	11017	
8018	3	"The world war had just passed and it was in the middle of June and in @LOCATION1. These settings is what mainly affected the cyclist. Also, the fact that he had only a certain amount of water and it tasted like nothing but old batter acid. He had been hulosanating juice factories and water stops that weren’t actually there he felt as if he was going to have a heart stroke, then pass out and die. Incase he died, he left a diary filled with many entries of and about his journey from lod, California to yoscimite, California this is the main feature of the settings that aaffected the cyclist"	11018	
8019	3	The setting for the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit”gose well with it.I say that because rod he was rideing the did she me how he was rideing it and where he was rideing out.Like when they said “Not two miles into this next section of the ride.”It juss put images in my head.Do you think that the sotry went with setting?	11019	
8020	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting is rather rough, and is explained in detail. In the essay the cyclist has trouble because of the height of the trail, and because of the rough terrain that he is riding on. He also doesn’t have water and encounter snakes. For example, when it says “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” this show you, just how difficult this kind of terrains, and what he has to deal with. Also, the setting is a very hot day. Not only does this make him hot, but it also is bad because he didn’t know that the trail was this long, so he is running low on water, and he thinks he might die of dehydration. When he says “I eased passed trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This show just how tired and weak he is. Overall the setting is rough and provides many obstacles that he must overcome in order to survive."	11020	
8021	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” by @PERSON1 the setting effects the cyclist. The setting effects the cyclest because he has rough roads, rolling hills, and no buildings in sight. He was out of water and with no one or stream in sight he couldent get any more water. I know this because in the text it says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” From this I no that he couldnt get water any thime soon. But I also know that he was he hehidrated by the text “In my dehydrated state.” This tells me he didint have any water. The setting effects the cyclest because he didnt have any were to get water.  "	11021	
8022	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist majorly because it was very hot. The narrator states, “The sun was beginning to beat down wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was so hot that he was sweating constantly. Another problem caused by the intence heat was a lacking water supply. The narrator states,” The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing drops’ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had been drinking his water regularly to help from dehydrating .He only had a little left and couldn’t  find more for a while. As the conditions of the road changed this also became a ploblem. The narrator states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The rolling hills become more work than the flat road, requiring more water."	11022	
8023	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist quite a bit. The setting is part of his conflict. Throughout his journey he is lacking water and can’t get more because the towns he is coming to are so vacuum. The first sight he comes to is an old shed and rusted pumps. For the cyclist, this sight is troubling.” He is trying to pump some water to quench his thirst, but had no much. He was only able to obtain something that tasted like battery acid. The next site wasn’t much better. He comes across an abandoned juice factory.” A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” This picture was taunting him with his thirst. He felt desperate. These setting are what gave him his challenge, and made his next sip of water so enjoyable. The cyclist’s journey wouldn’t have been the same without these settings"	11023	
8024	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. This is because he was traveling through high deserts. Now if you have ever been in the desert before, it is hard to bare the hot sun. The heat will mess with you mind. When you are almost out of water, that will get you down even more. Plus the thought of the old man lying about how for a stoping place is.   "	11024	
8025	3	"There were many features of the setting that effected the cyclest. I found three major features. A beating sun, a rough road ahead, and a crippling hill. This affected him by slowing him down. Those were features of the setting that effected the cyclest.  "	11025	
8026	3	"The setting has a major impact on a cyclist. One part of the setting would be steps; For example towns to take brakes. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author sees at town but it’s empty with no one to help him. He also must have a good water supply. When he stops at a water pump he wrote, “I pumped that handle for several minutes.” But since he didn’t get any water he put himself at risk for getting dehydrated. It is also harder for cyclist when there are hills in their path. Joe Kurmaskie wrote, “…with my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill”. Cyclist use more leg muscles when peddaling up hill, rather than flat land."	11026	
8027	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For instance, the lack of water could lead to a heat stroke. I knew someone who had to be put in a hospital because of that. There was a poisonous snake in the road, which he had to sneak by. At this location there wasn’t anyone or a town insight. That could be dangerous because if you needed help no one would be there for you. In some cases you should always carry enough water and necessary items with you while going biking or any other adventure."	11027	
8028	3	"Rough road ahead by @PERSON1 uses the setting affect to great adventage. It is used to which put you into the them and out, your almost this old one and also your reading you feel like your riding this the it say  tumbleweeds crossing path. You see alarge one passing while yours reaching the setting in the story is  hot dry and depassing. The lendless harzanad rough pebbly road   make your factory tartecycled. The hilly road gave up and doomed the dryed outing. All are used to the advantage, the setting used in this story put you in the mind and are so do so upto you can see what they are talking about. The story notes the tred and losing hope. He adles her in any him asper terror. It makes him keep going this not stoping untill he reaches the end he can’t cross. "	11028	
8029	3	"The features of the setting are the main the reason that the cyclist has trouble getting through the “shortcut”. He says that he was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” so it must have been very hot. This made him very thirsty, and he used up his water supply quickly. Because there were no people or buildings around, he couldn’t stop to fill his water or to rest. He says that in his journey the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This terrain must have been hard to ride on and probably depleted his energy faster. All of these things were obstacles he had to overcome in order to survive his trip."	11029	
8030	3	The features in the setting effected the cyclist in the story by Joe Kurmaskie. The land changed for pavement to dirt and hills and that can be challenging for a cyclist. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows that the land style changed and that it could have been hard to ride a bike on land like this. The setting changed throughout the story and it must have been hard for the cyclist to manovur from the different types of land he faced. This story sounds like it must have been hard to ride on many kinds of terrain seeing animals and having no water to help you in June in California.	11030	
8031	3	How the features affected the cyclist is sometimes bad sometimes good. Like when the whether was windy or rainy it slowed him down for example “This whether is slowing me down”. But if the whether was clear he could ride as fast as he wants and set not touched. This is how the features affected the cyclist.	11031	
8032	3	"The features of the setting affected him greatly because of the hot, June, @CAPS1 sun, “the crippling hill,” and the uneven pavement of the road. All these things affect him because are the sun can be dehydrating after a long time in it. The crippling hills and rough roads put more stress onto the situation, because they take energy and strength to do then. Once he got to the first town, he ran out of water and the well water was unfit to drink, and he was running out of water fast. After he realized he was running out of water he hit another obstacle and the road sign ahead said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limits.” This caused the preserving of water to be very tough. When he finally got to the last town with water, he didn’t know whether it was a mirage or real. In concluding, the climate had just affect on his bike ride."	11032	
8033	3	The features are that he won the race and the bike is very fast and has very good handling cause he allmost wreck but then he gained back control and won there race.	11033	
8034	3	"Much can be imagined about how the cyclist felt when he saw what was around him throughout his lost of way. After taking the wrong information of the old timers, Joe Kurmaskie must have finally known something, was wrong when he was ""traveling through the high deserts of California."" Joe was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. Joe described the part as cool pines and rushing rivers. Had Joe been in the right place seem enough, water shouldn’t have been a problem but where Joe was at, there were no rushing rivers to quench hist thirst or cool pines to let him know the temperature wasn’t high. "	11034	
8035	3	"The features of the setting, in the California deserts affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was happy and confident when he first started out. “Things began well enough, I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile into my face.” The cyclist was calm and confident in the beginning, “barely noticing the sun heating down,” Then the settings changes as the cyclist moves on. Not two miles into this next section…I noticed the terrain changing. The road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The cyclist was tired and thirsty. “ I toiled on, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He though about the bad things that could happened to him. “I could drop from heart stroke”. Then the cyclist glimsped a building. He was motivated a\t the thought of civilization, and retrieving his thirst, “ a building came into view… with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill.” The different setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was tired and thirsty when the sun “beat down” on him and also motivated when he saw a sign of civilization. Many people are affected by different setting like the cyclist was. People could feel happy on a beautiful sunny day sad on a gloomy and rainy day. Different settings have different affects on people."	11035	
8036	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the rusted water pump doesn’t give him any good drinking water. Then, the somewhat smooth terrain changed to rough terrain and the flat road changed to rolling hills, which makes cycling more difficult. He had to deal with all of this on a low water supply. It must have been challenging and upsetting for the cyclist to deal with the features of the setting in this situation."	11036	
8037	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways by being hot, and in the California desert. The cyclist saw a snake, which he thought was a diamond back. The cyclist was running out of water. There was nothing on the road or nothing to look at just tumble weeds and desert. He was getting dicouraged, but when he rounded the bend he saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. His aditude change then he was relvived. Settings can affect your mood and your body, if it was cooler he would have felt better, and if there was something to look at maybe he could have gotten his mind off of being thirsty."	11037	
8038	3	The setting affected the cyclist by slowing him down. What allowed him down was the heat in the rolling hills and the rough terrain. He got the directions from a set of old timers sitting on a porch. So the old times gave him bad directions. They caused him to run out of water and almost die. That is what slowed him down on his way Yosemite. 	11038	
8039	3	"Road conditions, deserted town, lack of water-all are components of the setting that affected the cyclist. The roads were very rough and bumpy, which made the cyclist tired. The fact that the cyclist was in a deserted town was crucial. This made it difficult for the cyclist because he had no help from people who were familiar with his surroundings. The lack of water made things very difficult for the cyclist. He was dehydrated and tired. All these conditions contributed to toughness."	11039	
8040	3	"One of the most important things that affected the cyclist was the features of the area he was cycling in. These features gave the cyclist both determination and hopelessness. In the beginning of the essay when the cyclist comes “to a fork of sorts” the sight/setting gives him a feeling of hopelessness and trouble. This was because he had been using his water bottles regularly yet the setting didn’t give him any hope of being able to refill his water bottles. The cyclist begins to feel an even greater feeling of hopelessness when he realizes that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure”. This setting makes the cyclist feel sad because he realizes that no one would likely find him/he find them before he gets sick from heatstroke. The one time that the author does feel determination is when he see’s “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp”. as soon as the camp come into the setting the cyclist realized he would be okay. In conclusion, the features of the setting throughout the essay give the cyclist a feeling of determination at some points while total hopelessness at others."	11040	
8041	3	"The setting in the story “@CAPS1’t exceed posted speed limit” is his biggest obstacle. For example he says he took information from ""old timers who haven’t left the porch since Carter was in office"", which means he is doubtful that he is even going the right way. Also he said he was in the desert area of California and running out of water. The water he did find tasted like battery acid. So he could die of dehydration. Furthermore, It was not only a desert in California but in the middle of June the hottest month. This shows that he could get heat stroke or pass out. In conclusion the setting is by far the biggest factor of a cyclist."	11041	
8042	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, it says, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. This causes there to be many hills for the cyclist to go up and down. He gets tired more as he goes on the hills. I know this because it says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill”, @CAPS1 the cyclist sees an old building which had been the @ORGANIZATION1 and all over sudden he becomes very thirsty. Lastly, was a stone that the cyclist found and he put it in his mouth so maybe it would help him not to be so thirsty."	11042	
8044	3	"The perfect setting for a cyclist would be perfect  flat roads. In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist encounters several surprising affects. The cyclist noticed a terrin changing, where the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. At some points in the essay, tumbleweeds affected the cyclists path as well. The  author described one part of the setting as a “ long crippling hill.” Some other  features which contribute to the cyclists’ setting were pebbles and rocks."	11044	
8045	3	"In the short story presented, the cyclist was faced with som big issues. The main one being that he was quickly running out of water and then there was the heat. All of this had a great effect on the cyclist. Since he was running out of water, he was becoming dehidrated. since it was hot, he was sweating, meaning that he needed to drink water that he didn’t have. All of this had great effects on the cyclist in the presented story."	11045	
8046	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, had a really big affect on the cyclist because he was out in the desert barly any water, the heat was very bad. There where animals, such as snakes around him. He got very dehidrated because of the weather and water. "	11046	
8047	3	The features of setting affected the cyclist because the dirt road made it harder and more tiring to pedal. Without water he was dihidrated and could barely move to were he wanted to go because of the weather being so hot.	11047	
8048	3	"The setting of the story have a major impact on the cyclist. Since he is in a hot region, he has to drink more water. There is also no fresh water around, which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated. The trip would have been completely different if the cyclist had been in a different setting, such as a cold region with freshwater streams and a higher population."	11048	
8049	3	I setting of the story has an effect on th cyclist. There was no water and the was riding and getting tired. There were hills to make the trip more existing. During the trip he ran in to a snake that blocked the way. Thats how the setting effects the rider.	11049	
8050	3	In this story has a good setting and good tone to it. The cyclist is at the old mens house getting ready to leave and the setting is very laid back and relaxed. As he startes out the cyclist tells you about all the tree’s and how he can hear the park calling his name. Then as he startes going over the mountains to the next town he becomes more unhappy and bitter. He is very thirsty and the heat is not helping at all. A lot of the time where ever the cyclist was at and how ever the setting was that’s how he acted.	11050	
8051	3	"During the cyclist long bike trip the setting plays a major key because of the weather or the heat. This cyclist had a hard time getting from his first checkpoint at the town which had barley any water and what they did have was crusty and oily. The towns setting slowed him down and weakened him and you can tell from the quote.” A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling a somewhere in the neighborhood of @NUM1 degrees.” @CAPS1 the long @NUM2 mile trip with the slightes bit of water was hard. Enough with the heat, but then this was the rowling hills which made it even worse. That is how the setting came into play in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	11051	
8052	3	"The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed post Limit”, affect the cyclist emotionally and physically. In the beginning of his mislead journey the cyclist comes to ""one ramshackle shed, several water pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule. This sight troubled me.” This shows the cyclist was emotionally uneasy about the conditions of the area he was in and how much worse the conditions could possibly get. Also allowing the cyclist’s journey, “tumbleweeds accssed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamond back. It eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Because he was inches away from, possibles, a very dangerous snake, the cyclist felt mentally uneasy and tried to stay calm and keep his balance. Not only emotionally but also physically is how the features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist.         "	11052	
8053	3	"The featuers in the setting affect the cyclist in a sense of climate and turrain. First, the author says the terrain changed from flat road to short rolling hills. This affects the cyclist because his muscles get tired faster. Going up and down takes more energy than going on a flat,straight, road. Also, his journey take's him past an old Welch’s Grape juice factory. Unfortunately, he didn’t gain anything by going by there. He was very despirate for any kind of water, but had to be sure he wasn't hallucinating. Last, he fears he could ""drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" He describes his sweat on his shirt and the blistering heat from lack of water. The setting affects the cyclist in how he became tired, dehydrated and beated by the terrain of the land he was in.  "	11053	
8054	3	"Throughout the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist is often affected not only physically but mentally, as a result of the setting. At one point and time in the text, the sun started making the weather rather hot. At the same time though, the cyclist was in need of water and had to stop at a water pump. In the text it stated, “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” If the weather was cooler, the task of pumping water, might not have been as strenuous. Another physical effect of the cyclist beginning to sweat. In the story it mentioned, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” @CAPS1 to the heat the cyclist’s body reacted by producing sweat to cool down his body. A mental effect was when the cyclist saw a building resembling a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. Unsure that it even existed, because of his desolate location, he thought it was a mirage. In conclusion, the cyclist was affected by his setting."	11054	
8055	3	"The features of the setting definetly had an effect on the cyclist. For example, “The sun was begining beat down” this shows that it was starting to get extremely hot outside if when someones lost or low in water. it can stress them out. Also, the cycler was now comming across a sign that said “rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” It is already really hot out side, but now he has to work ever harder on his bike since the roads all bumpy. The cyclist was to beging to get extremly tired and dehydrated, but he sees a building down the hill & says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill”, which shows he had to work even harder to get down the hill, due to the fact that he was so tired. Many things from the setting had an effect on the cyclist."	11055	
8056	3	"In the essay the setting features affect the cyclest in many on different ways. One example he uses is a “ghoust town” which describes how spooky the town he arrived at must have been. Also “rame shaked sheds, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This qoute shows how old and ragged this fork of shorts that he had approached had looked like. This is two ways that the setting shows the ageless places he approached on his journey."	11056	
8057	3	The cyclist was riding in a very dry hot place. So while he was riding it was easier for him to get thirsty. I would suspect being a cyclist in a dry hot place by yourself would get pretty consirening when the cyclist runs out of water because your afraid your goig to die . That is why the seting affected the cyclist because it made it more challengening and scary.	11057	
8058	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills were strenuous. It says, “Over one long, crippling hill,” this shows that if the hills weren’t so long then it would be easier for him to ride. Especially if it was a flat road. It also says “Lodi, California,” which means it’s very hot, and if it wasn’t as hot then he wouldn’t need as much water and he wouldn’t get dehydrated as fast. It would be a lot easier to ride a bike on a flat steady road. Compared to the large highway sign that said “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	11058	
8059	3	"The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many way. It affect the cyclist because it is solo, were it take place and the amont the is. It was solo because it did not want a piece of advise, this is how the features of the settings affect the cyclist.   "	11059	
8060	3	"The features and setting affect the cyclist throughout the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting of a story is where the story is taking place. The cyclist had to go over large hills that took a lot of his energy. This is shown when he says “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view: The character used a lot of his energy to make it up the hill to get to the next town to get water. The weather was hot and this made the cycler get dehydrated faster. There was no water around for him to drink. The setting of this story affected the cyclist throughout the story"	11060	
8061	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the following ways: since it was extremely hot, he was in the desert, therefore it caused him problems when he ran out of water, and came across a pump that seemed as if it hadn’t been since @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and how it also tasted acidic. Another problem he dealt with, was poisonous snakes, since he was in the desert, so he had to be weary of them as well. Therefore this man had great troubles after listening to those old men."	11061	
8062	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead…” a cyclist takes advice from a bunch of “codgers” who in attempt to tell him of a shortcut, almost cause his downfall. As a result this cyclist is stuck in the high deserts of California, whose features greatly affect his trip. One feature of the setting is that it is desserted. After the first forty miles, the cyclist describes the first town he was supposed to hit as a ‘ghost town.” Then after another twenty miles he finds “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…” At this point the cyclist is low on water and tries the pumps. Because the towns have been empty for many years, the water in the pumps has “the flavor of battery acid.” Since no people were there to fix the water, the cyclist couldn’t get clean water, and began to suffer dehydration. Another feature of the setting is the heat. The cyclist had been “hitting his water bottles pretty regularly,” and the heat only added to his need for water. This need combined with the lack of water available caused the cyclist to begin dehydrating. This California setting affected the cyclist because it was a “desert” in two ways. Its surplus of heat combined with the lack of people helped to dehydrate the cyclist. For him, water was necessary, but unavailable.   "	11062	
8063	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in this deserted place with no one else there, no water and no since of direction, he says “There was no one in sight, not a building car or structure of any kind"". If he had more people in sight , a nearby building or a place to get some help he would have been fine."	11063	
8064	3	"The setting of the roads for the cyclist, affected his bike ride. setting is a term used for the time and place in a story. For the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” Was about when the autor took a bike ride to Yosemite and took advice from some of the codgers. When he took the short cut, there was roads in bad condition, a shack with rusty pipes, tumle weeds and snakes, and the weather that day was very hot. Since the day was very hot, the author ran out of water and got dehydrated. He also tried pumping the water out of the rusty pipes, which tasted like battery acid. Later, he finally found a bait shop with good water and he relaxed. the cyclist how knows to use the map, rather then listen to people who are out of date."	11064	
8065	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First off the hot weather beats down on the cyclist throughout his journey. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely notices it. Also, the cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June, therefore the temperature was extremely hot. For most of the ride, the cyclist was riding on flat road, meaning that he has to pedal more to maintain speed. “I notices the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “The hills meant that the rider could coast easily up and down these rolling hills. All these setting features affected the cyclist in that they all tired him out."	11065	
8066	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First after he notices his water “depicting”, he comes into “short, rolling hills.. tumbleweeds crossed my path and ridiculously large snake”. Because of the tumbleweed and snake, he had to ease past, and be careful not to lose his balance. Because he is dehydrated, it is hard to keep his balance. After that, he comes across a Welch’s grape juice factory, ironically enough. But the factory is abandoned, causing him to want water even more. He was so dehydrated that when he saw the building at first, he had to make sure he wasn’t dehydrating. Lastly, the fact that he was in the “high deserts of California in June” was a big deal. If he was biking in @LOCATION2, he wouldn’t have to worry about snakes and being dehydrated and getting a heatstroke. As you can see, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways."	11066	
8067	3	The cyclist had many challenges. Here are a few that were the roughest. The heat was the worst. The cyclist said in the Essay that it was about two hundred degrees and he had no water. He found a rusted pipe	11067	
8068	3	"There are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. The heat and barrenness of the places the cyclist is going affect him greatly. Also, the major lack of water affects him a lot. The major changes in the land the old people don’t know about probably affected him the most out of all of them. Another thing that affected the cyclist would be the snake he encountered, “a rediculous large snake. A really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The large snake really didn’t affect him out are but is still a conflict in the setting."	11068	
8069	3	The surroundings of cyclsit can affect him or her by if the sun is out and it is a nice cool breeze it can encouraging for a cyclsit to go out.	11069	
8070	3	"In the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” there are many things that affect the cycleist. His inability and mistake not to listen to the old folks made is trip to Yosemite National Park longer. While not taking a “shortcat” he went along way drinking a lot of his water supply, then arriving at a town “@NUM1 miles into the padal” he ran very low. Already thirsty he began again and came apon very low rolling hills which made it harder on his thirsty, dehiyhdrated body. After  passing  a long  venomas dimond-balk snake. Finally after trying pebbles in his mouth to stop the thirst and seeing the tease of a fresh glass of @CAPS1 grape juice he came apon “Gary and wilbers @CAPS2”. “I remember stumbling into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink”."	11070	
8071	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. It is hot outside, he has not much water. The speed limit is 55 mph, out he is going “a water-depleting @NUM1.” "	11071	
8072	3	In the story the features affect the the cyclist in many ways. The dead old town makes him  worry because there is no pottable water. Further  along He sees the juice factory and sees the boy drinking and he get  even more dehydrated. This is how I think the features affected the cyclist.	11072	
8073	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for the worse. The cyclist is going on a bike trip to Yosemite. He takes advice from some old men only to find that their route is horribly outdated. The cyclists main problem is that he was rolling on the towns on the short all for water, but none of these towns even exist anymore. This lack of water not only hurts the cyclist physically but he also loses all confidence. He is discouraged and doesn’t think he can make it alive. He thinks to himself. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Widening of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” the author is physically tired and the heat causes his thirst to grow. He would have had it easier if he was biking somewhere other then the desert. He can barely bike he’s so tired."	11073	
8074	3	"In the writing “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting  effect the cyclist in many ways. For example, if the terrain had been luscious and green with smooth trails it would have been a lot easier for the cyclist to conserve his energy. Also, because of the dry desert-like terrain and “blazing sun beating down hard” the cyclist gets very thirsty and dehydrated, causing his water supply to run out. If there had been shade the cyclist could have taken a break to build up his energy again. Finally, the author describes the town and factory he sees as it, “might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say before the last world war.” This shows that he was basically in the middle of nowhere. If there had been towns sporadically throughout his journey he could have rested, eaten, and obtained more water. This story is somewhat like when my family and I biked @NUM1 miles on the  @CAPS1& @CAPS2 canal on the hottest day of the year. "	11074	
8075	3	"I think it affects the cyclist positively because of the descriptions he have used, the enviroment sounds like a nice quiet relief of stress, pedeling while sunny outside letting the fresh air hit you from speeding on your bike. He described this experiences as a good one from descriptions like this one, ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and smile on my face.” It seems like  what he was planning on doing went better than he thought it would.   "	11075	
8077	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclis. because in the first paragraph he says ""Forget that old saying about never taking carely from strangers. No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be"" Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the countries of their perones since Carter was in office"". So now the cyclis is now lost and doesn't no were he is going and now on some rode, and goes dod knows were. In lodi, California. So that is what I think the features of the setting affect the cycles is talking about."	11077	
8078	3	"The different settings that the cyclist endures is one the old man that he meets that has never left his porch and gives him some out-dated information that is of no use to him. The old man tells him to save his water until he gets where hes going, but that is impossible because is hot outside and he could catch a heatstroke without any water. Then as he gets closer down the hill he spots a stick in the middle of the side walk and a snake that looks just like a diamond back. He thinks its poisonous so he takes caution before he atemps to ride past it just in case it strikes him."	11078	
8079	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclists for these reasons. First, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That alone with the temperatures @NUM1 degrees or more made it hard enough and then as the terrain changed from “Flat roads to rolling hills.” Rolling hills make it alot harder to peddle a bike. "	11079	
8080	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was motivated to get to “Yosemite”, but he had some difficulties on the journey. He did not gain much help on the way until the end when he found an older gentleman that knew exactly where he destined to be. The cyclist wasn’t to sure if the man really knew what direction to point him in. The road was not to had but the weather was hot and dry .The conditions of the weather and the lack of water that the cyclist had made it difficult. The cyclist was determined and confident. Those two qualities is what kept him going."	11080	
8081	3	"In the story there where many features of the setting affect.One was when he went into that one town or wherever there  where no buildings,people or anything.Also another one was when he asked those old people for directions."	11081	
8082	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist while he is riding because he didn’t listen. He didn’t take the advice of the old men because he thought they were wrong. But if had taken there advice he wouldn’t have had to sneak past a snake like it said he did in the text. This just goes to show you that you should take advice and listen to peoples warnings.	11082	
8083	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist by making his journey very difficult. The story takes place in California in June. This in itself means the temperature is extremely high. The author also describes that “at some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. This further sets the mood of a hot and dry environment. This also enforces the outdated nature of the old men’s directions. At another point in the story, the cyclist comes to a ranch that also appears old and outdated. The cyclist goes to the hand pump for fresh water and gets hot water that appears and tastes very unhealthy. In general, the setting of this story shows a mood of a hot, dry desert."	11083	
8084	3	"The features of the settings affect the cyclists in many ways. One is that it was very hot outside and he didn't have much water with him. Another one is that he was that there were no cars, buildings, or structures for him to go, to get help. He had to get past a snake that was blocking him while cycling. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist. "	11084	
8085	3	"The setting greatly affected the cyclist. The setting was in June, in @LOCATION1. The temperature was hot, and he was in the middle of the desert. In the essay the author states, “dried sweat circled my shirt drop from heatstroke.” This shows that the day was hot and he could die because of it. Once I was playing baseball outside in the middle of summer, and I forgot my water bottle. I felt really dizzy and sick to my stomach so I went and sat down in the shade."	11085	
8086	3	"The features of the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist. The first town that he comes to is an abandoned ghost town, Next, he comes upon a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and short rolling hills. All of those suggest the doubt in the cyclist to make it to his destination. When he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he tries not to get too excited, but got a burst of energy and made it down the hill towards it. When he realizes it was also abandoned, he wants to keep moving on towards civilization. When the cyclist finally makes it to @CAPS1 and Wilber’s fish camp, he felt a sense of relief and satisfaction that he had made it through his tough expedition."	11086	
8087	3	The features that affected the cyclist was the hot sun and burning desirt heat. I think this because he talked about sweating and how he was running out of water to cool him off.	11087	
8088	3	"In this story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, The setting effects the choiracter greatly. The first example is when he could not get water in the abandoned town. Since it was a Ghost Town, the water had the flavor of battery acid, because it was hot and he was biking, he needed water, and because of where he was, he couldn’t get it, also, the terrain made the bike harder. The story says ""I was doing a water pepleting 12 mph because the terrain had changed, slowing him down. @PERSON1, the cyclist is once again teased by the thought of water. Because of the low population, the welch’s grape juice factory was closed. So overall, the setting is what made the biker suffer the most."	11088	
8089	3	"The cyclist in the story goes through a lot of emotional ups and downs, many of which are featured by the setting. In the beginning when he is setting off, happy with his new men and he getting advice from the old men who remains to and time of he bike ride. When he arrives at the first “Town”, an abandoned ghost town, he is still happy, because he knows there will be another town up the end. After another @NUM1 minutes, hes reaches another small “town”,which has an old shed and he rests down that sprays hot, acids water. This is where he becomes get discouraged. After another bush @NUM2 miles, he sees an old abandoned Welch’s grape June fiction. The author now feels extremely thirsty as well as encouraged that the water never more it to Yosemite and could probably dry. As he feels proceed on, trying to forget about the past fallen towns he came upon area ground, where he got rested very happy again, read, for the rest of his time."	11089	
8090	3	"In this essay, the setting greatly affects the cyclist because as the towns become old and lonely, he becomes the don’t hopeless. In the essay, he describes one of the towns as a “ghost town.” he is saying how deserted and empty it is. This relates to him because he is also alone. The cyclist also talks about how he’s going to die and birds will pick at him. This shows that he is getting hopeless because he doesn’t think he will ever reach his destination. In the end, he finds anotheR older man who gives him anotheR map. With this map, he becomes more hopeful. He says that he will always stick to it in the future which shows hope. "	11090	
8091	3	"“ The Features oF the setting affect the cyclist Because There challges he has To meet. Pike when he came To realize maybe The old peoples way wasn’t The greatest when he saw.

8092	3	"In the story “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” the cyclist showed true determination throughout the story. When in a race everything around you takes into account. The weather conditions, road quality, heat/cold, and any other conditions could affect your turnout in the race. Depending on the weather it makes it a lot harder to pedal in the scorching heat with the son blazing on you, or even with the rain pouring on you, or even with the rain pouring on you. If the road isnt in good condition it makes it tough. With lots of stones, uneven pavement, and holes in the road. Theres a big difference pedeling all hills or just flat land. It takes alot out of you to go up and down the hills, ""With what I believe was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" This cyclists' story is very inspiring, and nothing got in his way. A true cyclist dosen't let the setting of his race get in his way."	11092	
8093	3	I will talk about how the setting affects the cyclist. The setting the cyclist by him having to chunk down water like the herbent had before. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	11093	
8094	3	"In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” settings controls all the characters feelings and attitudes. Despite the heat bearing down on the cyclist, he pushed. He is determined to finish his course. The man wouldn’t stop for water or a short rest. As his road began to get rough and he was losing water, he cycled @NUM1 in a @NUM2 speeding zone. Eventually he collapsed. "	11094	
8095	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is easier to go down a hill than it is to go up a hill. It takes more energy to go up a hill than to go down, this is how it affects the cyclist ride."	11095	
8096	3	"In the story do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist’s attitude is changed by the setting. In the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is happy and excited to get to his destination, Yosemite National Park. About @NUM1 miles into his journey the setting starts to change, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (@CAPS1). The change of the setting really alters the attitude of the cyclist because he starts to think he’s going to get lost. The more abandoned towns and tumbleweeds he sees, the more his attitude changes. The cyclist loses hope after every mile, when he finally sees a sign for a fishing shop he is happy again, “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy some bait” (@CAPS2). The cyclist is happy when he is in a civil area. The cyclists mood and attitude have a lot to do with the setting."	11096	
8097	3	"The features of the setting in this reading affect thcyclist in many ways. For example the talk about all the hills and roads and how desserted it is which makes it seem even more hard then it really was. Also in the reading they say. “ There was no one in sight not a buliding, car, or structure of any kind.” Them saying that makes me be able to imagine the story in my head and it’s so much better  to understand it when l can do that."	11097	
8098	3	"In the morning the cyclist’s mood was good because he was ea, his own semient. He was confident, eager, and full of energy, prepared for a good journey. As his day progressed the area was dry and empty and rough. He began do lose his energy and the belief that he could do this. Near the end he was tiched off because he had listened to the old men and he didn’t have any water as the area was rougher and laugher at the end @CAPS1 the bathroom, he thought “haleugha!"" @CAPS1 this setting made him feel amazed and the water would give him new energy to go on."	11098	
8099	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is because it looks to be no endin she he feels he has been beat by nature and that not the best and most determination could get him to his destination.	11099	
8100	3	"In Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclist ran into a few problems on the way to a “shortcut.” It really wasn’t a “shortcut”, older guys gave him directions which those men hadn’t been off of their properity in a very long time. The cyclist feels sorry for himself. For listening to olderly men. Some of the problems that the cyclist had ran in to were; he ran out of water and in this town the water that he needed very despareitely. The cyclist also ran in to a really large snake and that would have been very dangerous because he is out in @LOCATION1 desserts. Those were some of the problems that the cyclist had ran in to. After the cyclist seeing a sign called, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” he really need water and directions. So he went in their asked the guy for water and a very good map. After that the cyclist was on his way."	11100	
8101	3	The setting of the cyclist trip affected his attitude and his physical capability to easily complete his journey. The cyclist at the begining of his trip was ready for the day but as he came into the deserted old town with no people he lost spirit. Even though he was disapointed he kept on going. As he made his way his water ran low and it was hot with no trees to give him shade. The cyclist began to get tired and dehydrated. As he made his way through the desert a snake crossed his path he was affected by this animal because he wouldn’t be quick enough to get away from it. The cyclist managed to get away but yet again faced with a challenge a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead ”(@NUM1) the cyclist would have to be very cautious even though he is tired.	11101	
8102	3	"During the cyclist’s long day, the features of the setting which he is placed in affect his moods. His moods change on factors of energy and water supply. Overall, his mood seems to start out great. The cyclist starts out confident because of the shortcut which would cut miles off of his long ride. He, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile” ready for the long day. His mood then became desperate as his water levels dropped. He coments that his water bottles, “contained only a few tantilizing sips,” and adds that trouble to his position in the desert. He soon finds relief coming to a bait shop and getting a drink. He was on his last hopes but prevailed. I would also be relieved to find water. The setting changes the riders moods by trying his faith in himself."	11102	
8103	3	"The seting of the California desert, has a huge affect on the cyclist because it shows the consequences he suffers from taking an elders advice. In the story, the author takes a short cut given to him by an old man. Later the author finds himself struggling for his life. The hot weather and rough roads make traveling nearly impossible for the author. If the story had taken place in a city, the author could simply ask for directions of someone. Also, road conditions wouldn’t have been nearly as bad as they were in the desert. The setting of a desert with rough roads best goes along with the message of don’t follow elders advice that is how the setting affects the cyclist, and why it is important."	11103	
8104	3	"In the text, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit”  the features of the setting affect the cyclist very strogly. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water – depleting 12 mph. sometimes life can feel so cruel” In the text the cyclist truly questions the “old-timers” advice. This bumpy and difficult road begin to tear apart the cyclist not only physically but emotionally as well. With low water supplys and the beating summer heat, he is afraid he won’t make it. “At some point tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridicoulsly large snake – it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” the snake represents his trouble and difficulties. Despite the dongers and size of the snake the cyclist carefully manages to get around it and continue on the difficult journey, no matter what @MONTH1 challenge him."	11104	
8105	3	"The setting of this essay is in a dasert, not much water; and not many people. Those were the settings that mostly effected the cyclist."	11105	
8106	3	"Well, the cyclist went riding and the road was really smooth and nice and then he gets down the road and saw that the road became rugged and hard to ride on so the conditions affected him in the way that he could not enjoy his ride to where he needed to go."	11106	
8107	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example when the cyclist is first starting on his way he says “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he is feeling confident and is doing well. Next halfway into his trip he says “I would conserve my water and go in ward for an hour or so-a test of my inner spirit.” This shows that he is starting to feel like he isn’t going to make it. Finally he says “And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.” This means that he will never take directions from seniors again These features of the.	11107	
8108	3	"The setting plays a big part in the cyclist’s story. In fact if it weren’t for the setting (no where to get water and intense heat) the story wouldn’t even exist. For example, the whole story is about trying to get a park, but running out of water. Also, the author stresses the hot and fact that he was in a desert many times. After reading this story, it is appearant the setting has a huge role in it."	11108	
8109	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. This is because all the terrain expressed had an impact on what the cyclist was feeling and thinking. For example, when the author wrote “this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on that morning, it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.”  The author was confident even though this town was deserted a minor set back. He had no idea the trouble he was in for. Once he noticed the terrain changing from “Flat road was replaced by short, caving hills.” The cyclist was beginning to have trouble, especially when the sign posted had said “Rough Road Ahead.” This how the terrain in the essay helped to show the different affects the cyclist was going through."	11109	
8110	3	"In this essay, the features of the setting really affect the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph it says, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time. Say, befor the last world war- but on that morning it fit traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was the start of his journey and already the directions were wrong. This was the start of the downfall of his journey. Another example is, “…the building-abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it- had been a @ORGANIZATION1 and bottling plant.” This made his thirst quench even more. All he needed was a refreshing drink, seeing the picture of a “young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” did not help at all. But finally, he reached a sign for a bait shop where he could get water, this gave him a lot of hope.  "	11110	
8111	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” the features of the setting greatly affects the cyclist. When he first stars off everything is fine and he gets directions from a few old men. This later affects him when he realizes that their information is out of date and he is going through ghost towns with nothing in site. The ghost towns are another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist. He is dehydrated and there is nowhere to get water which ends up making him lose hope and think he’s going to die. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the rough roads he has to pedal on. Not only is he dehydrated but he has to use whatever bit of energy he @MONTH1 have to pedal on those roads. These are some of the main feature of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist in the story."	11111	
8112	3	"The features of the setting affecting the cyclist because he was traveling through the high deserts of California trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The sun was beginning to beat down an him and he had little water supply. Later on in his journey, he tumbled across thought he was going to drop from a heatstroke."	11112	
8113	3	"There are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One feature is the, “Ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn't hoped in they lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling.” There was little sigh of life or anything nearby. When the author tried to get water out of the pump, he was left with a few drops of foul tasting water. He became worried and desperate. The terrain also affected the cyclist. The road began getting bumpy with tumbleweeds and it was hard for the cyclist to keep his balance while he was dehydrated. He was feeling desperate for water. The rusted pump and bumpy roads made him fell defeated his feelings changed when he saw the sigh for the fish camp. He was overwhelmed with excitement and thankful. I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and willBur, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The features of the setting affected the authors feeling. Recently I had a similar experience. I was in @LOCATION1 with my family site seeing and got lost. Unlike the cyclist, we discovered we were near @LOCATION2 and the beautiful setting exited us. We ended up visiting @LOCATION2 and enjoying ourselves. "	11113	
8114	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly on his journey. For instance , California is a very hot place. What makes it hotter is being in California's desserts in June. These setting elements affected the cyclist, because it made it harder for them to keep going because they repeatedly needed water. The setting in this story greatly impacted the cyclist’s ability to successfully get to rosemite."	11114	
8115	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist. He was affected by heet because he was riding through the desert in June. He ran out of water along the way. Also he had to go overe hills.	11115	
8116	3	Setting affects cyclist because to maxamize riding comfort things have to be ideal for the rider. Temporature is a feature of the setting that would affect a cyclist. The temperature shouldn’t be too hot because you would get dehydrated too easily. If the temperature is too cold their joints might stiffen up making it hard to ride. The time of day would also affect the rider because if it is early morning or midafternoon the sun might be in your eyes. If it is late afternoon or night It would also be hard to see because of no sun. The amount of people would be a factor. If something went wrong like if they crashed and got hurt people would be able to help but if there are none then the accident could be fatal. There are many featurs of the setting that can affect a cyclist.	11116	
8117	3	"The features of the setting effected the rider in many different ways. For example in the essay he quotes “@NUM1 miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. On ramshackie shed, several rusty pumps. I had been my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high desserts in California.” The rider face hard ships on the road, and has to salvage watever water he might have left, and the terrain also affects the rider of the bike. Also “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sain jumped out at me. It read; ROUGH ROAD AHEAD; DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” @CAPS1 entails that the rider had very rough terrian and was affected by the conditions of the road. And was affected by it."	11117	
8118	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. One is that its hot and haves nothing around for miles. This affects him because it very lonly and very dangerous. He could pass out and die of heat or freeze to death at night. So the cyclist is affected by the features in the story.	11118	
8119	3	"Hot, thrsty, sunny- all are describitions of the setting of the story. The story"	11119	
8120	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist cause it was less two hundred degrees."" And you can did if you did have a lot water."	11120	
8121	3	"The settings of the cyclist was somewhere in the deserts because it was near a lot of sand and no trees. You can also look at the photo and know its in a warm location because it has dryed up trees, brancnes instead of grass its sand."	11121	
8122	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because people who are cyclist ask for information and the might get a right directions as a wrong one or maybe they just didn’t understand what was being said. Because maybe they didn’t know what they were saying. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of those reasons	11122	
8123	3	"In my opinion I think the features of setting affect the cyclist is limited , you have know what you are doing, it is not like a grambling ground, and that affected the cyclist"	11123	
8124	3	The features of the setting affected the cylisicstt by making it diffulcet for him for example the @CAPS1 made it hot to him. also the Hills made it difficult  for him because he had to work a lot harder to climb a hill and also he has running out of water. This makes it tough on him because he get dehydrated fast.	11124	
8125	3	"The many features of the setting affect the cyclist in a variety of ways. At the first stop, the “ghost town didn’t concern him too much as the narrator says, “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.” At the second stop, it is evident that the, man is concerned that he has come across another ghost town, because he says, “This sight was troubling.” The cyclist probably feels very disappointed and a bit angry when he pumps out a “tar like substance” from the rusty water pump, “followed by brackish water feeling two hundred degrees.” The unexpected, pungent battery acid flavor of the water most likely made him want to puke. As he rides through rough, rolling hills, he becomes very depressed when he realizes from a road sign that he could be going 55 mph in a car, instead of the measly 12 mph, he was traveling. When he saw tumbleweeds cross his path, he probably felt totally lost and when he spotted a huge snake, he probably felt scared that he might fall and get bitten easily, being so dehydrated. After he comes across the old grape juice factory, he feels tortured and and mad, and then is desperate enough to suck on a pebble in attempt to keep his saliva circulating. When he finally reaches the fish camp, he is overjoyed and ecstatic, and drinks “deeply from the sink. “He is finally rehydrated and relieved that he has found civilization, and, more importantly, water."	11125	
8126	3	"The features or the setting affect the cyclist so much. Hes probably feeling every negative emotion there is. I mean, first off, he has no water in the middle of a desert in June, I would be affected too. He’s obviously feeling hoplesness. And he’s probably also very sleepy. He’s been biking for hours in the sun with no water or gorunteed destination. “ The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depreting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel. “This quote not only expreses his anger but also his self pity. The cyclist was affected in more ways than one over the setting. "	11126	
8127	3	"During the cyclist’s trip the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First off when he goes through the towns he is told to go through on his short cut they are all abandoned. Secondly he is going through the highest dessert in California in June which means it is pretty hot out and that he could become dehydrated easier or quicker. Also there are no cars, buildings or people in sight as he keeps on riding and riding. As he says “There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind.”(Kurmaskie). Also he encounters a snake on the way which must have been scary. Finally he gets to a fish and bait store and is able to get to the bathroom and drink some water to rehydrate him. This is how the features in the setting affected the cyclist. "	11127	
8128	3	"The settings affect the cyclist in many ways. He is going to Yosemite but on the way he asked some old timers for some directions. Not keeping in mind that he was told “Never to accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left their porches for decades,” he took the advice and they led him to abandoned places that were open back in their. Since they been on their porch for ever they never new about the changes in the roads ahead. Now the second old timer he come across he knows not to take directions from. He is in danger of his life; dehydration and pecked to death or even bitten by a poisonous snake.   "	11128	
8129	3	"At first, the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was not troubled by the inconveniences, but later in the story, he was becoming discouraged.The story states, “...but on that morning, it fit the defintion of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1) This shows that he was in good spirits because he laughed, but almost still concerned because he checked his water supply. Later the story quotes, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM2) This shows that the cyclist has changed his mood to unhappy and desperate because he is running out of water and he can only go so fast on the road."	11129	
8130	3	"Some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. The California desert affected the cyclist because of the lack of water, which was his his biggest problem. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The @ORGANIZATION1 factory is also a very big factor because it reminds him of his thirst, the text states. “In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building-abandoned years- earlier, by the looks of it had been a @ORGANIZATION1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.”"	11130	
8131	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting effect, the cyclist. First, he was going a great distance. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”. If only the first town was @NUM1 miles, then the trip would be a long while. Also, he had a limited water supply and very hot weather.” …checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down. “This is a major effect, because if he ran out of water, the sun would cook him. Finally, their was the change of roads to hills “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This would cause him to put forth more effort to peddle, and make him waste energy."	11131	
8132	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the use of imagery helped the readers to understand the cyclists difficulties. Joe Kurmaskie used descriptive words to make the essay very realistic. For example, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hill”(Kurmaskie).Shows how the author used certain words to let the reader actually imagine what it was like for the cyclist. The cyclists main problem was his lack of water. Having no water on a hot summer day in California would be termendiously hard to ride a bike for several hours. Also in the essays it said the roads were very up and down and not flat anymore. “Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside @NUM1). This quote shows that after all that struggle for water, he finally finds water a persevers through the tough time he had."	11132	
8133	3	In the essay the person at first and the road is alright and ok. For example he said this would be a easy ride. I the next setting which is the rough it road and hard passes he starts to become boutful and igronat.	11133	
8134	3	"No water, 55 mph, rolling hills- all are features of the setting. First, no water because he ran out and the only water he could find tested like acid and was really hot. Second, @NUM1 because he was about to reach a highway and the old men said there was no highway. Next, rolling hills because he was exhausted and had no water and didn’t think he could make it up the rolling hills. Lastly, these all are features of the setting."	11134	
8135	3	"Safe, dangerous, difficult- all are things that can describe the cyclist setting. First, it is a safe place he is at, a cool place. His legs are rested, water is full and is confident. He  fells safe with his setting and fells that everything is going to be ok. Also his water is completly full and he is very well hydrated. Then the setting turns into a dangerous one because the direction he was given are not accurate and could get him killed. Then he starts to run out of water and get dehydrated. Lastly it becomes a difficult terrain setting, where  he has to ride over hills and difficult terrain. All while he is tired, unsure, and running out of water. The setting of the cyclist changes through out the story and changes from good to bad."	11135	
8136	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the narrator goes through trouble on his way to Yosemite on a bike. On his way he asks directions from two old men who say that it is @NUM1 miles down the road with limited water the narrator says he can make it. On his way down the road the actual pavement stops and the rest of the road is made of dirt and rock wich is a hard way to go on a bike. The narrator has to cross post a snake and when the narrator finally sees a building he finds that it is an abandoned grape juice building. The write time he takes how he will die of dehydration and how the birds will pick him clean. Towards the end the narrator finds a store that sells bait and he goes and drinks from the sink. He finally talks to the store manager when looks older then the last person he talked to asks for direction and this time the shop manager gives the narrator a map.	11136	
8137	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The speed limit was too much for them. They state, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. This was causing him to dehydrate."	11137	
8138	3	"There were many things about the seting that affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie. The two I think are very important are that it is a desert and that the places he goes are all desserted, The dessert affects the cyclist because if it were in a forrest that was cool he wouldn’t have to “conserve my water” @CAPS1 was a big part of the story. Also desertednes of the places he went affected him also because none of the places had any one there that could help or care about him. These were the things that affected him the most how about        . "	11138	
8139	3	"Sun, heat, desert- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First the sun was hot so there was no shade for the cyclist said the heat of the day was extreme the narrator exclaims “I was traveling through the high desert of California in June.” That would have had a major efect on the cyclist because he would have ben dehydrated very fast. Lastly he was in the desert with, so he could not just stop and ask for some water to drink. This would also cause some cycological problems or even an amsicty attack. All these play a crushal roll in how the cyclist is afected physicly and mentaly on his rid throgh the deserts of California. All these combined would have made the cyclist exhausted.  "	11139	
8140	3	"The cyclist after asking for a shorter route to Yosemite National Park, recieves some out of date information. While dealing with the stupidity of taking advice from, ""gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh,"" for he says this after he realizes what trouble he is in. He rides forty miles, only to find a ""ghost town"" Then he rides on and starts to run out of water; he suffers from dehydration and almost has a heat strke. While going up in down rolling hills, stopping at abandoned towns, he can't find any water. The only water tastes like Battery acid. When he thinks finally thinks he has found water, he comes across an abandoned Welch's can say a slap in the fare to taking advice from out dated people. He, however, when he comes across a Fish camp, he doesn't ask for directions from an even older guys. He knows how to just take the long way and trust himself. Unfortunately, he had to learn the hard way.   "	11140	
8141	3	"The features of the setting of “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The rolling hills make it so he has to bike up alot of hills making it harder then biking on flat land. The desert, which he is biking through, makes the lack of water even worse because of the heat. Also, finally for a cyclist rough road can be very hard to conclude  on a bike. As you can clearly see the cyclist has to overcome the features in the setting."	11141	
8142	3	"Throughout the story the cyclist is faced with some extreemly hard conditions. The hardest featue of the setting where he is cycling through is probabelly the heat he is experiencing. The cyclist is trying to get a taste of his water when he tasted it it seemed really hot. ""Water feeling somewhere in the neighbourhood of two hundred degrees,” To get watre that hot it must be extremeely hot outside. Therefore the cyclist had to have been dealing with exteme temperatures"	11142	
8143	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted speed Limit”, the cyclist encounters different terrains and environments along his journey to Yosemite National Park. Cycling is always easier on flat or level ground and when riding down a hill. In the beginning, the cyclist was travelling on flat ground, but he, “noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (kurmaskie  @NUM1). Sure he was going down, but that also meant that he had to cycle up too. along the way, the cyclist encounters a diamondback snake which “blocked the majority of the pavement in front of” (Kurmaskie page @NUM2) him. Tumbleweed and the hot summer sun in California added to the cyclist’s struggles to get to Yosemite. Overall, the different terrains and environments of California affected the cyclist who was traveling to Yosemite. "	11143	
8144	3	"The features of the setting the cyclist is in affect him greatly. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie. He is biking through an extremely hot @CAPS1 desert that is causing him to feel dehydrated and weak. Seeing nothing but flat land terrain when he knows he is all but fresh out of water is very frightening and discouraging. He knows he might not make it much longer if he doesn’t find water soon. Just from seeing barren land and the intimidating setting just adds to the pressure he is under to make it. “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine "" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Henceforth, just being in that setting he happened to be in the cyclist was even more pressured. His setting almost killed him, but it gave him a stronger will to live."	11144	
8145	3	"The features of the setting made a big impact on Joe Kurmaskie. After reading, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” By Joe Kurmaskie, one can see that differnnt feeatures of a setting can make a huge impact on the outcome. First Joe arricved at a fork of sorts, ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and a corral. This sight wasn’t very pleasant, infact it troubled him. Also, when Joe got through the high deserts and stopped for water, the water was two hundred degrees and had the favor of battery acid. Some other features were the rough roads which made Joe slow down. He came through tumbleweeds and a large snake. Being in abandaned town with none in sight would feel worse and felt as if he was going to die. In conclusion, the freatures of the road or settings can make a big impact on the cyclist."	11145	
8146	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. To began with, the story took place in a desert-like area in California. It was extremely hot and dry there to begin with. The cyclist had a long trip ahead of him, but he hadn’t realized how harsh it was going to be. The cyclist asked two old men how to get to his destination, but their information was outdated. The cyclist didn’t realize this until after he started his trip, which ended up hurting him in the long run. The cyclist had to ride his bike over “short, rolling hills” and rough roads. This already would take more energy than what he thought because he believed he would be riding o n flat roads the whole time. Because of this setting, the cyclist soon ran out of water that tasted like battery add the cyclist would’ve been a lot better off if he had gotten updated directions and planned his trip better."	11146	
8147	3	"The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.” Speed limit was 55 mph. I was going a water depleting 12 mph.” he was tired and thirsty.His surrandings weren’t helping him find water.It was not and sticky so it was hard for him to move with no water.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” He had seen a building, which he hoped had water or something to drink there, I wanted to make sure he wasn’t dreaming it and it really was there.” I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth.” These pebbles were helping him formulate water. He heard by sucking on pebbles he could get some sort of water or spit so, he was trying to do anything to get water. The features affected him in my ways some helped him others were just there, but they did affect him."	11147	
8148	3	"Planning on visiting the beautiful town Yosemite, one unlucky cyclist was in for a big surprise. He was given out of date directions by two eccentric old men from his campsite. “… I was travelling  through the high desserts of California in June”, said the cyclist. During his eventful…journey, the cyclist was haunted my many features of the setting. First, he had to face rough terrain and rocky hills. He had seen a sign that read “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit.” The cyclist pushed on, at a speed way less than the posted speed. the rough terrain extremely slowed him down. The cyclist also suffered from lack of water. The next feature really hurt him. The text sa us, “the building...had been welches Grape Juice factory ….. A sand blasted picture of a young bell pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” The setting made the cyclist’s journey a living nightmare, an “ironic twist” to what he had been expecting."	11148	
8149	3	"Many features of the setting must have made it harder for the cyclist to keep going.One is the “crippling hill”.Cyclist loikes have skinny tires made for roads not crippling hills so that must have been hard to ride down.“Short,rolling hills.”Because he didn’t have any water it had to have been hard for him to ride up a hill.Therefore a lot of features of the setting made it that much harder for the cyclist."	11149	
8150	3	The way that the feature of the setting affected the cyclist be was the land. The river was a big part. The other part was the speed limit that was put on the road. Aother thing was the way that the land was formal with the hills. The reeson it was the speed limit was because it was only 55 mph and the sign told not to go any faster. Also the road conditions where very bad.	11150	
8151	3	"The features in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in his penary Yosemite National Park with a limited water supply, the cyclist had to drink his.  "	11151	
8152	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” the setting affects the cyclists feelings. First the bumpy and rocky roads make the cyclist feel less confident in his ability to make it to a town with water. Also the hot temperatures affect him by making him want water. Finally at the end of the story he says “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.”  After hearing this I feel that the bends affect the cyclist positively because it allows him to rest and gain energy."	11152	
8153	3	"The setting in Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” creates the main problem for the cyclist. The main character claims, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The main character is battling thrist and heat through the high temperatures of the desert. If he keeps finding the abandoned towns he will most likely died from the heat. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist is completely alone. He can’t find a town or anyone to give him water. Without anything but the desert sand and heat, he will die. The conflict is finally sloved as the main character gets out of the desert and finds a town with water."	11153	
8154	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist very badly. He is in the smoking hot desert running out of water, thinking that he is goining to die. The cyclist has no water trying to find the next town where is a long way away. The cyclist then gets a break and goes on his way. Then the cyclist reaches his destination."	11154	
8155	3	"One of the features of the setting that affect the cyclsit is the heat. Since it's usually very hot in deserts, you tend to drink a lot of water. Doing so caused the cyclist to quickly become low on water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist is the dryness. Not only is it hot but the lead's a dry heat that also depleted your water supply faster. A third feature is the rolling hills. It takes alot of energy to ride up a hill. However it's one harder when your running low on water. You are, however, offer some help going up the other hills by dicking up speed going down the hills before it. These features of the setting and more affected the cyclist in the story."	11155	
8156	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist by him being in the desert without barely any water. “To keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS1 he was in need of water to keep himself alive. He faced snakes, buzzards and it had been deserted.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” @CAPS1 that he was alone which wasn’t a very good thing in the desert. If your alone in the desert you could get killed or eaten by animals. This is why the desert affected the setting of the story for the cyclist."	11156	
8157	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated and tired. Because he was in a desert, there was & no one around. Also, there was no water. These inturn caused him to become dehydrated there was also no trees. This mnt there was no shade. This also caused his dehydration. That way why he was tired during the trip."	11157	
8158	3	"Setting is everything to the cyclist. It determines what the road will be like, the weather, and all the enviromental factors that could help or hinder their experience. If you are in an area that is very hot and dry, chances are that you will run out of water more quickly and became dehydrated. This will make cycling physically brutal and can even lead to serious health problems. The enviroment that the cyclist is in is also very important because things like trees and the animals around can make the path much less navigatable. @PERSON1, the  author of, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" had to deal with setting a lot during his cycling journey. His first problem was the sun beating down and him becoming very thirsty. At one point he actually thinks that he is going to die. The setting that he found himself in was quite challenging because there really wasn’t anywhere that he could go for resources. The second problem he had to face was the rough rocky terrain which impeaded his navigation greatly, the environmental factor or animals. He had to work his way around agiant snake!  "	11158	
8159	3	At first he was lost but then he found the town. No thanks to the old men.	11159	
8160	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist has a very hard time being lost in California, thanks to two old men. First, the town he goes to is abandoned. Then he runs out of water. Later, his path is blocked by a snake. Then his trail gets rougher. These conditions made the cyclist want to give up completely. But eventually he finds a bait shop and survives."	11160	
8161	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe kurmaskie the elements of the desert affects the rider greatly. The rider is dehydrated and has a lack of water in his water bottles “The water bottles containing only afew tantalizing sips,"" also the sun beating down on him made him sweat more cousing him drink more. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regualary”, and the rider didn’t  a good time to take bike ride.”I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June”. That is how the element in the essay affect the rides."	11161	
8162	3	"In the story of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rusted waterpump."	11162	
8163	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the feature of water affected the cyclist alot. It did this by making the cyclist believe we die. Another example would be the heat in the story the cyclist said, ""I could drop from a heatstroke. ""@CAPS1 the sign of of the fishing came was a feature of the setting that affected the cyclist."	11163	
8164	3	The setting is in a desert. And the cyclist is out of water and every place he goes the either don’t have water or its nasty or its very hot.	11164	
8165	3	"There seemed to be a few problems for the cyclist and the setting. One problem is he was riding in the open sun in California, in the middle of June. This is a problem because sometimes the weather gets so hot that people die of heatstroke. Another problem that the cyclist encounter is the terrain. In the story he says it goes from flat, desert terrain to rolling hills. It’s obviously much eaiser to ride a bike over flat terrain than up hills, so these conditions affected the cyclist. Another problem for the cyclist and the setting would be the fact that all of the towns that the cyclist kept arriving at ghost towns. This was a problem because the cyclist had very little water left after a while. These problems, chart among them lack of water must have been devastating for the cyclist because he writes about how bad his “shortcut” was."	11165	
8166	3	Some things that could affect the setting would be the rolling hills that seem to go forever or the barren west land of the desert or in cones in the abandon villages and building but one thing the author seems to creep with him would be his confidence in his cycling and his perseverance. The hot weather and lack of water and have had something to do with the setting and his mood also.	11166	
8167	3	"The most challenging problem faced by the author during his journey would be the lack of water. In the text it states, “the growing realization that I could drop from the heat” (Kurmaskie @NUM1) .This shows that the lack of water @MONTH1 kill him from dehydration or heat stroke. The lack of water in this mans adventure would be his most challenging problem."	11167	
8168	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is affected by the setting enormously. When the cyclist first starts out after listening to these two old men’s advice and taking “the shortcut.” He becomes very disheartened. When he comes to the first town he calls it a “Ghost town.” With this he just chuckles and plays it off not thinking about how hot it is becomeing after riding @NUM1 more miles up a road he saw “rusty pumps.” This sight  troubled him. He pumped for water after now feeling very dehydrated drinking water was left in his water bottle all he got from the pump was warm “battery acid” tasting water. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, “growing realization I could drop from heatstroke” caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh.” So the cyclist after coming to a “Fish camp” stumbled into the bathroom relieved to dunk his head in the sink. Through this ordeal it is evident to see that the harsh setting the cyclist went through affected him deeply.  "	11168	
8169	3	It seem to me you should pack plenty of water to make a trip like that I would pace myself cause I was on a trip like that in Boy @CAPS1 Camp and rash out of water hard time that was.	11169	
8170	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways during his ride. When he start off he comes to a ghost town and assumed that it was just a mistake by his old guides. Then, as he came to a park in the road, he began to worry a little. He was running out of water and it was pretty hot. After riding some more, he came to a Welch’s Grape juice factory that had been abandoned. He felt a bit defeated because he had little water left and Yosemite was still nowhere in sight. Before continuing, he attempted to suck on a few pebbles to get spit flowing. By now, he was in a complete state of dispair, having thoughts of dying, with his destination still nowhere in sight. He soon came to Gary and @PERSON1’s fish camp, and felt joyous because he’d finally found a populated place. However, he now decided to never take advice from the elderly again at least on biking trips. This confirmed when he is having a conversation with another old man who asked if the cyclist knew how to get to Yosemite. The cyclist responded with: ""yes sir! I own very good maps.”"	11170	
8171	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is running out of water. The cyclist is riding in a deserts in California in June, when it is maybe the hottest time of year. The problem that the cyclist is that the lack of water and how hot it is he @MONTH1 pass out or be so thirsty he @MONTH1 loose train of thought. Also All the hills and different road types @MONTH1 affect the cyclist too. That is how the features of the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist."	11171	
8172	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting definitly affects the cyclist in many ways. For one thing, he runs out of water, and can’t find another source. In turn, he becomes dreadfully dehydrated. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the desert atmosphere causes him problems. He meets poisonous snakes saying “It really did look like a diamond back” (@NUM1). This snake could kill him. The heat moved with dehydration is also life threatening. “Wide ring of sweat circled my shirt . drop from heatstroke . “(@NUM1). The hilly terrain also caused problems. The cyclist was riding a bike and hills are hard anyway but in the blistering heat it was un bearable! Its quite obvious how determine the cyclist had to be. He fought rugged terrain, heat, poisonous snakes, and lack of water, all of which had the power to kill him."	11172	
8173	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by slowing him down. The setting can also hurt the cyclist. If the cyclist is running out of water he will have to find a pump or foucol to till upon water. If the cyclist gets bitten by any animal or attaked by an animal he will need medical help.	11173	
8174	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a life – changing way. The narrator says, “@CAPS1 long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), and “.I believed was my last burst of energy.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The setting keeps putting him down, but he keeps pushing on through. He learns a life lesson: perserverance."	11174	
8175	3	"The cyclist becomes tired and thirsty. With nowhere else to go he is forced to keep pedaling through this desert in california. I’m guessing he’s in a hurry. Since he cant wait to get to Yosemite National Park.” The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” This probably is the reason he finishes he’s water so quickly. He isn't being too smart and his mind is elsewhere. He isn't thinking that conserving his water @MONTH1 be the right thing to do. Also, the narrator is struck riding in @DATE1. It gets really hot in this time. He is also using a lot of his e nergy by going up hills. Going down them takes not a lot of energy but a bumpy tarrain can take a lot of him."	11175	
8176	3	"In ‘Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. To start his ride, the cyclist was on a typical road that wasn’t too hilly. Because of this he says, “The sun was beginning to beat, but I barely noticed it” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), later on, when he comes to the rough roads and big hills, he becomes tired, weak, and exhausted very easily. It is clear that the cyclist is greatly affect by the setting."	11176	
8177	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative manner. Because the cyclist was dehydrated, the desert scene wasn’t helping to ignore his thirst, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamond back – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the desert scene probably made him very delusional. This shows when the narrator states, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Overall, the dry, California desert setting affected the cyclist negatively, because of its dry, hot heat."	11177	
8178	3	"When I see this cyclist I think of speed, flowing lines, and endurance. In this picture I see a hill with a curvy road that suggest to me that he/she is going fast I get endurance out of this picture cause working out /cycling you reed endurance. This picture gives me a lot of reminder of my life and the will to keep going."	11178	
8179	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, features of the setting make the cyclist weak and doubtful. The cyclist is dehydrated. He says “Rings of dried sweat circled my shirt I could drop from heat stroke.” This shows that the main character is very weak, later in the story the cyclist gets a negative attitude and says “I was going to die and the birds would pick me down.” This shows that he is very doubtful, and regrets accepting directions from the old men. In conclusion, the features of the setting are making the man extremely weak and doubtful. "	11179	
8180	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was riding a big. When the features started changing to hills riding the back was getting harder and harder. He was also affected because of the lack of water but he was so determined to get to where he was going. Like for an example the speed limit changed to @NUM1 and he was driving @NUM2. He was affected by that because he was riding a bike and that was kind of scary for him to go that fast down a hill. Everytime the features would change he would get threw it to reach his destination. Finally at the end the feature helped him find the way to the store with juice and he dranked plenty of water. That’s how the setting affect the cyclist.  	11180	
8181	3	"In the story “do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting afects the author by making the journey harder for him. The author was trauling threw @LOCATION1 to get to @CAPS1 national Park. He had taken the advise of several old men, and was taking a “short cut “ that would slice miles off his journey. He encounterd ghost towns, hills, and a snake that looked alarmingly like a diamond back rattler, but his worst enimy was lack of water. “I was traveling threw the highg deserts of @LOCATION1 in June,” says the author, “…the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps.” @CAPS2, the author is out of water. Sins the towns the old men had told him about no longer existed, the author was in a baren desert, with lmited water, and was encountering dangerous snakes. So the setting makes the authors joun a lot harder."	11181	
8182	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a couple was. First the road conditions affected him. For example in the story it “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit on the speed lim was @NUM1 an he was only doing @NUM2. Another way it affected this cyclist is he would go down hill and not have to pedal. Last there was no water so he was thirsty and in the story it said he stuck a rock in his mouth to take his mind off of thirst. thats how the setting affects the cyclist.	11182	
8184	3	"Features of the setting, such as water supply, snakes and terrain have an affect on the cyclist. For example, the terrain changes when the cyclist says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie). This caused him to slow down, which made the trip even more agonizing. Also, the snake that he sees affects the cyclist on his journey. This happens when, “a rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This, much like the changing terrain, slowed the cyclist on his journey, increasing his discomfort. Finally, the lack of water had a big affect on the cyclist. This is seen in the text after the snake has blocked the road. He tries to maneuver around the snake, “in my dehydrated state."" The cyclist is missing an essential for a human to survive, which takes a toll on his performance and ability to cycle. The setting really makes the cyclist’s journey seem longer."	11184	
8185	3	"The features of the setting which were desert likes roads, and abandones town affected the cycler in this short story. The setting scared to be very hopeless, like the cycler didn’t have to good chance to make it trough all at like hardship. ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” That means tht the cyclest must have had a very hard time California has a lot of very big hills, and it’s very hott as well. In fact, the cyclest sees a tumblereed, which is usually associated with desert or anything that has been deserted. It is very depressing and hard for a cyclest to see something like that. It tells them they are in the middle of no where.”I  toiled on. At sorepoint tumblereeds crossed my path.” This shows that he is losing hope in his mission to find his next destination. The environment affected the cyclist in every way, On his @CAPS1."	11185	
8186	3	"Cycling can be difficult but the thing that affects most cyclists is the setting. For example the rider might be somewhere where theras buildings and woods and other people which keeps there mind of the actual ride. But if they are in an environment which has nothing it takes a toke on you because all you can think about is @CAPS1 and rising. For example in the essay “Rough Road Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. The author explains that there is nothing around him for miles and he has to keep telling himself to go, but if your in an environment with things that distract you, you don’t have to think about it."	11186	
8187	3	"The features of the setting affect everything about the cyclist. The desert was extremely hot, uneven or hilly and deserted! He was also in an unfamiliar place, following directions from old men who were obviously not up to date on the roads. The cyclist was not worried about going the wrong way when it was stifling outside. The sun was beating down on him, which made him sweat more and require him to replenish his water. However, his water was low so all he could think about was the temperature! This feature of the setting drained on him physically, but it also effected him mentally because he could not ignore it. He said, ""??"" The uneven path took alot of energy out of him as well. He said, ""I noticed the terrain changing Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" If the terrain had stayed flat, his body would not have to work as hard. If the place was not deserted he could have stopped somewhere, replenished his water supply and maybe recieve new directions!  "	11187	
8188	3	"When the cyclist is riding, there are many things that affect him. One of these things is the setting. In the poem it says that it is extremely hot and the sun was beating down on him. This affected him because it made him easily dehidrated. The cyclist had a limited amount of water supply so when the sun made him dehidrated and thirsty, he couldn’t drink it. This made him not have as much energy to keep moving. Another aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist is the rolling hills. These hills make him exhausted because it takes a lot of energy to ride up the tall hills over and over again "	11188	
8189	3	"The cyclist in the essay, which opposes the cyclist and pushes him close to death, is the harsh environment in which the cyclist travels. The cyclist is stremously exercising in the smothering heat of June in a California desert. It is difficult enough for the  cyclist to travel across the flat desert road, but once the roads becomes rough and pepperd with hills, the cyclist energy is further depleted. The most brave as long crippling him after motion to worsen matters further the cyclist has unstable water, and cannot find my beyond “a table substance” that have the flavor of battery acid.” In addition to the inhospitable physical conditions of the environment in which the narrator tmels, the narrator is faced with depressing mental obstacles. Promised by the old men who give the cyclist advice the respite of human civilization, the cyclist despairs after encountering the abandoned outpost and ghost town after another perhaps the most crushing them of all was when the cyclist passes a forsaken welchy Grape Juice Factory. Physical and psychological emotions both contributes to making the cyclists journey a living hell."	11189	
8191	3	"The features and settings effect the cyclist through human vs.land.The man on the bike is constantly battleing the land and its elements. For example,“I could drop from a heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June.”This shows how the land can overpower the man on the bike and make his journey difficult."	11191	
8192	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. setting is the time or place that a story takes place. The cyclist faced a bad setting in this story because it was hot, in the day time, and it was a problem because he had a lack of water, and also a lack of which way to go. The weather was hot and dry, and this caused him to almost get dehydrated. If this biker would have gone biking in the @DATE1 time, he probably would not have been as hot, and also not have dehydrated, because the weather is cooler in the @DATE1. This biker was affected by the setting because he did not have enough water, and it was very dry where he was cycling, therefore, he couldn’t stop and get any more water. These dry, hot and muggy conditions almost caused the biker to pass out because of dehydration. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the biker was affected by the setting in numerous ways."	11192	
8193	3	One way to explain how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is by saying that it is not programed the right way and not ruing what to do in problems like that	11193	
8194	3	"The cyclist started out in a setting were he was surranded by flowing roads, sweet smelling air, with a light cool breeze. Then not long after that went into a fight, a battle for strength to see if he could test him self: The fight and the battle the cyclist fought with himself is the features of the setting. this offered the cyclist by comfronting him with a lot of challenges to overcome. Such as wild life mentiond in the story, as well as rolling hills, tumble weels, creating a coarsers, rougher environment to test himself in. In conclusion the setting affected the cyclist by no only testing himself physically but mentally as well to make himself belive he could accomplish the ride to down even with the obsico’s he feared infront of him."	11194	
8195	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is in the desert. You know this because the cyclist starts in “hodi California”. The author also says “I was travelling through high deserts of carlifornia” Because of this setting the author was in need of a lot of water, When the cyclist only had “a few tantalizing sips” the came to the “growing realization that drop from heatstroke”"	11195	
8196	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1,it says that the cyclist comes accross a ram shackle shed which was a troubling sight for him. This was troubling because it gave him the idea that the advice the old men gave him was old and not accurate. Another thing that affected him was seeing a huge snake, ""it really did look like a diamond back."" This was troubling because it blocked the majority of the pavement infront of him. He was scared after seeing it but eased past slowly. These are @NUM2 features that affected the cyclist."	11196	
8197	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the story, he was talking about how you shouldn’t take advice from old people because they are not with the world of today.This affects the cyclist because he didn’t listen to them. When he didn’t listen to them he got himself in a peck of trouble. When he round hope, he got advice from an even older man, but when he did, He got out of trouble and made it through ok.  "	11197	
8198	3	The cyclist in this story was affected by the setting in three main ways. First he got dehydrated. An example of this was when he was passing the snake on the road and said he could barely keep his balance as he passed by it. After that he started to get worn out. This becomes evidently when he said that with his last burst of energy he had to mandever down a hill. But through this all he gained the knowledge to not trust the directions of old people.	11198	
8199	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the biker to start off, was lacking in water supply. The temperature in the California deserts were scotchering. Not to mention the deadly animals he could have came in contact with. The atmosphere and terrain around him gave the biker an unbelievable challenge. He received terrible directs as well from a couple coagers."	11199	
8200	3	"I believe three features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. The horizon, the hills, and the empty ghost ""towns"" all helped him along his journey. He was riding perfectly confident on his way to Yosemite National Park when he was supposed to reach his first town, when actually all he found “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It was deserted and broken down. He couldn’t refuel his water or anything. You might think this hurt him, but actually it just gave him encouragement to make it to the next town. He was now determined to make it to the next town and fill up his water. Just like the “ghost town” the horizon and the hills helped him on his way and gave him hope to get to where he wanted to be. Each time he saw a hill he would tell himself that if he just made it up this one, he would find something usefull. He kept doing that on every hill and it helped him stay focused and continue on biking. The horizon did a similar thing. He would point to places on the horizon and tell himself that once he got there he would be fine. And again it kept him determined and made him keep biking and not give up."	11200	
8201	3	"As a cyclist,peddling in heat with no water is a bad start.It was too hot.""The sun was beginning to beat down.""posiness snakes as well can kill a person.She could have been in deep trouble if she got bit.Todat snake bites kill a lot of people each year.when bking remember to bringwater and food aid."	11201	
8202	3	"In the story the setting affects the cyclists very badly, so badly that he breaks down and consumes thoughts of death. In the story the setting is so bad that the cyclist talks about death and is thinking of how bad he has it. His water is almost gone and feels like there was @NUM1 degree weather in the area. He says, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. "	11202	
8203	3	"From reading the text it is clear that changing features of the setting have a strong impact on the cyclist. When his adventure begins the cyclist remarks on the ""Town"" as he called it. At this point he is in high spirits, elated and ready to continue on his trip. His attitude changes, however, once he reaches the next town. When he stops to get water we can almost feel his spirit drop as nothing but a tarlike substance cozes out from the pump. As he continues on the states once again that the terrain is changing. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills he claimed. In this section of his your journey we start to see the cyclist become nervous about his water supply. He begins to feel isolated and even laughs at the fact that he could possibly die once he reaches the old juice factory it would appear as though he has lost all hope. ""With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat,"" @CAPS1, the setting makes one final change. However, this time it’s for the better. He finally stumbles upon an old built shop, where he renews not only his thirst, but also his spirit.         "	11203	
8204	3	People shudn't not at night because we can’t see and the might get hint really I got thouht people mght get hurt. the effect is sun.	11204	
8205	3	"During the story the setting changes. From first making the cyclist feeling confident to making the cyclist feel as if he was dying. For example, in the beggining of the story he says “ the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them as if that would help him move along. After he on the road for the longest time he started getting exhausted. For example he says, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake as if the harder it got for him to pettle the rougher terrain on the road got."	11205	
8206	3	"One of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the “short rolling hills”  the narrator talks about. After the first “town” the guy comes into contact with rolling hills. After he’d been traveling on a flat road all day with no water. He now has to pedal harder and use up more energy. Another feature is that it was very hot out and he even comments on how he could get heat stroke, “I could drop from the heat stroke “ and drop down in the middle of the desert. In conclusion i believe that the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist, seeing as he could’ve died or severely hurt himself thanks to the setting."	11206	
8207	3	In the short story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by slowing him down or making him very tired along his bike ride. The sun was burning the read wasn’t very Flat so things got tough for him.	11207	
8208	3	"Surroundings can have a large affect on a person. If you are in a familiar place you will be happy. However, if you are in a strange, new place, you can feel frishtened or cautious. In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is riding in the desert of California on a hot @DATE1. His surroundings are hills, a little deserted town and lots of desert. These surroundings combined with lack of water, made the cyclist nervous and despret. Many times in the story he gave up hope. For example on page @NUM1, he says “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die…”The cyclist makes it through his terrifying journey but the desert and his surroundings made this journey very difficult."	11208	
8209	3	"The setting greatly affects the cyclist. It is a hot day in June, causing  him dehydration. Also, he has to pedal his way up and down hills and bumpy roads. A side from that, he must get away from a snake. If the setting was nicer, there would be no problems."	11209	
8210	3	"The setting in the story, “Rough Road: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” was a huge disadvantage to the cycilist. He was out in the middle of no where, which made it hard for him to find water. In the story, it says, ""I arrived at the first town."" The author can’t truly call it a town because it’s so isolated and run down that it hardly exists. During the authors trip, he says, “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” Then he goes on saying the snake was a diamond back, which are very dangerous. If that snake bit the author, he would have died right there, because there was no one to help him. Finally, the author has no source of water, and wont until he reaches his final destination. It says, “ A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water.” There’s no way this man could drink this water without feeling sick. All of the small problems this man faces could, have added up to be a terrible death for this man. But luckily for him, everything turned out to be just fine."	11210	
8211	3	"Many features in the setting affect cyclist. For example, roads could be windy, rocky, and bumpy. Or they could be normal which alows the cyclist to have a nice ride. Also climate affects cyclist to. For example, if it is to hot like it was in the story “Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit”, cyclist could go dehydrated. Many things affect a cyclist bike ride."	11211	
8212	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was going through a very dry deserted area. At first he was fine until he started to run out of water, and “twenty miles up the road I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t holld in the lamest mule greeted me two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” If he were in the city where he could get water anywhere he would be fine, but he is in the middle of a desert, with nothing for miles. This was like a time when my family went hiking for three days. When we had come to the last part of the trip, my dad looked at the map and thought the fork in the road, the left, led to a shortcut. Well as we found out it didnt, but only led to us having to walk through a bunch of thorny bushes that scratched us all up. Its not always easy to take the shortcut, and just go the way you know."	11212	
8213	3	The features and settings affect the cyclist by his mood changing when these things change. The cyclist begins happy when he thinks he knows where he is going and the ground is flat and smooth. Then the cyclist is low on water and becomes nervous and sure that is when hills and rough roads be come the terrain. Finally the cyclist is relieved when civilization becomes the terrain when he sees” gary and @PERSON1's fish camp” and gets water. The settings and features show the emotion the cyclist is going through.	11213	
8214	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the setting has a dramatic affect on the cyclist. For example, the author and/or cyclist describes a hill during his ride as “one long, crippling hill” (@NUM1) This shows that the hill was very steep and hard to get over for the cyclist. Another example of the setting having an affect on the cyclist is when he had to avoid obstacles on the road and still stay balanced. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. I eased past, trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” (@NUM1) This quote tells the reader that the cyclist had to be mentally as well as physically aware to avoid obstacles in his path. The quote, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” (@NUM3) shows that the cyclist was so close to just giving up on getting to Yosemite, until he got to the bait shop where he finally got to “stumble into a bathroom and drink deeply from the sink” (@NUM3) This quote shows that the cyclist has most likely gotten through the tough part of his journey and is well on his way to Yosemite."	11214	
8215	3	Features of the setting affect cyclsit because it could cause them to need more water. The heat could cause more sweating. Hills could require more leg power as distance. The distance from town to town is the bigest thing that could affect the cyclist.	11215	
8216	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For example the essay stated “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” those deserts would get very hot, and therefore, would wear him out faster, and make him use his water supply quicker than he would’ve normally, which leads to hisdehydration. Also, the author says “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced with short, rolling hills.” Hills are much harder on the body than flat road, and would also wear him out faster. The highway sign “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit"" affected him as well, it discouraged him quite a bit, because being on the flat terrain was wearing him out as it is. The town which he describes as “it fit the traditional description of a ghost town.” This affected him because he was slowly, beginning to realize the old “codgers” information was out dated. There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist, however, these are only a few of them."	11216	
8217	3	The setting deninetly made it intence it was very dry and human. Also the place was very unpopulated. The roads were very winedy and dangerous plus hot.	11217	
8218	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit by Joe @CAPS1 the setting affect the cyclist by the hot weather with little water. The oldmen telling him"	11218	
8219	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclest because the roads were bumpy and the weather was unbearable	11219	
8220	3	In the story the cyclsit is overcome with many problems facing him. He comes in counter with a diamond back snake which are deadly to us. His biggest problem though is not that. He has no water left that threats his life. Without water he can die from the heat. While	11220	
8221	3	"The story takes place in a California, desert which can be very scary, especially for a cyclist. The boy in the story hits trouble when he asks some old men for directions to Yosemite. The old men give the boy out of date directions which leads to problems for the boy. During his ‘short cut” the men gave him the boy drinks almost all of his water. So he is destined find something to drink. On his way to the next town the boy comes accost a dimonond back snake, which he says is so big it covers almost all of the pavement. That really takes on effect on him because he doesn’t know if the snake could reach up and bite him. When the boy comes across a building he thinks has water it ends up being deserted. The boy thinks in fear because he thinks he is going to die. The boy is so dehydratd he puts rocks in his mouth. When he does that he says” maybe I will hit a bump and one will loge into my throut“ when he says that he just wants to dies because everything around him is useless for his thirst settings can have a big effect on people.  "	11221	
8222	3	"During his trip to Yosemite, the cyclist endured many challenges because of the setting that only his will power and determination could overcome. The first and foremost drawback would be the dry climate and lack of water. Because of the intense heat and sandy terraine, there was no water, nor cool areas for him to recooperate from dehydration until he reached the bait shop. The area he was riding through was desserted and therfor only leaving tumble weeds on the 55 mph abandoned roads. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine”. The cyclist felt anxiety from the wide open area, no one to help him his fear of a heart stroke came true, and no place to go if he needed water, The setting of any situation effects the final outcome, but Joe kurmaskie dealt with the driest climate and the cruelest conditions"	11222	
8223	3	"The cyclist is facing a tough challenge, and at First has a positive attitude. He starts in the morning, it’s sunny and cool out,  his mood is light and   ready   to get started. He is in the desert so he brings a lot oF water and @CAPS1 very prepared since he got directions with a short cut From some men the night before. Towards the middle of the day, he is running out of water and the day, is very hot. The cyclist thinks he should be @CAPS2 some towns soon, but when he reaches them, they are deserted. He struggles with nature and his self For hours and truely thinks he is going to die. Eventually he finds a store and gets enough water to drink and @CAPS1 better. He decides to follow the maD and to go with your instinct. This story is about facing challenge s and   over comming them. Every little hill was just getting him closer to his and goal. Never give up on yourself."	11223	
8224	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. As the story starts the setting is described as a reservoir campground that was peaceful and relaxing. As the man rides his bike the setting shifts and ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" As the cyclist continued to ride and the roads get rougher the man because dehydrated and the setting affected him.  "	11224	
8225	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", by Joe kurmaskie are that the Road is bad there are snakes and hes low on water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” That means hes really low and has like nothing left. He thought he was going to die because of the heat ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean.” He wasn’t being positive about it. Also he couldn’t find anyone in sight to help him. This shows that there were many cautions to the trip."	11225	
8226	3	The features that effect the cyclist is that he belive that the the mens that was on the pout knew what they was talk about. Also the people know was that they told him the  wernge way. Another reson is that the people on the the pout have went out in along time.	11226	
8227	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it lets him know what his resources are and much of it he has. For example if I was riding a bike and I saw a seven elleven I would have some time to get food and start for the ride but if you don’t have a seven elleven you cant stop to get food and stuff for the ride and you start to panic like the cyclist did in the story “rough road ahead @CAPS1 not exceed posted speed limit.” @CAPS2 if there are people around you could ask them for directions and wich has is the fastest rout.	11227	
8228	3	"The setting affecting the cyclist is that he would know how this place looks like. For example in the essay it says that “At some point, tumbleweeds aroused my path and a ridiculously large snake” it really did look like diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS1 he knows know that he is going over a snake and the rodes aren’t good enough to drive. For example if you are in the forest and what is need  or what you do, well it like the essay is. This is how the setting affect the cyclist.     "	11228	
8229	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist Because.It was @CAPS1 Dry and @CAPS2 like.It read “Rough Road Ahead…”and “I was tired travelling through the high deserts of California in June.”	11229	
8230	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. So, the sun was probably beating down on him making it hard for him to pedal. For example, it says ''The water wouldn‘t cool down. ''I think this means that the heat made the water hot. @CAPS2, their is nothing around the cyclist Where he is riding, so the cyclist cannot get water or @CAPS1. For example, in the essay it states ''There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure oF any kind, @CAPS2, it shows him riding by nothing but grass and tumbleweeds. Last, is how the setting includes diFFerent obstacles the cyclist has to overcome. For example, he had to ride through a rough raod and by poisonus snakes. It says in the essay ''A large snake bloked a majority oF the pavement'' and this caused him to ease past while keeping his balance. In conclusion, that is how the Features of the setting aFFect the cyclist in many ways."	11230	
8231	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist. The speaker thought the journey from Lodi, California to Yosemite would be a mildly pleasant road to travel. However, after @NUM1 miles the cyclist encountered his first difficult land feature -the deserts of California. The heat of the desert in June left him dehydrated. This affected his inability to travel quickly with a clear mind; he was tired and thirsty. Following the desert were hills that left his legs aching and his body exhausted. It seems that the cyclist was ill-prepared for his voyage. Nature was able to overcome him, and the speaker thought that he would die, and if he did not come upon the fish camp, it is likely that he would have.  The land features of the strenous journey had a negative affect on the atmosphere of his trip.  "	11231	
8232	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways such as his mood. When he looked young and saw he didn’t know where he was there was dry land that looked like desert and he didnt have dry water he was angry, I know this because in the story it said, “it was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.”So this proves he was he was having an angry mood towards himself and the olds people who gave him that advice to go there and for him actually listen. But he showed strength to keep trying to look for water so he would not eventually die. Throughout the story  his  mood  changed  so much he went through times of being happy, sad, mod and even thinking he was going to die. The things that surrounded him when the building that he needed to get to for water made his mood very happy so you see how the setting can affect the way a person’s mood is in every way."	11232	
8233	3	"In the text “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affected the cyclist. Cyclist in this text means when a person is cycling information to one person to another… In this case, the person in the text is getting the information from the cyclist that is an “old timers”.  But you shouldn’t because the information could be false and for the character in the text she took it. This is affected because if she wouldn't have took the information it would be such an effect in the text. "	11233

In the essay a young cyclist asks a group of old men for directions to Yosemite, a national park, later on, the cyclist discovers that the directions were out of date and incorrect, which led him to a very difficult bike ride. On the bike ride, the cyclist becomes dehydrated and extremely tired. Soon the features of the setting affected him. “@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path” would give the cyclist even more evidence that he is in the middle of nowhere and would make him think that he would never make it to Yosemite. Also as the cyclist peddled over “crippling hills”, he became even more exhausted. Later the cyclist is let down by an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice Factory that he thought would be a helpful building. The picture of a “young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” would affect the cyclist making him feel more  thirsty so he would long even more for a drink. These features discouraged the cyclist."	11234	
8235	3	"The cyclist had a very crucial journey. His effororts would not have been so bad if it weren’t for the setting around him. One of the problems was the hills. Hills are never good because if you go down one, you speed up but if you go up one, it’s harder work. Another obstacle that the cyclist had to overcome was that he had lost almost all of his water. He was in the desert so if  he  did need anything, it would be water. The last thing that make it hard for the cyclist was the conditions of the road. The conditions of the road were so bad that it made almost everything hard to do. The setting conditions had the biggest effect on the cyclist because if things weren’t so bad, it wouldn’t have been so hard."	11235

This is, most likly, b/c of the setting, b/c the cyclist is becoming dehidrated he then becomes angrey @ himself then the “all timers” he most likly is also angrey because he is riding in a desert, however if was riding through a happy little road w/ grass on a cool day his mood would have been much better."	11237

The story’s setting is very hot; and the temperature is very high. In the story it says “followed by the brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” (kurmaskie ). The quote describes that the cyclist is very thirsty and is hot. It also says “I could drop from heatstroke” (kurmaskie). This also describes that the cyclist is over heated due to to hot temperature. The features of the setting make the cyclist think back to the bad directions and simply want to have water. This is why the settings affect the cyclist."	11239

For example if it were a nice cool day and he wasn’t on some ""short cut"" @PERCENT1 sure about he @MONTH1 have been much more relaxed and actually enjoyed his ride instead of just trying to endure it with every and of charge he had.

8242	3	"In @PERSON1 essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit” the setting greatly affected the cyclist. The story takes place in June in the high deserts of California.” The speaker was travelling on rough roads and through ghost towns. He encountered obsticles such as tumbleweeds and “a ridiculously large snake,” however, the speakers biggest challenge during his journey was the luck of water to quench his thirst on that hot summer day. All of these factors affected the cyclist and made him feel that he “was going to die” and be left for the birds to pick [him] clean.” @CAPS1 these factors the cyclist could have completed his journey much easier. Travelling on a cool @DATE2 morning, on a nice flat road, with facilitys for water would have eliminated most of the speakers challenges. This proves that the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclists journey."	11242	
8243	3	"The setting, in the cyclist’s journey, makes it harder for him to continue. The ghost town, water stop, empty juice factory and rolling hills did not help him at all, it only wasted his time and made it harder for him to continue.

Later in the story, cyclist comes to some rolling hills. He then becomes very tired do to the setting he is in."	11245

If the author had been travelling in cold weather, the outcome of the story would have been completely different. The author’s first main setting obstacle was the “ramshackle shed” Since he was in hot weather, his water was quickly running out. The pump he attempted to get water from was at no help when it oozed out a “tarlike substance.” Next the author would come to an abandoned building that was once a Welch’s grade juice factory. Once again there was no water. This setting discouraged the author, leading him to believe he would die in the hot sun. Finally he comes upon a bait shop, where relief was offered.

8255	3	"The stettings affect the cyclist in several ways. One way is dehydration. Due to the heat and openness of the desert, with limited water supply one could easily become dehydrated if he was to get lost. Another way could be increased anxioty and nervousness. This could come about after not being able to find your way, This increases heart rate and other key factors. A third way is the fear of deadly animals. This could also increase heat rate, and make your body go through water faster."	11255	
8256	3	"The features in the settings are important. On this ride, he is supposed to feel relaxed. Nobody could ride a bike relaxed on rocks with a bunch of bugs bothering you. So the author made him riding on a road in the middle of nowhere, with no cars around. In a spot like that even a guy that hates riding bikes could feel relaxed."	11256	
8257	3	"There are many things affect the cyclist in this story. The main thing affect is the features of where he is riding. Features is the way something @MONTH1 lack of food. For example, the harder the ride got the more exhausted the cyclist got. Also, when I got towards the middle of the day the temperature rose and the cyclist got even more tired. Therefore the warmer it got and the harder the features got the more tired the cyclist got."	11257	
8258	3	There are many features in wich affect the cyclist along his journey. When he leaves it is very hot he said it was June. The simple terrain became rough as he approached the sign Rough Road Ahead. He runs out of water and becomes dehydrated.	11258	
8259	3	"The features of the settings affect the cyclist alot because he is cycling to Yosemite National Park. It’s sometime in June, making the weather hot. The cyclist took directions for a “shortcut” to Yosemite from a bunch of old-timers. The “shortcut” was though the middle of nowhere. And with it being a hot day, he drinks alot of water. But there is nowhere for him to stop and get some more. The first “town” he did come across had a water pump. He tried it but only a tar like substance came out at first. Then followed by brackish water that was hot and tasted like battery acid.    "	11259	
8260	3	"There are many settings changes that effect the cyclist in extreme ways. In the beginning he rides into his first ""town"" as he calls it which is really a ghost town. This doesn’t let the cyclist down too much though as he is still thinking of his goal destination. He states,""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name writen all over them."" The cyclist still has a positive outlook at this point. The next location he arrive at is another deserted town consisting of a ramshackled shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the larnest muk greeted me.""  The cyclists tone is getting more negative as his thirst grows. He states,"" I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1, the reader associates deserts, California, and June with heat. He explains his water is of ""two  hundred   degrees"" making his journey even more horrifying. He cames to relize that the flat terrain is now short, rolling hills and then it’s a highway. To make matters he states,""tumble weeds crossed my path and a large snake blocked the pavement."" All of these factors affected to cyclist negatively."	11260	
8261	3	"In the article “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist has many setting affecting his ride. One the cyclist has is the setting of the hot California desert in June. This caused him to become dehydrated and drink all his water in the story he said “ I got down on my hands and knees working  the handle of the  rusted water pump with all my strength.” The cyclist was running out water and he couldn’t get anymore. The cyclist also had to face bad road conditions he said “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “with no water and being dehydrated this was challenge he set out to concure and he acheivedd it"	11261	
8262	3	"The arid climate of the area in which the author cycled proved to be a challenging and near-fatal run-in with the cruelties of @ORGANIZATION1. In the essay, the author’s main problem is lack of water. Granted, that would be a problem for pretty much anyone traveling a long distance, but cycling is a very physical activity, and this man’s cycling then led him through a very hot, dry climate. Several times in this essay, the author states that he was of the opinion that the advice the old man had given was utterly useless and that he was approaching his death. Everyone needs water to survive, especially those who are out in the heat of the desert performing very physical tasks. The lack of water, then seems to have worn down the cyclist’s psyche to the point where he regarded his own death with bitter, hopelessness. Luckily, he spotted a place where he could find drinkable water, and with it he received not only hydratich, but hope. After replenishing his water supply, the cyclists could move on."	11262	
8263	3	There was no water around because he went up hills and through the desert and when he went to the town there was nobody there to help him. 	11263	
8264	3	"Features like the hot sun in June, affect the cyclist in a negative way because it makes him like he is not going to make it. Also features like bumpy road'in the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way, it makes him feel danger. All around the features of the setting are negative to the cyclist."	11264	
8265	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting negatively affects the cyclist. The fact that there was no one in sight and no structures, there was a lack of water for the rider. The road blocks and poisonous snakes delayed his jorney. The road was in terrible condition which caused him to have to drive slower. If the features of the setting weren’t this way then the journey wouldn’t have been so negative."	11265	
8266	3	"In the settling of ""Rough Road ahead"" there are many features of setting that affect the cyclist. In the story one of the main settings that affects the cyclist is the desert climate. For example the cyclist says. ""The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June."" He was realizing that the climate was going to kill him. The climate was much do hot, he knew if he didn't get town quickly he would die. Just like example me when i was a child. I was lost in the woods with my brother @CAPS1. We were exhausted out of water and lost. Justlike the cyclist; ""all becaus I listened to some gentlemen who didn't been of f there porch in decades. that was why he was lost, rather then using his map and his out he tried the easy way out along directions. Just like me rather then to having instinct and not going into the vast on known woods, we want any way."	11266	
8267	3	"The cyclist takes a shortcut through desserted desert, leaving him tired and dehydrated. The setting he is in is a desert in the middle of June. The sun is beating down, and the cyclist sweats himself into dehydration. There are no occupied towns along the way and the only water pump he finds is no good. His thirst starts to get the best of him and he almost passes out. He is also in hilly country that has ""torn-up"" roads. This wears him out even more, contributing to his dehydration. He becomes exhausted, not thinking he can go on any further. When he finds a fish camp with sinks full of water. This cyclist is surrounding environment makes his ""shortcut"" even more tiring and dehydrating than a normal road."	11267	
8268	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it looks like it is very hot, and it looks like he is in a desert in the middle of nowhere so if he falls off of his bike and gets injured there would be nobody around to help him. He could also run out of gas, and stuck in the desert. "	11268	
8269	3	"The cyclist was mainly affected by lack of water in the essay but the features such as the rolling hills, rough terrain, hot weather, and lack of people really get him into trouble. First he encounters “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” No one is around to offer him help with directions or water. The next problem was his lack of water. At the next abandoned town he tries a pump but the water “had the flavor of battery acid.” Then came a terrain change. A sign reads “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” He now has the feature of rolling hills with the rough terrain and has the growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke”. The hot weather is the last feature that gets him down. In conclusion, due to rough terrain, weather, and absence of people the author is affected greatly on his ride."	11269	
8270	3	The setting affects the cyclist for many reasons heres why. One way the setting will effect him is that if his terrain is rough to ride through than he my not make it in time.	11270	
8271	3	"Every feature of that setting was against the cyclist. The snake, heat, lack of water, & hills. The worst feature of the area was the old men. There the worst because they started the whole problem in the first place. But they also taught the cyclist not to believe everything you hear. The others weren’t helpful either. The lack of water almost killed him & so did the heat. The snake wasn’t that bad but the hills took his energy. that’s how they affected the cyclist."	11271	
8272	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when he went through the desert in California he got really thirsty and drank a lot of his water. Also author one was like the time said something about a rough road. That meant that he had to go slower than vowed because he was to not loose control and fall on anything. Finally another thing that affected him would be when he saw the buildings and there for sure he forgot about the thirst and anything and he just want as included as just trying to get there.	11272	
8273	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist listened to a bunch of old codgers about a short cut to Yosemite National Park. He took the short cut and road his bike. The namaton says “The sun was beginning to beat down,” He was in the middle of the desert and it was just starting to get hot. Then the namaton talks about the changing terrain. He says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The namaton was already becoming dehydrated add a couple of hills to the equation, you have death working square and the eyes. We all know terrain can affect your physical ability but when adding the desert you must think very carefully about what you are going up against."	11273	
8274	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I’m guss because it not tell a lot of detail to the features and stuff like that but I really thing it is because the cyclist isn’t list all of the cyc that what I thing that why it call a cyc list list all of the features of the story movies etc. So that is all what I think it is about.	11274	
8275	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclsit mentally, physically, and emotionally. From what yous see and feel around you, that will determine your state of mind. Through this essay, the signs of mental, physical, and emotional states will be determined by the setting. Mentally, the cyclist was stressed out and kind upset. He kept little details in mind that he believed were there. For example, I’ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate”, this means that in his mind he tried to believe he was not dehydrated. Physically, he was weared out, tired, and dehydrated. He had no energy to keep going. The hills had no energy to keep going. The hills had tired him out and he seemed to would have been close to death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. He believed he would have died but his determination proved otherwise. Emotionally, he was angry at himself to have listened to old men that had no idea what they were talking about. The setting, was dry, lonel, and abanadoned. This made the cyclsit feel he was going to be abandoned as well. The cyclist had a strong mind."	11275	
8276	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist because he is in the desert. The heat and the terrain affect him because it makes him thirsty and tired. For example in the text it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” This is the cyclists explaining how he only has a little water left and he is sweating a lot. The heat of the desert and the terrain do this to him. I have played many sports and activities in the heat and the heat and terrain affect me as well."	11276	
8277	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist badly. When he sees the first town he wasn’t really affected. He thought it was funny and kept going. Since he was in the desert he needed water, but since he was biking he needed a lot of water. So when he came to the pumps and they didn’t work he thought he could make it to the next town. He kept riding and saw the town wasn’t so close so he thought he was going to die. It’s a hot June day in the desert and the cyclist runs out of water so naturally he gets worried. He gets excited when he sees a building, but upset when he sees it’s abandoned. I t was the fact that he was to a desert that affected him most becasue it’s hot there and he was worried that he would dehydrate. The author’s use of description helped to show the selling which helped show how the cyclist was affected by it."	11277	
8279	3	"In the setting of the story’ Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, there are many obsricals the cyclist had to overcome in the setting. One thing was is that it was very hot. According to the author it was June and in a California desert. It states,” I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, cited from paragraph five. Also, it was very dangerous for a couple of reasons. One, there were deadly animals out when he was, “ Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the parmat in front of me,” cited paragraph ten. Secondly, there was rough terrain  that he had to go through like plants over running the road, and the road being tough itself, “ I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rollay hills,” cited paragraph eight. Also, he was lacking water. He was lacking water because he was very hot in the desert and he needed hydrator. “ I eased past , trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” cited paragraph ten. So as you can see, the cyclist in the story, Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, made it through many hardships in the setting."	11279	
8280	3	The setting of the narrative is of a desolate vast land full of hazards and a lack of water. If he had fallen from the bribe and imagined himself it could be hours or even days before someone found him. Also it that port of the country the wild life can kill you or large collection of poisonous snakes and even the only known poisonous lizard. To her he had left the road wildlife becomes a big risk. A third hazard is water. The leading cause of death in the desert is dehidration. A lack of water could cause some of her major organs to fail gameteeing himself of death. Also when he get to the water from the old hard pump there could be an enomouse amount of lachle miorols in the small sip he took. In the end his dission to take the moist vithonst doing the no checks is a very foolish action in his point.	11280	
8281	3	The setting effects the cycles that it becomes really hot at one point. That he can ran out of water. He rides by poisonous snanks. The weather can have and effect on how fast or slow he goes the road how it changes from flat to trans makeing it harder to ride. Also you have to put more energy in to rideing the bike. If their is alot of traffic it can slow you down and make it unsafe at times. Their are many features that can effect the cycles when they are riding 	11281	
8282	3	"All the feature do affect the cyclist. When things start to change the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down…” One of the first sights were troubling. The author experienced water shortage, the heat, and a snake. It was really hot and he was sweating. You are supposed to drink a lot of water, but he was running out. It is hard to ride a bike when extremely hot. Furthermore, the terrain started to change. There were flat road for short rolling hills. He came to a sign that said “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”. The road changing really affected the cyclist because it was harder to pedal. Going up hills inquire more strength than riding on a flat surface. In addition the first building he came across nobody was there so his mood was affected. He was discouraged until he came across the fish camp where a man helped him. The feature of the setting are a very important way of affecting the cyclist. It affects its strength and mood. Also if roads were all flat, it would be as much of a disadvantage for the cyclist."	11282	
8283	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist enormously. From the beginning, the cyclist is battling the terrain. It in home that the first fourty miles he was energized and not tired, but shortly often following the “codgers” advice, the old men on the porch, he was heading into trouble. First, the cyclist encounters a lack of water. The text says, “This sight was troubling, It had been hotting any water bottles metty regularly and, it was traveling through high deserts of California June. Therefore, the cyclist was California hasidty running on empty in scarching heat. Which is not very pleasant. Next, the cyclist encounters rugged terrain and an obstacle. The text says, “The speed limit was 55 mph it was doing a water depleted 12 mph it noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.'' @CAPS1 after, he encountered what he believe to be a diamond back snake. Although, in the end, dehidrated and fueled only by determination to assuage his thirst he found a fish camp. From “a rather modern bathroom (he) drank deeply from the sink.” This remindes me of war. You go into war excited to serve your country and hopeful that you are going to triumph. Then, time passes painfully and determination is the only feeling running you on day after guiding day. Finally, the war ends and you are changed forever like the cyclist was, the cyclist would never ask an elderly person for directons again.      "	11283	
8284	3	In the story ‘Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist’s hydration. He drives for a long time in a desert-like place and runs out of water. He says “I was travelling through the high deserts of California the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” (@NUM1). This proves the features of the setting is bad and potentially dangerous. 	11284	
10643	4	"Moving from place to place, even in the same country, is a difficult thing to do. Saeng has moved away from everything she;s ever know, and she is very sad. The winter hibiscus gives her a new hope in her new home that things will get better and that she will be able to adapt. The author finishes the story with saeng’s vow to re-take the test in the spring to emphasize her new home. The author uses three things in saeng’s vow that are very important and show how saeng is adapting. Saeng vows that she will take the test again “when the snows melt”. Saeng is relating time to her new and old homes. She also says that she will take the test again when “the geese return “. This shows her relating time to her new @CAPS1 home. She finally relates time to her old home when she says she will take the test when “thishibiscus is budding.” @CAPS2 three events express saeng’s thinking as to where she lives. She lists the hibiscus last because it reminds her of her old home and is most important to her. The author put this vow last so as to express saeng’s determination. "	13643	
10644	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its the end and so we have an idea of what is coming next.	13644	
10645	4	"I guess since she failed the test once, she'll go back to take the test, Just like the geese threy migRate to the south duRing the winteR, then come back in the spRing. Since She knows that the test was like, she'll go back to take the test again, but with moRe confidence.I guess since she failed the test once, she'll go back to take the test, just like the geese they migRate to the south duRing the winteR, then come back in the spRing. Since she knows that the test was like, she'll go back to take the test again, but with moRe confidence."	13645	
10646	4	"I believe that the author included the last paragraph because it shows Saeng’s realization and understanding. I believe that Saeng realized that between the birds and the plants, she felt like she knew it. The text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition season upon season, almost, familiar to her now.” I believe the author used the geese to show this realization because they are creatures of repetition, and it showed her that she needed to build up her strength and keep trying.   "	13646	
10647	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s particular thought to put emphasis on the hibiscus’s meaning to Saeng. Along with other things, the hibiscus reminds Saeng of her old homeland. It provides comfort for her and helps her relive old memories when she was back home. She has been  having trouble adjusting to her new life and the hibiscus acts as a motivational tool. Moving can be a difficult process, especially when it’s to a foreign country. So you can imagine Saeng not being completely focused. With her new discovery, she can adjust easier and possibly pass the test this time knowing the comfort she has recently found with a simple plant. The author’s purpose for closing the story in the way that he did was to emphasize the feeling of comfort when you are far from home and how it can come in the strangest places."	13647	
10648	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants the reader to know that the girl will try everything again to be successful. She failed the test and was sad about it so she thinks that the hibiscus will give her confidence and she will be ready for the test when it grows back.	13648	
10649	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she wanted to explain that when she took the test for the first time, it was winter. The expressed information was the @CAPS1 Geese. It means that it is getting cold so they fly south to get warmer. The other expressed information is “when the snows melt and the geese return, then I will take that test again”. It means that she will have more confidence in herself then the first time she took that test. The final expressed information is the car. It means that time is going by fast so the hibiscus will be blooming soon. That is why the author concludes the story about the paragraph  "	13649	
10650	4	"The author includes this passage to show that she is trying to adapt to her new environment, but it is a hard thing to do. She is just not ready to overcome the sadness of her missing her home land. It takes time and effort to achieve the thing you want. You must set goals for yourself. ’’If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try again.’’ Saeng failed at her goal of trying to adapt, but she didn’t give up, she gave herself more time. This passage demonstrates ambition and hard work will help you achieve your goals, even the seemingly impossible ones.   "	13650	
10651	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s conclusion is used to bring the piece to an end. She says the ending paragraph to herself in hopes at inner peace. In the story the main character had failed her driving test and bought a plant with her mother’s money to cope with the failure. The ending sentances are self talk by the main character, Saeng. She says “in the spring… I will take that test again.” Saeng shows her pride and hope because she believes if she keeps trying she can pass."	13651	
10652	4	Saeng states that when spring arrives and she has more confidence she will take the test again .When hibiscus comes back to life in the spring and Saeng  ros	13652	
10653	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it keeps the story logically organized, infers that when the geese come back she will be ready and more confident in taking the exam, and it gives Saeng about @NUM1 months to get settled into @LOCATION1 and grow up with the Winter hibiscus. The author keeps the story logically organized by going in chronoligical order and putting this paragraph at the end is perfect because what goes on in the paragraph is in the future. When the geese come back, she will have had much time to prepare for the exam. Lastly, as she grows up with the hibiscus, she is growing stronger as an individual and will be able to face any challenge that comes in her way."	13653	
10654	4	"The story was taking place in a difficult time for Saeng. She was feeling detached from her beloved homeland and her grandmother, and was still having difficulty adjusting to the @CAPS1 lifestyle. To add on to things she had just failed her driving test, which was just another blow to her current state of mind. It was just a really rough time for her when she found and bought the hibiscus plant which brought back memories that she had been missing. The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to show that with a little help from her family and a little bit of support from the small piece of her old culture that she bought ad planted, she found new strength. “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters. “This quote bz the mother is sort of like a metaphor for Saeng’s situation. If the flower had the strength to make it through challenging, harsh times, then Saeng had to have the strength to and in time, things would get better."	13654	
10655	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it tells you how much gardening really means to her. It says “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” That is saying that when she cant garden anymore she will take the test again. Other then that she is not worryed about it."	13655	
10656	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its saying that when spring comes around that she will go on and finsh planting and take the test again.	13656	
10657	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concluded the story in the way she did to show hope and progress. When Saeng came to this new country she desperately missed her homeland. It seemed that her only comfort was her memories and the flowers helped to embody these recollections. Saeng’s mention of taking the test when the hibiscus buds, implies that she will need time, like the flower to adapt and bud, but she shows hope for progress in pomising this to herself. Saeng’s past is weighing on her shouldrs and it is her burden like the snow burdens the flower. So when she say, “When the snows melt…” She means that when she accepts her past and her burden is lifted, she will take the test and progress onward. These last words are saturated with the hope the new flower gives Saeng and her dreams of progress begin to unfurl.  "	13657	
10658	4	"The tag line at the end of the story is a happy end to it. The story goes in depth about how she feels lost and down, so when she has that, it makes the tone happy. In this new country Saeng feels lost, and is having trouble finding herself. She does not have many friends, and is confused with the new customs. She fails her driving test, getting her even more sad and it seems as nothing can get her happy. She then buys a hybiscus @CAPS1 reminding her of home. It smelled like her grandmother, who she loved. The @CAPS1 gave her peace at a time when she needed it. At the end she showed courage saying, “I will take that test again”, and is becoming a more confident, happy, forgiving indivual. This story gives new beginning to the term “@CAPS1 power”."	13658	
10659	4	"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the text says that Saeng says that “I-I failed the test” and the last paragraph says that next year she will be ready to take the test again. Next, Saeng will take the drivers test when she is ready which she says will be next year when “ this hibiscus is budding” this means that Saeng will be “budding” just like the hibiscus, because the hibiscuss gives her strength. Saeng is also becoming more comfortable in her surroundings, because in the text it says that “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. This shows that she now realizes that she has no excuse now for her actions because everything has become normal to her now, without her even realizing it herself, just like the geese which has now become normal to her. In conclusion, the author specifically puts that paragraph in last for a reason."	13659	
10660	4	"In the story “Winter hibiscus” it ended with Saeng stating “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” The author ended the story like this to show how determined Saeng was to please her mother who she hates so much to disappoint her. In the story Saeng came home with a plant that she had payed with all the money she had, her mother stated “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” @CAPS1 she had disappointed her mother by trying to please her made Saeng want to do something to make her mom happy. This is what she means by “Then I will take that test again.” The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and of her mother. “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she know it would” this relates to the ending “and the hibiscus budding” because the hibiscus flower mean a lot to Saeng. In conclusion they use this ending to convey how much her mother means to her and to make her proud."	13660	
10661	4	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph because it reminds her of home. When the story stated she preferred the bitter melon than the Big Mac, It reminded her of home because she already ate a melon at home before. When she the jasmine in the store, it reminded her of putting a bud in her grandmother’s hair. When she said the hibiscus was not like the one at home, it obviously reminded her of her homeland. You also know that it reminds her of home because the story stated that the plants drew her back to her childhood world. When she went to buy the hibiscus plant, she knew all the plant names which implies that she has seen them before. The hibiscus is a good luck charm since she is going to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. I think she will pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of the details listed above."	13661	
10662	4	"The saying means that this spring she had not done well communication with her daughter, did not get along as much with her , Then she said that next year after all the snow has melted and the geese return and the hibiscus returns, she will try again brith communication and understanding her daughter."	13662	
10663	4	When the geese come back the must approve of the plant. She will be ready for them.	13663	
10664	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng would continue to do what she wants to do. It also shows that she didn't quit she want to @CAPS1 her goal that she set.	13664	
10665	4	We  when it gets because things can wants for winter and when it gets warm the geese come back.	13665	
10666	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is confident that she will pass the test after she had some time to get used to everything. The geese are animals who also have to move from their normal living area to an other place. The spring is often a symbol for a new beginning. When the cold snow is melting, the geese are coming back, the hibiscus is budding everything is starting over again. Also it something is not working like you have planned it you should not give up and just try again. Be confident."	13666	
10667	4	The author concludes the story like that because he or she wants to show the Saeng is committed to test even if she has to try again. It also showed that she loved what so might had wanted to try once more. It could be also that when the flower grows again and the geese come back. Thats might what keep her focus	13667	
10668	4	 Because she failed a test the first time and she buy a flower for her mom to help her feel her person that she failed the test. The flower would remind her mother  about her old home. The flower costs @MONEY1. Her mom yells at her before buying the flower that she realized that her driving intertains everything because she fail the test but she say next time will not fail it again.	13668	
10669	4	"At the end of the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ended the paragraph with that sentence because she was trying to show how serious Saeng wanted to be about the test. Saeng also seems to think that the hibiscus is a good luck charm because in the winter when she took the test, She failed. But in the spring when she retakes the test the hibiscus will be blooming, and Saeng thinks she will pass. As you can see, this is why the author ended the story / paragragh with that sentence."	13669	
10670	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus “ends the story on a strong note. The author makes the hibiscus plant seem so great.  Like the plant is motivation for saeng.  Unfortutnly  saeng doesn’t pass her test.She is very sad adont this and looks for something to comfort her She looks to the hibiscus plant. She vowes silently as a promise to herself that when that plant buds in spring  she will take the test again. She is kooking forward to seeing this beautiful plant bloom again. When it does she knows she will take the test. Saeng is determined as well. I’m confident that when she retakes the test she will pass. The main reason I feel the author ends this story like this because they want to show hope. They want to convey a sence of what is yet to come. When the flower blooms and is beautiful the time is just right to take the test. This test means a lot to saeng .so does the plant. Saeng uses the plant as motivation. Thats why the author chose to end the story they way they did. In conclusion this story is about getting motivated, and how even simple things like plants can remind you of your homeland. This then leads you to peace which leads you to happiness. That’s why the author ended the story the way they did.                   "	13670	
10671	4	"The concluding paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” is different from the other paragraphs. The author used this paragraph to show that she is determined to pass the test, and that she appreciates her new home and country. After failing her drivers test, Saeng came home with a plant from her home at Vietnam to give to her mother. In the last paragraph, it states “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take my test again.” This shows that she is determined to pass her driving test, which she failed the first time. Another reason she used that as the concluding paragraph was to show her appreciation for her new home and country. In the paragraph it states “and the geese return”. Canadian geese are only native to the United States and Canada. This shows that the author wants to show that Saeng appreciates her new country. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with this paragraph to show that she is determined to pass the test, and that she appreciates her new home."	13671	
10672	4	"The author add this last paragraph, so the short story would not put you to fare out of range to relise what you think was going to happen. Which I though I would of said something about the flowers and taking her test, and they usually @CAPS1 to show you the story over a few months."	13672	
10673	4	"When they cameback, saeng vowed to herself in the spring. When the snow melt and the geese return t this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again because she lifted her head and watched as their distinctine v uses etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. That why author concludes the story with this paragraph."	13673	
10674	4	"The girl in the story moved from Vietnam. From what she says about the birds returning, it could mean she wants to return to her country. She spent a lot of money on the hibiscus because it reminds her of home she failed her driving test. She said this so most likely she is determined. She is going to take the test in spring when snow melts. She most likely will not give up."	13674	
10675	4	"The author concludes the story with that phrase because it shows that Saeng is strong mentally. ""this hibiscus is budding”(HO). The hibiscus can be related to Saeng because it is cut of place, but it is a strong flower. “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here""(HO) Saeng is going to last through the cold month just like the flower will. “Look row root – bound it is”(HO). Saeng is still bound to her roots back home. She thinks about everything back home and cry’s. “Let’s plant it, right now” (HO). Planting the flower is like planting herself."	13675	
10676	4	"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because those are things that comfort her and will help her with her test. “when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched the petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel. “Saeng used to have a hibiscus at her home in Vietnam and to see it in the @CAPS1.S brought back a lot of  memories and comforted her. “overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and -yes –familiar to saeng now. “The geese are now familiar to her in the @LOCATION3 which is a comforting feeling to be familiar with something in her place. So the geese and the hibiscus buds will help comfort her and help her be calm and ready to re-take the test.  "	13676	
10677	4	"The author ends the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again.” because Winter and spring have a symbolic meaning, to Saeng. Winter is cold and isn’t easy to get through, Saeng is still struggling to adapt her new home. When she saw the Jasmine plant it brought back memortes of her grandmother and Vietnam. She then felt “A wave of loss so deep and strong."" This loss of her home is hard for her to process. Winter is the same thing. Spring represents renewal of things the start of something new, Saeng at the story’s end “realized that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" she realized she has made a home . When the spring arrives she can start again on life. The same thing she had to do coming to a new land. The adjusting was her winter and the spring is her new start symbolize what she’ll do. What she want to do is take her driver’s test again to initiate her new start."	13677	
10678	4	The author put this in the storie because the teenage girl is pregnant.They  thought it would be good to wright about something like this.	13678	
10679	4	"The author ends this way to show the readers that Saeng is determined to pass her driving test no matter how long it takes.She shows Saeng’s  determiniation to pass the test and how bad she really wants it.she is going to wait until the geese come back and the hibiscus blooms because she wants to start fresh. Also, Saeng is homesick and she misses her country so badly which is why she idolizes the plant and the geese; because they remind her of her own country. Saeng’s mother is a little annoyed at the fact that Saeng bought the artificial plant for @NUM1 since they grow freely at home. After her mother analyzes the situation, she sees that Saeng is homesick and depressed because she failed the driving test. Saeng is depressed, and the last paragraph shows it.   "	13679	
10680	4	"Relaxed, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First is relaxed because she is in her garden with her flowers which she loves to be around and they also make her feel back at home. Second is that she is @CAPS1 in wanting to go back but she cant at the moment. So she is using her gardening as a time passer. So she has to wait till next year. And finally it is @CAPS2 when she is around her plants she feels no pain, no pressure of any kind its when she -relaxes her mind and body. She always helps her mom garden so thats how she fell in love with all these different types of flowers.   "	13680	
10681	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng  had failed a test and at the end, she vows to take it again. She bought the flower after she failed the diver’s test because it reminded her of home. “ One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light srands of her grandmother`s long gray hair.” The plant had helped remind Saeng of her old country and it comforted her after she failed her test. After seeing the geese flying, she promises to take her driver’s test again when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding in the spring."	13681	
10682	4	To get the last meaning of the story and mabay at the end of the story that could be the most important part that why the author had a parghraph to end the story.	13682	
10683	4	"The author concludes the story like this for many reasons. First Saeng is walking home from failing her drivers test in the beginning of the story when she sees the hibiscus. She wants the circumstances to be the same next time she takes the test. They will be the same in the spring. Next she wants the hibiscus plant to bud before the next time she takes the test so it will comfort her and remind her of Vietnam, The hibiscus will make her less nervous about the test. Last the geese being back will remind her of that day she found the hibiscus plant. The author concludes the story well in saying when Saeng will take the test again when she has the hibiscus to comfort her."	13683	
10684	4	"The author ends the story with, “when they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" to symbolize a new beginning. People usually compare spring to a new beginning because all the plants come back to life and everything is green an lively again. The author wanted to show a sign of rebirth ar a new beginning because Saeng was willing to start over and try to take the test again"	13684	
10685	4	The author concludes on this sentence to give hope to all. But mainly to make the reader think of what is to come next. They tell of hope and adapting to the surroundings just like the flower blooms the cheter must adapt to surroundings and bloom too. The reason the author stoped on this particar sentece is because it @CAPS1 hope for the future and almost promises it that is why I @CAPS2 the author stoped on this particar @CAPS3.   	13685	
10686	4	I think that theauthor concludes the story with this is because she really wanted to pass this test and because her family was very important to her.	13686	
10687	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has more faith in yourself that she will pass the test when she goes back and takes it again because the hibiscus is budding and that will bring her luck to pass the test. This is why the author concludes the story with this ending.  	13687	
10688	4	"The author includes ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", for many reasons she says this because she wants to show that she dedicated to her garden @CAPS1 saying that she will try harder to make sure her hibiscus suvive. You know this when she says “then I will take that test again""."	13688	
10689	4	"The author concluded the story with this quote in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because I think she was suppose to use the money her mom gave her to go out to eat but instead decided to use it on a winter hibiscus to remind of her home land, so she believes using the money in the way it was intended was a test from her mother, and maybe next time when the plants survived through the harsh winter now that she has a memory of home she will suceed in passing the test."	13689	
10690	4	"The author concludes the story with paragraph because in the begin it said that Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam to the united states. She was going to take drivers test but didn’t do good. So maybe she can go again in pass if she study. So at the end she said so no one can here her in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This is why she said this and hope that she pastes."	13690	
10691	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng's story ends with a vow to take the test again because it shows a change that perpetuates the story's theme of never giving up and overcoming obstacles. When Saeng initially fails her drivers test, she buys the “Winter hibiscus, the plant is a symbol for Saeng. When the plant blooms in the @DATE1, Saeng will also “bloom,” and pass her test. In this way, the author ends the story with the vow to reflect the theme and symbolism in the story."	13691	
10692	4	"The author ends the story in this way because she uses it as a sort of hidden meaning. When she says she will take the test again, she means she wants to try again, start over. When the geese return, which she also says, means they are coming back to start over. Finally, she says; “ and this hibiscus is budding.” That too means the flower is starting over, sort of like a new life. All these stood for her life, how she had to start over in her new home. It was like beginning a whole new life  filled with hard times and struggles that must be overcome."	13692	
10693	4	"That maybe Saeng is most powerful in the spring when she is in school she can look outside and see that it’s all flower blooming colors everywhere. During the test all she could think about was the hibiscus plant. There her favorite plants, they used to have them at her old house around the lake."	13693	
10694	4	The author includes this line in the story because in the winter you can’t really do anything. When it’s spring you do a whole lot.	13694	
10695	4	"After reading the story,the author concludes it with a very specific paragraph. The author concludes it that way because it will be her time. By that I mean everything will be going back and starting over and trying again. Then  the flower will get it reality back and give her luck. So the flower goes luck and its means it’s time  to  start again  and  you  will  be  successful   this time around that is why the author ends the story with  such great details in one small paragraph, about the buds and the flower coming back in the Saeng."	13695	
10696	4	" She is not give up hope to pass that test “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding then I will take that test again. A failed is never failed until they have given up on what the did not pass. “I-I failed the test."" Beautiful thing can make you feel better when you are down. ""It’s a beautiful plant."" @CAPS1 is not the end of the world unless you never learn from the @CAPS1 of what you do or you never try to notice so that it will not happen to you again. Just like the old people say you never learn if you away win everything you do in your life."""	13696	
10697	4	"The author concludes the story with stateing when the hibiscus bud and the geese come back after the snow melt she would take the test again.She say this because the hibiscus give her a since of hope, and remind her of her home town. “The rich sweet sent it was familiar to. “It, is not the prettiest but in the harsh winds it still has what it needs to survive.” In conclusion she is exspired by the plant. "	13697	
10698	4	"Saeng is a young girl and has a lot of things on her mind other than this so called “test"". She is determined to accomplish her goals and feels down when they are not compleleted. She lives in a life of poverby from what it sounds like and her mother is very supportive. It sounds like an ok life and a great family. The hibiscus in the story enabled Saeng to channel her sorrow for failing the test. The plant reminds her of her homeland in Vietnam reason here; “And that rich, sweet scent-that was familiar too.” This shows how when she is in the flower shop she is being reminded of her home land. But I bealive that the author concludes the story with this because Saeng is wishing that she could pass the test and it is not only giving us hopes but it gives her hope also. This is making up for the times that she felt down, “ And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is so sad and when she is seeing the plants of her home land it makes. her even more sad. The author used geese at the end to force Saeng to have to use that time to retake the test. Next time that year at spring Saeng will go retake the test. The author was very thoughtful when she used this quote. She placed it as a hope and marker in Saeng’s life. It gave the reader and character hope and sealed the end of the writing.  "	13698	
10699	4	"The author ends the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng has started to adapt to her new world and will and strive to live happily in @LOCATION1. She is using the winter hibiscus as a sign of motivation. She says at the flower shop that the hisbiscus reminds her of her home and of the beautiful flowers that grew in Vietnam. Saeng wants to fit in and impress her mother by passing the driving test, and will not stop trying until she suceeds. Saeng is very homesick, but the hisbiscus helps her to feel more at home and comfortable in her new environment. The author ends the story with the last paragraph to show that Saeng will never give up, and never stop trying."	13699	
10700	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is trying to show Saeng’s determination to be less emotional of not being in her homeland. Perhaps the author meant for two meanings of her using the word test. Maybe her class at school had a test and ignorance of the English language made her realize she doesn’t belong. It @MONTH1 also be her test of strength in letting go. Either way, Saeng’s determination to let go het past is what matters most to her and this is why the author points this out."	13700	
10701	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author conclude with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because the author is saying that you shouldn't give up, things will get better. The author had to move, so she bought a plant that help her remember her past, ""back home."" So in doing that concluding with that statement she is saying that after all she keep remembering."	13701	
10702	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it basically ties everything together. The places paragraph is explaining how Saeng refuses to give up and keep trying. This paragraph also presents the hard things she has to overcome and how Saeng will not give up. In a way the spring represents a new beginning and a new way at looking a thing. A way to learn, except and move on. Lastly, the paragraph saw Saeng determination by how she says, “then I will take that test again.” Saeng is a fighter."	13702	
10703	4	"‘’When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again’’ The author concludes the story with this sentence to really show the readers how much hope this hibiscus plant is giving this girl. She also said this to show the readers that this girl was not going to giving up on the test. The author is sending out a message that you should  never give up."	13703	
10704	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for a couple of reasons. First I think she chose it because it brings you back to the main point of the story. The paragraph also wraps everything and all the I deas up into one section or piece wich helps the reader understand the meaning of the story better. It also shows that the Author has compassion in her writing.	13704	
10705	4	The auther ended the story with this text because it shows that she is going to keep on trying in life and not give up that is why I think the Author put this text at the end of the text	13705	
10706	4	"The author Minfong Ho concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph for a very good reason. This reason is because that sums up what “Winter Hibiscus” was all about. So when Minfong Ho wrote that paragraph, he knew that the hibiscus plants reminded Saeng of Vietnam, where she used to live before she moved to the United States. In conclusion, this is why Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph.  "	13706	
10707	4	"The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because Saeng took a drivers test and failed it. She is saying, that she will wait till the spring, to recover from failing and try again fresh in the springtime. Spring is the beginning of new life and regrowth, so she will have a fresh start to take the test again in spring."	13707	
10708	4	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph because they explain one another to be specific, the story explains why stated in the last paragraph, saeng will take her test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This last paragraph expresses how the geese and hibiscus has an effect on her confidence level. She thinks she will do good the next time she takes the test so she will do good and pass."	13708	
10709	4	She concludes the story on that note with that sentence to show that Saeng wont give up on that test. She will just do the test at a later time when the flower is blooming and she’ll be more prepared.	13709	
10710	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to know that Saeng is learning to adapt. For example, whene it says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon seasn, almost familiar of now.” It says how all that time she thought everything was different, it came out not to be. After that, she realizes that if the hibiscus plant can make it through the winter, then so can she and she can take her test in the spring."	13710	
10711	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they have atest to try at these plants I dont understand this story ol	13711	
10712	4	"The last paragraph of the story is very strong. It shows meaning and appreciation. Without it, the winter hibiscus would not portray as much. The winter hibiscus is a sign of Saeng’s homeland. It reminds her of many memories, and also gives her strength. Thinking of her homeland makes her “break down and weep” but it also gives her the drive to push forward. She spent over nineteen dollars on the plant so her and her mother could plant it in their own garden. Being reminded of her homeland makes Saeng realize that things do change and she has to learn to adapt. The hibiscus tree represents the grow Saeng will go through. As it starts to grow and bloom, Saeng will adjust and appreciate what she has, and eventually she will have enough strength to take the test again. This last paragraph shows readers how much the winter hibiscus means to Saeng, how it gives her courage and strength to push through the hard times.  "	13712	
10713	4	"The Author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she isn’t going to give up. She is going to try again when she gets the chance. Also as the time goes by, she can improve and get stronger in whatever she needs to."	13713	
10714	4	"The author uses this to end the story because , she loves spring she wants the flowers to bud so the can bloom beautiful."	13714	
10715	4	"The author concludes the story this way to show how Saeng matured after planting the flower. The one way was be having her start trying when telling her mother about the flowr.’’ she burst into tears’’. This showed how she missed her old place she lived and how she was not sure of her new home. Then after she planted the flower she relized. She was different and said. ""She had discovered none of her class mates or friends not even @PERSON1 liked it’’. This showed how she came to adcept that she was different and haw she had matured in one day.         "	13715	
10716	4	"The author concludes the story with this because he wants his readers to know how they felt during the writer time when the snow melts, and they said they’ll take their test."	13716	
10717	4	The author was trying to send out message that even though you fail at something you can always start over. When winter came and the flowers were gone they will come back once the snow is gone and spring emerges. The flowers have a certain simalarity with not just Saeng but with everyone that doesn’t bloom so much at first.	13717	
10718	4	"Minfong Ho ended his story, “winter hibiscus,” by writing, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” By doing this, Ho makes a connection between Saeng and the hibiscus. The budding of the hibiscus represents starting over and trying again. Ho connects Saeng to the hibiscus a couple of times in this story. When Saeng brings it back and says that it is not like the ones at her home, it represents her leaving home and becoming a different person. Also, the way the hibiscus lives through the winter represents Saeng making it through the harsh times. By connecting these two characters, Minfong Ho makes the story more heartfelt and well written."	13718	
10719	4	"In the story ""winter Hibiscus"", the hibiscus plant represents Saeng's past life in Vietnam. “Plants” that she had not even realized she had known but had Forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. ""@CAPS1 this plant is a piece of her old home, Saeng takes it with her to the end of the story. In the last paragraph she uses the hibiscus plant she just planted as away to move into her future. ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" Saeng uses this plant from her past as inspiration to achieve her goal in the future. Although Saeng failed her drivers test on her first try, her plant and piece of home encourages her not to give upon her goals in her new home. when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, not only will her old home become almost reborn in her new home but Saeng will take the test for her driver's license again. Finally, Saeng will move from her past into her future as her new surrounds become ""almost familiar to her now."""	13719	
10720	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng pation for gardening. This paragraph shows that she can’t wait until next year when she is able to grow again. When she said she was going to take the test again that means that she is going to make her garden better next time when spring comes and all the snow melts and the geese return. So the author put this paragraph in the story to show that Saeng really loves to do this.	13720	
10721	4	"The story “winter Hibiscus”  by  Minfong   Ho  a mother  and daughter  talk  about  the  flower  the  @ORGANIZATION1  to  finish  off   the  story  she  quotes  “when  they  come  back,  Saeng  vowed  silently  to   herself  in  the  spring  , when  the  snows   melt  and   the  geese  return   and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  then  I will wait  until winter  is  over  to  harvest  the hibiscus again. I  show  that  every  year  saeng  goes  out  to  harvest  this flower  every   year  on- end"	13721	
10722	4	"The purpose of the paragraph is to inform the readers about saeng’s next move. Saeng said “when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agaen.” Instead of ending the story on a sad note, the author concludes the story with a paragraph to show how saeng is adapting to life in the United states. The view of geese and hibiscus give her the strength and courage to retake the test over again and perform even better. The author did not include the paragraph to make the story longer but instead to demonstrate how saeng is influence by the hibiscus and the geese."	13722	
10723	4	"The author concludes the story with this  sentence because  it  leaves  the  reader  waiting  and  wondering .She says that she will “ take that test again ,” and it leaves the leader  waiting to see if she passes  the  test  then . The author of  the story  ended  it  with a  sentence saying that she will try something again  . It doesn’t  say  what  happen s  when  she  tries and it  doesn’t  say even  what test she is referring to . It just  says that she ‘ll  try  it  again, which leaves  the reader with questions . This is why  the author ended  her  story  with  this  sentence"	13723	
10724	4	What she is trying to say is that maybe when spring come’s she might tack the test again. Maybe whe the geese return and this hibiscus is budding she will take the tests again. But not right now.	13724	
10725	4	"I would say this is a really good ending for this passage. I would say so because, she is showing respect for herself by not giving up all hope, & the hibiscus has something to do with it."	13725	
10726	4	"The author concludes the story because, he wanted to get the meaning of the story and try to get you to see the real meaning of this story and how to comprehen what it is saying, the mood of the story has to stay focused and do things the right way"	13726	
10727	4	The last paragraph of the story shows that saeng will not take her driving test again until the hibiscus comes out next spring. The reason I think Saeng is waiting to take her test again when the flowers bloom because it will give her a sort of inspiration to pass her test. I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will always be thinking about her real home and if she passes the test then that will have even more meaning when she passes her driving test.  	13727	
10728	4	Saeng ends her story in this fashion to end the story on a positive  note. To leave the readers with a good taste in their mouths. It was nessacary because the story is a sad story. It is about a girl failing her task and not reaching her goal. The author ends in this was to give the character a little hope and to pick up the story a little bit. That is why the author ended the story the way that he/she did.	13728	
10729	4	The author concludes the paragraph like that because the birds were migrating and hes talking about them coming back.	13729	
10730	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she knows that everything can be right again. Even though she lost her childhood and the place where. she grew up, she is willing to start over. She’s saying that once the hibiscus is budding and the geese return, she can start over. She is willing to start a new life in her new world. The whole story is talking about how upset she is about being in a new country, missing her grandmother, and missing everything else about her childhood. When she sees the plant from her childhood country, it brings comfort to see something that means something to her. She gets upset though because she sees how out of place she is in this new country and how she wishes she were in her childhood again. When she gets home and shows the plant to her mother, she realizes that things in this new country have also become familiar to her. She knows that this is where she lives now and she can set things right in this new, Familiar country. She’s saying that once she is fully ready and understands her new home, she’ll be ready to take the driving test and start a new life."	13730	
10731	4	The author ended the story like this because it shows the determination of Saeng to complete until she passes it. I also believe the author concluded the story like this is because. it is to be believed that if hibiscus is budding again and the snow melts that she will do great on her test. The hibiscus is almost like her good luck charm without the hibscus she feels she will fail the test. Because it is some what like a piece of home to her.  	13731	
10732	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One reason is that the test means so much to Saeng in so many different ways. It represents how hard it is for her to adjust to the new life. It also represents how much she wants to pass the test just to prove that she isn’t having a hard time with her life. Another reason is that the author wants the reader to know the Saeng isn’t going to give up. The author wants to show readers to never give up to matter how hard and hopeless it seems. Saeng is having a terrible time in her life and he still won’t give up.	13732	
10733	4	"The author ends the story with the narrators though “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. “to emphasize the theme of the passage . To be specific, the authors theme was survival and adapting to new surrounding, by ending with the narrator vowing to try again in the spring It shows the narrators will to survive in a new area/home. The author @MONTH1 have also ended this way for symbolic purposes. Forexample, having the girl promise to try the test again “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is bidding “ has the hibiscus symbolizing not only the literal sense of beauty but the idea of cormfort, strength, determination and survival. The author also has the change of season from winter to spring symbolizing not just the change of time but also as symbolic for the author’s ability to adapt to her new surrounding/home because her family has moved to the @CAPS1 from Vietnam and she is missing home very much. Fastly, the author could have ended the story like this to create a final mood, @ORGANIZATION1, when one reads the final sentence they get the feeling of determination, power, strength, drive etc. therefore the after effect or feelings they have are strong and fresh causing it easier for the reader to understand the theme and symbolism in the story “Winter Hibiscus”"	13733	
10734	4	The author ends the story saying Saeng will take the test again once the hibiscus is budding. This is because he was trying to appreciate the changes of life. He was watching over the plant to see how the hibiscus flower appreciates the changes in it’s life.	13734	
10735	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it means that when the snows melt they will go back to gardening. maybe they are gonna plant the same thing because the other plant die. It could probaly be that because the paragraph says “I will take that test again""."	13735	
10736	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng vowed silently to herself ,”in the spring  when the  snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buildind, then i will take that test again, ""which mean in the spring  Saeng  is going to get to start over and hope things will turn out better this time for her. And star all over, and the snow melting represents the bad leaving  Saeng and spring bring her a new start"	13736	
10737	4	"The author chose to end the story like he or she did because it signifies that she will change just like the hibiscus, the geese, and the snow. The snow will melt away, The geese will change course, and the hibiscus will be budding. All of the things that she notices in @LOCATION1 will change and so will she in @LOCATION1. She will change and pass the test."	13737	
10738	4	"The author concludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it shows hope for Saeng's future. The geese had become familiar, and Saeng had been looking for comfort in her memories. The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story because it links everything togeher."	13738	
10739	4	The Author finishes this story like that because she wants to do this test over and if she does it in the winter the the plant will be back and she will think of home again.	13739	
10740	4	"The author chose this as the last paragraph because it wraps up what happened in the story. Every thing in the story that is mentioned about he surroundings is said in this sentence. The geese leaving the snow, and the hibiscus she planted. Since she failed the test the first time maybe when the season changes she will be able to do better. This is a good coming up of the story. This is why the author put this at the end."	13740	
10741	4	"The author concluded the story with that paragraph to have a happy ending with a simple message. The author ended that way because it showed that even though saeng was very unhappy that she would try in life to succeed and be happy. In the last paragraph It said that Saeng would take the driver’s test again once the “hibiscus is budding “ during spring time. I think that symbolized that when spring comes around she will have a fresh new start. The hibiscus budding also symbolizes the fresh start of it to grow a flower and become beautiful. So Saeng will see how the spring brings a new start for the plants blossoming, so she will have fresh start at getting her license. The last paragraph is very happy with in symbolic meaning to it, so that’s why the author concludes with it."	13741	
10742	4	"The author concludes this story with that sentence to show that she is confindend and ambisous. She shows this by not quiting after she already to her test. That says that shes growing and learning to understand life, never quit try harder. The flower in the story represents life and she has to over come her obstacles which is to pass that test. This is why the author concludes this story with that paragraph."	13742	
10743	4	"The reason why the author added the last paragraph was because saeng feels that she has failed her mother. For example, when Saeng says “I-I failed the test.” That is proof that she feels like a failure because she bought the Dok faeng-noi for @MONEY1. The reason why she feels like a failure is because they were not real and were very expensive. Even though her mother forgives her, she still wants to make things right the next time she gets a chance."	13743	
10744	4	I think she ended the story like this because the flower mean’s somthing to her. It is special to Saeng.	13744	
10745	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show how Saeng wants to start fresh and to show how Saeng has learned  to deal with different environments.She has  moved  here from Vietnam during the winter which is the harshes season to live through in the @LOCATION2She  figures  that maybe she can get better start than she had before.She now is aware that Vietnam is gone and she must start over.	13745	
10746	4	"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, maybe Saeng taken the hibicus as a goodluck and when it blossoms beautifully in the spring and that she my nt have high hopes of passing the test. She misses her hometown that’s why she will wait till spring for the hibiscus to blossoms. She also love thos hibiscus that she perecious them."	13746	
10747	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with those words because it is saying that whe Saeng feels ready and not discouraged anymore then she will take the test another time. She will be happy and ready for the test. The author also probably concluded the story with that paragraph because that is how everything else is started no matter what it is.	13747	
10748	4	"The author, Minfong Ho ended the story with this paragraph because it shows the change of mood of Saeng. The author also ended with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is now confident, and she is ready “take that test again”. Another reason why the author ended the story that way is because she @MONTH1 of built suspense for what is going to happen next. Also the author @MONTH1 have even wanted the reader to fill in the rest of the story themselfes, about what happens when the geese come back. Lastly I think that it was just a motivational happy ending to just keep looking forward. "	13748	
10749	4	"The conclusion of “Winter Hibiscus” is placed so that it leaves the reader with a sense of hope. As the story gradually becomes more and more downcast as it moves along, this paragraph reverses that motion. The reader feels optimistic about Saeng’s future and their own, invoking a cathartic effect. The downcast elements such as the memory in the flower shop and the knowledge that Saeng failed the test are countered with this simple wish of hope."	13749	
10750	4	Because she is willing to give this place a chance come spring. Posabliy meaning it could be easy because she’ll have a home town flower that could make her better. The flowers make her feel comfortable and at home. So she’ll give it another chance next spring.	13750	
10751	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it coveys the message, that you should never give up. Saeng knows that she will do better when the hibiscus is budding, for example, the author states “hibiscus is budding, then will take the test.” this quote is important to the story because it shows that she won’t give up, and she knows that she will do better when the hibiscus is budding, because it will remind her of her homeland, and that will give her the courage to do better on the test. Thats why the author concludes this story with that paragraph."	13751	
10752	4	The author ended the story like that because it demon strokes how the flower gave Saeng the courage to take the test again and most likely pass it. She will bloom in the spring just like th hibiscus.  	13752	
10753	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows Saeng’s determination. Saeng is trying to adapt to her new surroundings and still has memories about her homeland and the wildlife that was there. She misses it very dearly. Also, it shows how much her homeland ment to her and how the plant affects her. Saeng doesn’t want to leave her memories of her homeland behind because they comfort her"	13753	
10754	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows the theme, the symbolism of the plant and saeng’s life. The author made this as the conclusion because it shows how saeng wouldn’t be brought down by  a failure, she will be determined and work towards her goal of passsing her driving test. This paragraph also ends the story with a possitive note as well as show that with a new day there is a  fresh start. The hibiscus symbolizes saeng’s life in  how she will pull through the tough times and push foreward through her problems; like the plant blooms after a harsh winter so shall saeng bloom and succeed at her goals to pass her drivers test. The paragraph sums up the whole point of purpose of the story. This is the most likely cause for author to end the story with this paragraph."	13754	
10755	4	"I think the @CAPS1 concluded this paragraph this was because it shows everything that Saeng went through and it makes her seem like she has some type of determination or desire to try again. At first the Author made her look like a quiter and was careless about her action. It seem liked all she knew who to do was feel sorry for her life.  She did not relize that somtimes you get @CAPS2 chances and your Not always out of luck. The @CAPS3 was very smart to this And I think it was a very good way to end the story. It also rapes up the story bcacase when it told us about Saeng failing that driver test it never gave us a conclusin about wether she was going to take it again and if so when. ""@CAPS4 vowed silently to herself,"" that shows that she might be serious about and really want to past the test."	13755	
10756	4	He does this to show the reader a metaphoracal way of seeing things.	13756	
10757	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she want’s to show the determination	13757	
10758	4	The author is saying that until the spring when the birds retern and the flower bud then bloom she will take the test again. she wants te wait to take the test.	13758	
10759	4	"The authoR concluded the stoRy with that paRagRaph because it mainly @CAPS1 the stoRy up and is the whole @CAPS2 Why Saeng bought the plant. In the stoRy Saeng failed heR dRiving test and befoRe she came home she bought a plant that she saw foR the fiRSt time in a pot, because back at home in Vietnam they gRew out in the wild and you couldn’t just buy them in a pot. The last paRagRaph is mainly @CAPS3 to the fact that she will go back to take heR test once the plant blossoms again, then she will be @CAPS4. The plant @CAPS5 Saeng gRowing and becoming moRe pRepaRed for the dRiving test.     "	13759	
10760	4	The author said that because this girl and her friend did something to her mothers garden. I have no idea what test they are talking about.	13760	
10761	4	"The author ended the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is it is a good style of writing, to end where you began. Also in the story it puts forth hope and spirit. To end where you began is good style of writing. For example, in @ORGANIZATION1’s and @ORGANIZATION2's you write an opening and closing where you state and then restate your points. Also, it ends on a good note, by putting forth hope and spirit. This is because in the beginning she fail which brought down the mood of most of the story and at the last second this shoots the mood right back up to the top. This is why the author ended the story with this paragraph."	13761	
10762	4	"Saeng was meaning that she wont take the test again. Because she didn’t like it, it was to hard. And it was stressing her out. So the was her last time that she will ever try to take the test. And she cant like it here anyway she wants to move back where she was at first. Because she had friends and her schooling was different back where she was at."	13762	
10763	4	"The author used this as the ending paragraph because he/she wanted to show this is the end of something for sompeople, but also a beginning for someone else. Saeng is adjusting and she uses plants to help her. So the plant maybe gone for now but when it returns in the spring it will be a beginning for Saeng to be comfortable and she would be well adjusted by then it will help her face another emotion she is feeling."	13763	
10764	4	The  author  concludes  the  start  with  this  paragraph because  Saeng  failed the  first  test .  The  paragraph says that   when  the  snow melts  and  the  geese  return  and  that  Saeng  hibiscus  is  budding  then  Saeng  will  take  that  test  again . It  is  a  test on  the  hibiscus  because  it  starts  budding   after  the  winter.	13764	
10765	4	"The author concludes th story with this paragraph to show how much they love their p ordon. This paragraph is saying thot when it is planting season and the garden is growing she will take the test of heeping the flowers alive once again. They show this is the story when she says  “Instead, she stored at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf and tore it to sireds.” This is how disappointed they get whe the plont died so thats wh they endod it like that."	13765	
10766	4	"The concludes this story with Saeng making it vowed to show she is determind, and you can adapt to a new life. Saeng is depressed in the begin because she failed the test. She is having problems adapting to her new home. The paragraph at the end show her determination to not give up. She says, ""...I will take the test again.” She shows she won’t give up on the test. She @MONTH1 have failed this time, but next time she will get; The also show she will keep keep try to adapt to her new life just as she is going to try the test again. She, also realize she can adapt to her new life just as the plant will. She begins to realize she is adapting in the paragraph before the last one. “She realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar.” The conclusion paragraph ends that way for those reason.   "	13766	
10767	4	"I think the main reason why the author added that sentence in the story is because he wanted to tell the audience that the character cared about the fllowers, and it still has hope for it, so the character is trying to say is that the experiment didn’t work this time but hopefully it will work next time, that is what it is trying to say, and that is why I think he/she added that sentence."	13767	
10768	4	The author included the vow in the story to show that each season brings a now chance. Also a fresh start. Also that start is happy its warm and funny and the beginning of somethings and also a clean state to try and drive again. The hibiscus as beautiful and the buds will show a near beginning for the plant.	13768	
10769	4	"The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng’s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1."	13769	
10770	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to try and show how much the plant means to her and how she can’t wait until it buds again. The author was trying to get the point that Saeng gets sad when winter comes around because he flower dies off. Saeng will only take the test again if the flowers starts to bud again.	13770	
10771	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character, Saeng vowed that, “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” The author concludes the story with that sentence because through she still believes that she can take the test again. After Saeng fails the driving test she see’s a  winter  hibiscus flower which is a metaphor. Saeng thinks, “How strange to see it in a pot.” @CAPS1 that she is still used to Vietnam where they grow naturally in the wild, Saeng doesn’t have her liciense which makes her feel trapped in a pot. Also in a spring when the, “hibiscus is budding,” and is something completely different in the winter, is when Saeng will pass the test, because just like the hibiscus, she will be something different as well."	13771	
10772	4	"The author ends the story with the paragraph to show what she has learned. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author goes to buy a flower and is overwhelmed with memories of her home and grandmother, which she misses. In the end she talks to her mother and thinks to herself “… In the spring,when the snow melts and the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(Minfong Ho). She ends the story this way to show that if the world arround her can adjust to it's surrounding so can she, so she says when the winters over she will make up the test she failed. The point of ending the story this way is to show how she can overcome her home sickness."	13772	
10773	4	It’s a good way to end it.	13773	
10774	4	I think the author concludes this story with this paragraph. Because it shows to keeps trying and never give up at your goals.     	13774	
10775	4	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph so we can know what she plans to do. She also concludes the story like that to show she will not give up that she will try again for her hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her old home. So she is really doing this for her old home.	13775	
10776	4	"I believe that the author uses this last sentence to set the theme of the story. He first has her mourning her homeland and then ends it with a new beginning. He also shows that she is able to accept change now, because as all of these events over she vowes to retake the test with a will to pass it. The reason why I believe it was important to end it like this is because the stresses her sadness and emotion with the vivid memories of her past and then finishes with a complete turnaround one a charge of heart. I think the will to suceed was very important and this ending gave a lot to the overall theme."	13776	
10777	4	"After reading “Winter Hibiscus” I think that the author concludes the story saying that she will retake her driving test in the spring, to show how her confidence and persevence could be rekindled by a simple reminder of home. The author ended the story like this to show readers that when you feel discouraged, to deep faith in yourself and your actions. When Saeng failed her driving test she was greatly discouraged about herself and her life in @LOCATION1. When she later went into the greenery and found all of the plants from Vietnam she remembered herself. She found the courage and lost confidence to try better next time and to give herself a chance to adjust to @LOCATION1 and her new home."	13777	
10778	4	"I think that author uses that line to show a connection with Saeng and her love for plants. Basically what Saeng is promising herself is when garden season comes back she will take the test again because it’s a whole new year and sheis going to bloom again just like her flower, but this time she will be successful. To me it kind of seems like she is her garden because she wont do anything till it’s warm and her plants and vegetable garden grows again. "	13778	
10779	4	The author ended the story with these two lines because there are some test that you can only take  in the spring which in this case it one of them test	13779	
10780	4	"The author ends the story like this because that is where saeng is most comfortable and relaxed. The author wanted to end the story where she started it at seang’s home to show how much she enjoyed the adventure, but in the end she would want to be at home where she loves it. The author said, “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” which is what makes her feel and know that she is home she ends the story by saying, ”Then I will take the test again,” she ended it all by saying that because even though she loves being at her home the adventure was fun and eventually she will do it all again."	13780	
10781	4	"The author ends the story by @CAPS1 “when they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again”. Saeng had just failed her driver’s test and on the way home bought a hibiscus. She took it home and showed her mother and planted it. The story ends with Saeng @CAPS1 she will take the test again when the hibiscus blooms to show the new beginning the hibiscus symbolizes. The story quotes, “and when the sun had dries it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok malik bud into it. Saeng is remembering her life in Vietnam and how she helped her grandmother and put flowers in her hair. The hibiscus is a memory of the past and encourages Saeng to approach the future successfully. The hibiscus is a sense of new beginning for Saeng with support from the past. The plant gives hope to Saeng and courage since it reminds her of her mother country. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with @CAPS1 saeng will take the test when the hibiscus blooms to show the new courage saeng finds in her new country with memories of her past such as plants like the hibiscus. The hibiscus blooming will be the sign of a new beginning for saeng with support and memory from her past."	13781	
10782	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is because the paragraph displays Saeng’s determination for completing her “test”. She didn’t achieve the test the first time and didn’t want. to fail again so the final paragraph explains “in the spring,... then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1, the author concludes the story with the final paragraph to display Saeng’s determination."	13782	
10783	4	Saeng includes that last paragraph as a concliuding factor & to bring the story to a close. All stories end in some tashion & Saeng slow brought tha story to a close in that manor. Sometimes conclusions do incldle explanation or insigt to the rest of the characters like as previous parts of charactors like in the conclusion she “vowed silently“ is the way of providing insight to a future part of the story & to explain what it meant to Saeng & to show more about @CAPS1 feeling towards the plant & to show most of determination & perserverance.	13783	
10784	4	The author used this sensents. To tell us what she is going to do next. That is why he used it. Because he wants us to know is going on. And what she is doing. that is why.	13784	
10785	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows hope for the character Saeng. This paragraph represents hope because it includes “snow melting and the geese return” as a metaphor for the hard times being even as winter, and the geese returning as a metaphor for remourse. The last paragraph also states “and this hibiscus is budding” which can be seen as a metaphor for Saeng who is represented by the plant in a this can be seen throughout the story as the different plants bring memories to the character, and one relates to them in a that they come from the same home. By the character announcing that the plant will bud, it relates back to Saeng growing and being able to pass the test."	13785	
10786	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, she realizes now that you have time to try things again. For example, when she takes the test next time, she will overcome any fears and be determined to pass the test.The hibiscus is a symbol of beauty in an odd place, just like Saeng."	13786	
10787	4	"When they come back in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She concludes the story with this paragraph because she means the spring is the start of new beginings and then she will be ready to take that test"	13787	
10788	4	I think the author ends this short story with this paragraph because with every cold bitter winter there is a buitiful @DATE1 and you can see the true buity in us all. But it could also mean that we get all sheltered in winter but in @DATE1 he let it all hang out.	13788	
10789	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show there is always a new chance and a new opportunity. What Minfong ho is doing is she’s comparing the garden to Saeng’s life. The author is saying when it snows the flowers and hibiscus will die. When the snow starts to melt the flowers will live again. So it’s a new year for Saeng and new opportunities and this year she will pass the test. Saeng said “Not like the kind we had at @NUM1) She is still trying to adapt to her new country and this year she will pass the test.	13789	
10790	4	"The author ends the story with the paragraph, ”when they come back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again “ , to let the reader decide the ending .  The story is unclear in saying what “test “she took and is going to take again in the spring, it is up to the reader to decide. This strategy used by the author can allow the reader to make the story more personal and beter relate it to themsel f.  The reader could relate something in their life to what “test “she will take and this could let the story be interperated by diferent    readers in different ways. The author had a unique approach to how he ended the story.   "	13790	
10791	4	"The author includes the part about taking the driving test again in spring. This is done to show that the discovery of the hibiscus was because of the frustration of failing the drivers test, ‘’as Saeng walks home after failing her drivers test, she sees a familiar plant.’’ The last paragraph is also included to show the comfort that the familiar plant provides for her,’’ It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of relent toward the center just as she had known it would feel.’’ The hibiscus would give Saeng the confidence to pass the test. And, with the blooming of the hibiscus Saeng would too bloom, and pass the test.            "	13791	
10792	4	The author concludes with his paragraph so that his writing would make more since. While that is being said it means that there stating to appreciate more things and now appreciating more of the nature and animals.	13792	
10793	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because eventually Saeng , the protagonist, learns from the spirit of hibiscus and believes in herself again. Saeng’s mother praises hibiscus by saying ,”Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” What we see with our eyes is not everything. Although the flower of hibiscus is not as appealing, it undergoes the cruel weather. Also, Saeng  thinks,” Back home it just grew wild, jutting tiled roofs.” The hibiscus not only reminds her that she will overcome obstacles as long as she perseveres but also arouses her memories back home. It is inevitable that  new immigrants feel lonesome and get homesick. The hibiscus, commonly found in Vietnam, comforts Saeng. As she thinks about Vietnam, she has the energy to go through the challenges, including the driver’s test."	13793	
10794	4	"The author uses that paragraph at the end of the story to show that Saeng is going to retry to adapt to her new life, just like the hibiscus has to. The hibiscus is symbolizing Saeng and her way of adapting the new environment. I know this because in the story the author talks about how the hibiscus has to adapt to change and survive wherever it is planted, just like Saeng. She has to adapt to where ever she @MONTH1 live. The paragraph also leaves the reader wandering if she will pass the “test” or not. It was a great technique used by the author."	13794	
10795	4	"Saeng vowed silently to herself, “ In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’’ Saeng is comforted by the memories of her homeland and this plant reminds her of her home. This plant gave her hope and signified that things will get better. As a reader, you feel bad for Saeng coming into a country that is not easy to get by in and is @PERCENT1 different than her life in Vietnam. The only thing that reminded her of home was this plant and it made her sad but also gave her strength and hope that there are better things to come and she will get through it."	13795	
10796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is very difficult to drive in snow. In spring the streets are mess up with snow and road become sleepry. If you drive in this sitution and you are new driver then it might accident with you. so you should be very careful to drive in snow. When snow melt after that you can learn and take the test again. Then this would be better for you to take a test.	13796	
10797	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she will happen all the time.	13797	
10798	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus will be budding, and the geese will return in the spring, so the hibiscus bring saeng back to her childhood and country it will bring joy and comfort so it will give her strenth and hope to retake the test she fail. That’s why she will wait till spring."	13798	
10799	4	Saeng was still getting used to @LOCATION1 in the story Winter Hibiscus. She just failed her driver’s test and saw a plant that she knew in Vietnam. Seeing the plant made her think of Vietnam and due to that Saeng got emotional. Saeng was also getting used to the @CAPS1 food. She was supposed to be getting Big-@CAPS2 with a boy but instead got a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because it pertains to the rest of the story. The last paragraph shows tha Saeng will be more adapted and used to the @CAPS1 culture when she next takes her drivers test.	13799	
10800	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to bring hope for the future. Saeng was not doing so good in her new country and she also failed the test. The paragraph brings hope that everything would be okay and she would past the test. This makes you believe that thing will go the way you will like in the future.	13800	
10801	4	"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho she concludes her story with a unique paragraph talking about when the spring comes, and the geese return she will take the test again. The reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph was to show that things don't end so suddenly and that a person can make a difference. In the short story Saeng fails a driving test and spends nineteen dollars on a hibiscus that she damage. But her mother plant the hibiscus to save it. Saeng realizes that although she failed the driving test the first time it is snot over for her, just like it isn't over for the hibiscus or the geese that leave or die in the winter because they come back. The hibiscus and the geese are a symbol for hope in the paragraph ,”when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding“ (Ho @NUM1), The quote shows hope for Saeng that things don't stop there that’s why  she conclude her story with the paragraph. That she will return to pass the driving test just like the hibiscus and geese.    "	13801	
10802	4	"The author chooses to end the story with the paragraph because it is a happy and hopeful ending. The main reason that Saeng is upset is because she failed the test. However, she is also upset that she isn’t in Vietnam anymore. It is also winter, which makes the setting seem as black as Saeng feels. The paragraph talks about spring coming again, which will melt away the black winter. The hibiscus will bloom, making Saeng’s surroundings more like home, and then when everything else is getting better she will try to pass the test again. She feels positive because she knows that everything bad will get better. Hope Is one effective way to end a story."	13802	
10803	4	"The author ends the story with with selection to snow she was determined to cross the test like the hibiscus will be able to survive in this new environment. She bought the plant to remind her of home where she dd not have to worry about the test. “....Saeng pickicked it up and smellseit. She closed her eyes and breathedin deeply. The samiliar or frangrene filled her lungs...” This shows the hibiscus was close to her heart at home. She bought it despite its price of @MONEY1.” Nothing else. I paid over @MONEY1 dollers for it. 'You what?' her mother stared at her incredulously.” This shows that the hibiscus was very important to her for the fact that she bought it even though it was so expensive. She believes the hibiscus is like her life, it will bloom in the new place, as will she. Thefore she says when the hibiscus blooms, she will take the test because it will be her time to bloom."	13803	
10804	4	"The conclusion to the story “Winter Hibiscus” signifies Saeng’s optimistic attitude toward adjusting to life in her new country. Saeng came from a country in which her, her mother, and her grandmother lived peacefully. Saeng describes the “saebba hedges” and the “dok malik” or hibiscus plants with the same longing tone, she uses to describe how she could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother long gray hair,…” The longing Saeng feels is what causes her to fail the “test”. She failed the test of being able to remember her home and not miss it so badly that she “broke down and wept”. When Saeng explains that she will take the test again “when the snows melt, and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding” she is talking about the spring. Spring is a symbol of new beginnings, and in a new beginning after the harsh winter, when the geese return and the hibiscus “blooms she will begin again with the spring. She will re-take the “test” and will try to pass the test of aceptance to her new life, and being over with the old life, as spring is over with winter.  "	13804	
10805	4	"The Author concluded the story with this pArAgrAph to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, motivAtion, And dEtErminAtion."	13805	
10806	4	"Many people have felt homesick, out of place, or have failed something. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” saeng goes through all of these feelings. She is homesick from Vietnam and is trying to adjust to life in  the @LOCATION2. In the beginning it describes how she failed her driving test, but on the way home she saw flowers that reminded her of home. At this point she is uppset and homesick. At the the end the author concludes the story with saeng saying that when the geese return, she will retake the driving test. Ithink the author did this to implly that saeng is determined and has hope in the future to pass the test, It shows she ids strong and it takes time to adapt, and succeed. For example, she feel s out of place and homesick at the beginning, but after talking to her mum she saw that good things can happen as long as she does not give up. The author also gave a positive outlook on the story which is another reason for concluding that way."	13806	
10807	4	They end the story like that because they want to keep the reader thinking. Thinking of what they just read but also what’s would happen next. So that person got it stuck in your mind. So then what the author was trying to get a crossed whatever the meaning @MONTH1 be. She got it to stick. That’s echually what she wanted to do. That’s how I no why she would end a story like that.	13807	
10808	4	"The conclusion to “Winter Hibiscus” is very clever. There are many reasons why the author chose that ending. First of all, you can tell that this story is about Saeng and what the flower represents to her. She sees a bit of determination in the flower. At the end, she is determined to take the test next year. This connection is deliberate on the part of the author. Another reason why this ending was chosen is that “the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, it will be spring. Spring is the time of her new beginnings and it fits well that Saeng should retake the test at this time. She is vowing to have a “new” chance in the “new” year. In winter, everything is dormant, including Saeng “determination”. When spring comes, “it will all come out. Ending with this paragraph also reflects on the changes in Saeng when she buys the flower. Drawing all these connections between the major ideas is a good way to end a story. The author chose a very good ending for “Winter Hibiscus”."	13808	
10809	4	"The author concludes the story like that because it shows it’s a @CAPS2 beginning. When she failed the drivers test she was devasted. When she saw the hibiscus it reminded her of her home. Saeng said, “There not like the ones back at home.” Then when she got home her mother was out gardening. When she told her how much it cost she was at a loss for words. Then when Saeng’s mother saw that she was crying @CAPS1 she felt bad. When her mother said lets plant this the hibiscus was dead or not blooming. When she looked up she saw geese flying away. Then she said, “when spring comes I will take that test again.” The hibiscus is symbolizing @CAPS2 chances, or @CAPS2 beginnings. Saeng said when the hibiscus gets another shot at life, she can get another chance to pass the drivers test. This is why I think the author finished at the story like that.     "	13809	
10810	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is determined to pass the test and things of home will help her. Saeng misses her home and can’t even get enough strength to say she misses it. I feel the reason why saeng failed her test was because she missed her home to much to concentrate. Saeng was very emotionally and attached to her home and feels she can’t do anything without it. That’s why the author concluded the story with that paragraph. The geese and the hibiscus remind saeng of Vietnam and will help her to suceed. She went into the plant store and bought the hibiscus to give her a more homely feeling so she can start to call @LOCATION2 her home. Once spring comes around saeng will have plenty of time to adjust to @LOCATION2. With the geese and the hibiscus around saeng will feel home and should be able to pass her test. The author is giving the reader the knowledge that when you have things that remind you of something you care about you will succeed. 	13810	
10811	4	"The author concludes they story with that paragraph because it is trying to explain that Saeng is going to come back with a whole new attitude and weather, and shes going to retake that test and pass it. And she is trying to say that the geese are good luck and when they come back, shes  gonna come back and pass that test. Also the winter hibiscus was in the ground and that good luck and a good sign to her. In closing thats why the author concluded that paragraph in this story."	13811	
10812	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng had failed the test before but wants to take it again to prove herself to her mother. She wants to prove to her mother that she can learn to live in this new place and let go of her old home a little bit. She had failed before because she went and spent a lot of money on a flower that was somewhat like the ones at her old home. She came home and told her mother “I-I failed the test,” her mother was shocked at first but then began to understand how her daughter felt. Her mother began to plant the flower and then went inside to cook dinner. Still feeling bad about failing the test, Saeng finished planting the flower and vowed that when the geese returned, she would take the test again.   "	13812	
10813	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph so as to end with finality. It end the story thouroughly yet in away leaves you to wonder about the future. It also leaves a tone of hope and new beginnings. For example the author uses geese to symbolize this. Geese travel south in the winter and north in the spring in “The quiet repetition of season upon season.” She uses the geese as an example of a cycle. By ending the story like this the author shows how Saeng is completing her own cycles. She tried the test but failed so she will try again. Flowers such as the hibiscus, bud in spring & die in winter only to bud again when spring returns. The author mentions this in the last paragraph as another cycle. Both cycles represent pain (migrating away & dying) & new beginnings (returning home & budding). Saeng feels pain in both failing the test and leaving her home and new beginnings in making a new home and trying again."	13813	
10814	4	The author ended her well writin story with a mysterious phrase because it wraps up what the hibicus does for Saeng. This special flower cheers up Saeng and makes her clear her mind of missing home. So that she can consitrate on her test not missing home. This home sick flower lover loves the spring. Saeng loves it because it’s when flowers bloom. She failed the test because of winter wich she dispisses	13814	
10815	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show her machority. It shows she is adapting to circumstances & being determined to survive. She is representing the hibiscus which shows the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to her past experiences, and comfort in a time of disappointment."	13815	
10816	4	She uses this sentence because it has seasons to compare to life.	13816	
10817	4	"The geese and the winter hibiscus were different than what she had known in Vietnam. She shares how they became familiar by using the seasons as guidelines  “…thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her.” When she first moved to the @CAPS1.s. many things were “strange”, or new, or hard to get used to. “Through the quiet repetition had become familiar” makes the reader understand that she views the seasons passing making her more accostomed to her surroundings and “strange” things that makes her insecure. Since she failed the test it must have been difficult for her. “strange” like the potted hibiscus. So, as the seasons have changed circumstances before. She will wait for spring to come and the hibiscus to try to change her relationship with the driver’s test. From winter to spring, from planted to budding, from failing to passing, from going south to coming back north, all of these parts to her life are connected and changing. So she concluded the essay with this paragraph to express the change that will take place, the similarity and hope that will come in the spring."	13817	
10818	4	The author author ends the story with this because Saeng din’t know how the geese and the plant are compared	13818	
10819	4	The author included used this as a conclusion to the story because it shows that Saeng did not give up hope on the driving test. The flower gave her strength to take the test again.	13819	
10820	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" ends her story by saying, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""She concludes the story with this statement because throughout the story it tells of Saeng's activities and experiences after she has failed her drivers test and Minfong Ho leads the reader on so she couldn't end the story without telling whether or not Saeng is going to retake the test or not."	13820	
10821	4	"I think the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again to emphasize Saeng’s determination in comparison to the “winter hibiscus”. The majority of the story focuses on how Saeng is having a hard time adapting to her new country and is comforted by past memories.Then she finds this plant that reminds her of home and she buys it. Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters”. In comparison I believe that the winter hibiscus represents Saeng herself, and “the cold months” represent the period of time that Saeng is struggling with trying to adapt to her new home. I think Saeng gets ispiration from this plant and she feels that if the plant can persevere through difficult times, then so can she. Which is why the author concludes that way, Saeng vowing to make it through difficult times as well."	13821	
10822	4	"In the story Winter hibiscus the author added in the sentence ‘’ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring , when the snow melts and the geese return and this  hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again.""  mostly because The last test Saeng took failed. So when spring comes back she is going to redo her test on the hibiscus. The last test Saeng did failed because  the sun had dried the hibiscus out. Then it died. Saeng decided to try again at raising a hibiscus."	13822	
10823	4	"Saeng, will have confident in taking drive test again. When spring comes and his hibiscus will budding."	13823	
10824	4	Saeng said that she thought was strange had become fimilar her days were kid of like repeating itself. I think she means that when the hibiscus gets another chanc she will get another chance. I think like almost saying starting a new life. In conclusion Saeng feels that when spring hits and everybody is reborn again into life she will be rebon again to another chance.	13824	
10825	4	"The author most likely concludes the story with this paragraph to show her new lease on life in this country and to show how she has adapted to this new environment. For example the author writes, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had, become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar...” (Ho), This quote shows how Saeng has become accustomed to her new home. Also Saeng’s mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,"" (Ho). Her mother’s statement is directly related to Saeng in how she has had to adapt her lifestyle in order to live here. It is important to analyze how changes in setting effect a character's thoughts because they drive the character development in that direction."	13825	
10826	4	"Saeng is experiencing both sadness and the impact of being out of place during the story. After failing her test she is upset but finds happiness and feels secure when she stumbles upon a @CAPS1 plant wich comforts her with memories of home. Although Saeng is faced with upsetting challenges during the story she uses the plant and mothers support to understand and adapt. As a result of this Saeng feels confedant within herself and in a way sets a internal goal of re-taking the test. This shows the reader how after being comforted and supported by her mom during a sad time, she does not give up and will continue to have self-confidence withen herself to achieve her goals.   "	13826	
10827	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants people to see how he broke it down into sector so people would read it and understand where the author was coming from. The author made it better and gave more details. For example in paragraph 1 the author was telling us reading about the girl and her mother. Her mother was very disappointed because he daughter moved from somewhere else. She had to go to a different school. The school her daughter was going to she wasn’t making very good grades and her mother wanted to get good grades. Her mom was very disappointed in that. Thats how the author concludes the story with paragraphs.	13827	
10828	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test when she got over her home sickness. I know this because right after she said she failed the test she started crying because the flower didn’t look as beautiful as the one she had at home. She also had a hard time saying the words “at home.” This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	13828	
10829	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus, by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow in order to give a there of hope and show that the hibiscus represents Saeng. She're this by giving closure, and the author's comments. If the author chose to not include Saeng's vow in the story, it would still be a good conclusion. However, the author wants to clearly show that Saeng is not giving up. She says, ""when... this hibiscus is budding, i will take the test again. Her determination puts emphasis on the theme of hope and not giving up. Saeng's vow shows that the winter hibiscus symbolizes Saeng.Saeng said that the winter hibiscus was ""Not like the kind he had before. Her mother replied,"" It flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus."" The mother knows that Saeng isn't as happy in @LOCATION1 as in Vietnam and that's why she says it is flower aren't that pretty"" representing Saeng's emotions. However, the mother also says that ""it'sstrong enough to make it through this maening that Saeng will be able to get through this down point in her life. The mother's comments and Saeng's vow give the story closure and show that saeng is a winter hibiscus that will survive to see the spring."	13829	
10830	4	"The authoR concludes this stoRy with when they came back Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test gains because I guess she think maybe that plant might be good luck foR heR next time because when she was on heR way home fRom failing the test that was the plant she seen and she @MONTH1 be thought the plant ment something."	13830	
10831	4	"The author included this to have imagrey of starting a new. Snow and winter normally mean death of sleep. Spring and budding flowers is a sign of rebirth, hope, and prosperity. This would probably mean that Saeng would pass her driver’s test."	13831	
10832	4	I think the author concluded the story with his paragraph so you could see it from two point of views.	13832	
10833	4	"The author concludes the story saying “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to her self, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she determined to take the test and the flowers make her feel at home, which makes her want to take the test again. She will want to because she’ll be ready for it."	13833	
10834	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing the reader the determination of the character Saeng. In the story Saeng has failed her driving test. So she decided to go to a greenhouse. She recognizes a familiar flower called a dok Malik. It reminded her of long lost memories. So she bought it for @MONEY1 and took it home to her mother. They decided to plant the flower and as Saeng was digging the soil. Cananda geese flew over in the sky. A reader can infer that they were leaving for warmer weather. As they flew away Saeng vowed to retake the test in the spring. I think The scene where the geese fly away represent Saeng because it shows how she @MONTH1 have messed up once but there is always a second chance. Her second chance would be when the geese return.	13834	
10835	4	The author ends the story her telling herself she isn’t going to take the test again until the snow  is melted & the geese return. She did not do so good on the test so she wants to have some time to study & prepare herself for the test. She also wants to have time to go outside & spend time with her friends. When she is outside she likes to watch the nature and the birds singing. She thinks it is   that plants grow & survive outside. That is why she wants to wait until spring to retake her test so in the   she can be out enjoying nature &   different.	13835	
10836	4	"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to show a sense of hope. In the story, Saeng had been very disappointed and upset that she had failed her driving test, She had already been upset and homesick for Vietnam, So when she came upon the familiar hibiscus flower, it not only comforted her about her test but also gave her the little piece of Vietnam that she needed. Saeng found hope in the flowers that she could make it in this new strange country. So the author ends the story by saying that when winter is over and the hibiscus start growing again, she will re-take the test because she has hope that she will pass it since the flowers are there. I think that the author did a great job of tying up the story with that paragraph because it show how Saeng has found a connection with her old country and how she bow has motivates to take the test again since she found the hibiscus flower."	13836	
10837	4	"“When they come back”, Saeng vowed silently to herself”, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with this paragraph that even though you don’t do ok the first time you try something you will always get a second chance, Saeng is comparing herself to the hibiscus and saying that that they will one bloom into something better."	13837	
10838	4	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because it shows saeng’s determination to fit in in her new environment. The winter hibiscus adapts to its environment in an effort to survive in its new habitat. This flower is used to represent Saeng because both saeng and the flower must make great changes to their lifestyle in order to survive and fit in.	13838	
10839	4	"The author included the last paragraph as a very unique, interesting metaphor to Saeng’s life. I feel that winter itself is her “hard times” and the plant is her. As with the plant, she is trying to survive. Along with that, when the gees return and its spring, she is going to start fresh and take the test again. In the last paragraph it sais, “when the snow melts  the hibiscus is budding” This budding flower is her opening up, starting again after the cold harsh winter and becoming the beautiful person she knows she is."	13839	
10840	4	"I am explaining why the author concludes the story with this last paragraph. First, in the story the flower planted at a highly patted in the @DATE1. According of what the author had saw, she remembered of her counlnel, so she was thinking of the plant and she had bought it when   them went which her mother was surprised. But what happened was that the author had told her that she did not pass her driver’s test. Still the mother was proud of her @CAPS1.  at the end of the story she had seen a geese like in her country. So meaning that her home the geese it came. How by, the author would have to take the driver’s test at again. So this is why the author had concluded the story with this small last paragraph."	13840	
10841	4	"There are many reasons why the author concluded the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author ended the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not giving up and that when spring comes around she will retake and pass the test. The reason why I think this are that it is saying that the geese are going to come back and the flowers will be blooming so everything will be fresh and new and it will be a good time to retake the test. That is why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph."	13841	
10842	4	"The author concludes the story by having Saeng say “…in the spring…I will take that test again, reffering to her drivers test that she just failed. The author does this to show that even though Saeng is feeling out of place and homesick, she is going to try harder to fit in in @LOCATION1. In the story, it talks about how much Saeng misses her grandmother and the way things used to be. when she adds these ideas, to the story, the authors is trying to portray the fact that Saeng is homesick and wishes she was back in Vietnam. When Saeng fails her driving test, it shows that she dasnt fit in very well in @LOCATION1. But at the end, when she says she will  take the test again, it shows that she is ready to make a bigger effort to fit in."	13842	
10843	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that everything connects together Saeng first gets the hibiscus after failing her driver’s test. T is becoming winter so when the plant blooms again it will belike hope and things that she is used to are restored, making it so she will have the confidence to take the test again. She realizes near the end that even the geese have become familiar to her, so when all the familiar things return like the hibiscus and the geese, she will be able to take the driver’s test again which is unfamiliar to her. During the story, she is sadden by memories of familiar plants, she starts to realize that her new country is not as strange anymore and even the things that she found strange in the beginning are gaining some familiarity. She has to adapt tochanges that can be extremely hard for anyone and the things that she finds familiar to her are helping her through it. The last paragraph has a lot of feeling as it is when Saeng seems to be filled with hope and determination which is different from the sadness and longing of the rest of the story. This is the author’s version of a happy ending, where the mood changes from sad to determined and hopeful as Saeng realizes things really aren’t that bad. Many author’s use happy endings after sad story because it indures a feeling of hope in the reader at the end which makes the story plesant to read"	13843	
10844	4	"The author is showing that by the time the birds adapt and change she will be ready to adapt. As seasons change and the flowers bloom, she will be able to change and evatually bloomin her new country."	13844	
10845	4	"When the author states “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” It means it is the changing if the seasons and her favorite time of the year is back. The author puts this at the end of the story because it gives the character in the story a sense of hope for the plants and for her to do good on the test."	13845	
10846	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to emphasize the impact that the hibiscus plant has on Saeng. For example, in the text, the author writes, “'What happened?' she asked, more gently. ‘I-I failed the test.’ ” The quote emphasizes one of the conflicts in the story. Saeng has just failed a test and is afraid of her mother’s reaction. The test is what has her upset throughout the story. However, in the last paragraph, Saeng looks at the flower and realizes that she can rely on it to comfort her. This is why she says that when the hibiscus is budding, she can take the test. It can give her something to comfort her and prepare her for the test. Also, the other conflict in the story is the fact that Saeng misses her mother and her homeland. In the story, the author writes, “But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng misses her old country and her grandmother. Because she misses these two precious items, she spends the extra money to buy the hibiscus plant. So she can look at the plant and have those fond memories of fixing the grandmother’s hair. Possibly, she could have been thinking of these grievances while taking the test. By having that hibiscus plant bud in the end, the author is showing how Saeng knows that everything is going to be okay. All good stories must end with a conflict resolution. By ending the story with the chosen paragraph, the author is solving the conflict of the test and the memories. When the plant buds, Saeng will always have it to comfort her and provide her with those fond memories. The hibiscus plant provides the resolution to the two main conflicts of “Winter Hibiscus.”    "	13846

Throughout the exerpt, Saeng becomes overwhelmed with disappointment a grief for her drivers test and homeland.

When Saeng comes across the flower she used to know from her childhood she has a flashback about the well, her grandmother, and the fine tooth comb she put in her granda’s hair. The flowers brought her closer to the memories of the things she had and did in Vietnam. Saeng is shown determined when she states, “When they come back then I will take the test again. Athough she failed the test she is willing to try again. The author uses the last paragraph to show the readers that although Saeng is not fully accustomed to the american life, she is willing to try harder and succeed. "	13848	
10849	4	The Author used this as conclusion to make the connection between the Hibiscus and the memory. and how the memory will come back to her. As the geese come back when the snow melts. Saeng is very fond of those memorys and @MONTH1 need to use the hibiscus as a memory and the geese as a time when she leaves at the memory	13849	
10850	4	"The author of “ winter Hibiscus “ concludes the  short  story This  way because in the very  beginning  of  the  story  one  has  just  failed her  arivers  test  and goes unto the  flower  shop  for  comfort, her memories of @ORGANIZATION1  deep  emotions  and  she  is  more  comfortable in the spring time because of the  flowers  and the  geese  and  the  memory of her hometown.

10851	4	"The authoR concludes the story with this paragraph because he thought it was a very important line to add at end of the story. Also, Its a nice way to end a stoRy with a paragraph like that. For example, that paragraphs tells that the @CAPS1 what Saeng is thinking. And her next move when she comes back. AnotheR @CAPS2 why he concludes this story with this paragraph because the authoR wanted to let everyone how the plant changed her life. In @CAPS3 this is why the authoR concludes the story with this paragraph."	13851	
10852	4	"The author conclude this paragraph to the story so that the reader will have something to thing about when they look back at the story. It’s Like a question with no anwer or a movie that's half done, that question draw you back for answers. In the story this mean that the girl is not giving op on that test, She is going to make her mother proud."	13852	
10853	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she learn about Saeng’s is much responsible of the things. Also, what I can say is that this author know how to use personal stuff about the character. The author includes main ideas and textures. The character shows kind of humor that this should a good story."	13853	
10854	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a certain paragraph about Saeng vowing to take the driving test again. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus brings hope to Saeng. Saeng’s mother says “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok Faeng-noi,” (Ho @NUM1). Dok Faeng-noi is the @CAPS1 word for hibiscus. Saeng moved to the United States, but is still homesick for Vietnam, Saeng’s mother knows that she she liked Vietnam. She also knows that the plant reminds her of her home, which is a good memory. Later, her mother says “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” (Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizies that if the hibiscus can survive in a climate different from where it was bred and created, then Saeng can survive in a different place that is not her old home. The author concluded the story with a certain paragraph to show how the hibiscus gave hope to Saeng."	13854	
10855	4	"THE AUTHOR FROM THE STORY ""WINTER HIBISCUS"" ENDED WITH ""WHEN THEY COME BACK…TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN"" TO CONVEY HER DETERMINATION TO PASS THE TEST. SINCE SHE FAILED HER DRIVER'S TEST. SHE IS DETERMINED TO DO WELL NEXT TIME. THE HIBISCUS AND GESSE REPRESENT RENEWEL IN THAT BOTH GET A NEW START EVERY YEAR: NEW BUDS WILL GROW ON THE HIBISCUS AND THE GESSE WILL GET TO COME TO A NEW  WARM LAND AFTER A LONG WINTER IN CONCLUSION; THIS QUOTE WAS CHOSEN TO END THIS STORY BECAUSE IT EXPRESSES A NEW START."	13855	
10856	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because many times the last lines of a story are very important. this is especially true in the case. The last paragraph of the story talk about Saeng taking the test again. The test was very important to Saeng and her mother. I know this because in the story it says. “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words ‘at home.’"" she was too shaky after she informed her mother of the fact that she did not pass the test. The author concluded the story with @CAPS1’ vow that she will take the test again to leave an immpression. The immpression that was left was that Saeng will not give up, she will try to take the test again next year."	13856	
10857	4	"The author concluded with that paragraph. Because it represent Saeng feeling at the end of the story I “@CAPS1 that when the snows melt’’ mean more then the coming of spring. It also means when she is more adjusted to the move, almost like in reserance to herself. Also the @CAPS2 ‘’This hibiscus is budding ‘’means, in my opinion, that she will be ready, she will be ready to take the driving test again, and also the test to see if she will handle the move better to you than. This story has a double meaning on one meaning is the of spirit and on the other is the last of life and driving then reason the another concludes this story with this paragraph is because it represents Saeng’s feeling.      "	13857	
10858	4	"The author concludes this paragraph to better the understanding that people should give it their all and try. Saeng does not give up. So she will again try her test. The author wants people to know that even if you fail once you should go back @NUM1 times harder and try again, @CAPS1 at the end you will be the victorious."	13858	
10859	4	"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because this paragraph expresses Saeng feelings at the begining of a new season and how the plants will die off. For example, Saeng says “when the snow melts and the geese return” which is refering to winter. In conclusion, this paragraph was choicen to be last because of the change of the season."	13859	
10860	4	"The author concludes the story with that quote because. It closes he sad emotions and out of place feeling. But yet opening a story of her starting a new life in a new place and how the plants especially the Hibiscus contributed to that. For example “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair. As you can tell from that small quote. You can see that the smell of the flower brings her back into the past where she felt warm, comfortable, and the times she spent with her grandmother in a familiar place she reconizes. Another example would be, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand new, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.” In the quote Saeng holds on tight to try to feel something that will remind her of home. She tries to seek same sort of motivation deep  within her she can embrace to learn to go on in @LOCATION1 making it a little like home something  she can relate and that is what the flower gives her and @LOCATION1 a rezemlence of Vietnam. And that is why the author concludes the story with the quote. “when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.”"	13860	
10861	4	"Minfong Ho, the author or “Winter Hibiscus” ends her story with this paragraph for a specific reason. In this way, Saeng can start over, start fresh and try again just as the geese and the hibiscus will. She will start over because she will take the test again from the beginning. The geese come back in the spring and start over with their lies. The hibiscus will bloom and start over and live. Saeng will start fresh by ridding herself of the feeling of failure, When she takes the test again she will not feel the way. The hibiscus will start its life with new petals and beauty. Saeng will also be trying again. After her first failure, she has not given up or passing the driving test. The geese have not given up migrating and the hibiscus will not give up blooming. Thus @CAPS1 Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that she is similar to the geese and the hibiscus and needs to take the test again."	13861	
10862	4	"The author concludes the story with the quoted paragraph to emphasize the character, saeng's usilience winter is used as a symbol of hardships, whereas the geese and the hibiscus draws parallels to saeng. Just as they will endure the winter, so shall she endure,the changes in her life. The budding of the hibiscus beeing mentioned forshadows that she will achieve her goals, and ends the story on a hopeful note."	13862	
10863	4	"The final paragraph was used by the author to leave a feeling of beginning anew and adapting to new things. In the story, it tells of how saeng and her mother had to move to the @LOCATION1 and leave their home country, and when saeng sees the geese migrating like she had to do once, she realizes that there is always hope and that she should try the best again and perservere just like the geese .Therefore, the geese’s journey is a metaphor to the reader about perserviring and adopting to new challenges. Such as saeng’s new life in the @CAPS1.S and her upcoming test also, the hibiscus plant that the last paragraph raferences is representative of saeng’s past and helps her remember her homeland. This is also a metaphor of how saeng with be able to take the test again and begin anew. In conclusion, the last paragraph uses metaphors such as the seasons, the geese, and the hibiscus plant to symbolize the new start that saeng has in the new place and her new start of the test."	13863	
10864	4	Saeng  and  her  mother  where  out  side  digging  holes  for  planting  and  then  saeng  mother  took  ahot  papper  and bitter  melons  and  went  inside to go start  them dinner.	13864	
10866	4	"I believe the author choose that specific paragraph to end their story in order to finish the @CAPS1. This is because throughout her life, Saeng has had to perservere to adapt and survive. Therefor her past experiences will not allow here to give up. She has put so much into trying to become american that she cannot let this one bump in the roud stop her. Another reason is that the @CAPS1 of the story is perserverence. The author had to finish the @CAPS1 and tie up the last lose strand. Since the background stories were perserverence, they had to tie the main story line into the them. The last paragraph allows him to do that. Lastly the hibiscus symbolizes perserverence. Not only can it last through harsh winters, but it connects Saeng to her past and allows her to see where she has come from in order to more clearly see where she is going. All three of these are valid reasons for using that specific paragraph to conclude this piece.   "	13866	
10867	4	"The authur concludes the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. For example they go together because their talking about the same things."	13867	
10868	4	The author adds this paragraph to show the respect of saeng because tha paragraph says would think the author intended to show his good side saying that he would take the test over.	13868	
10869	4	"I think that the author concludes the Story in this way, since she failed the test and She learned so much about the hibiscus and she was learning about this for the first time. It seems to me. So now that she tryed it out she can now wait till next year to take the test again. I also think that it meant a lot to her mother since the mom gardens and plants that she would want her to do it also. I think the author concluded this story in a good way."	13869	
10870	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows hope after failing the test and thinking about her grandmother, this paragraph shows hope that everything will be all right and how important  it is to believe that better times will come again. Also this paragraph is a good conclusion because it the shows the resuet of the author’s experience and it combines her sadness with looking forward to better times. Another reason why the author uses this paragraph as a conclusion for the story is because she wants to show that the bad things in life should never overshadow the good things that will follow. There is a second chance to make things better and people should concentrate on that instead of thinking so much about the past and regretting things that cant be changed anymore. All in all this paragraph is a good conclusion that gives the story a positive ending and something to look forward to."	13870	
10871	4	"The author ended the story with this paragraph due to many reasons. Saeng has failed the test and thats where she finds the beautiful plant. Then the plant remind of her memories and then saeng starts to go deeply in her thoughts. Past pain him again deeply flower in the calculata percule eraser lead succed steuperer corelusa theme sutatan stary settings maps alust internet.

Tage are the countries choses of words and memories form to pass"	13871	
10872	4	The author uses the @CAPS1 to finish the story. Because it gives hope and @CAPS2 it also provides connection   Between  the plant and the girl. The @CAPS1 gives hope by the time spring comes   I will @CAPS4 well on the test. The @CAPS1 also shows @CAPS2 of the young girl she vowed or promised herself she would. @CAPS4 well on the test. The main reason the author put the @CAPS1 in the end of the story to @CAPS8 a connection between   the plant and the main character Saeng. If the plant can live through the winter then the girl can pass the test the plant was a way for the girl to retain hope and @CAPS2. In conclusion the @CAPS1 shows that the girl is still hope full. The main purpose for the @CAPS1 is to provide a connection Between the girl and the plant for @CAPS12 of them to surive  a hard time	13872	
10873	4	This is a very nice paragraph that the author uses in the story	13873	
10874	4	"The author of the ended the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” to give the reader a sign of hope. The whole story was related, and connected with nature. The flower Saeng bought represented her homeland so close the story, the author related to nature. Because the tone of the story is slightly upsetting to end on a positive note the author gave a sign of hope. Spring, is a season of new life and happiness after the harsh Winter, which is representative of Saeng's life. She was struggling  in the story built hopefully with the spring will bring changes and happiness for her. That is what I feel  the author is trying to relate across to the reader with that conclusion."	13874	
10875	4	There could be many reasons why the author concluded the story with this sentence. One reason could be the author is trying to say since she was not successful the first time she wants to try again. Maybe she wanted to make her mother proud. It could be many different reasons. So this is why the author might have picked that senence to end the story. 	13875	
10876	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows a sign of hope for Saeng. She is having troubles adjusting with her new @CAPS1 life, and she failed the driver’s test. Stopping in a flower shop on her way home, she notices the Hibiscus. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral” (HO). It reminded her of her home life in Vietnam, so she bought it despite the high price. Although it is not the same exact plant she had in Vietnam, her mother tells her “it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. “ the flower is a parallel to Saeng’s life. Although it ius hard for her to live in @LOCATION2, like it is hard for the flower to make it through the winter, Saeng will make it through. Thus, she states “when this hibiscus is budding, I will take that last again.” If the flower can make it through the winter so can she.  "	13876	
10877	4	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to show Saeng is confident in herself. She had failed the test before and was ashamed by it. ""'I- I failed the test.'"" She sort of stutters because she didn't want to tell her mother she had failed because she was so ashamed of herself. In the final paragraph it is saying how when it is nice again Saeng will take the test again. She has enough confidence in herself to take this test again. She says when the birds come back and the hibiscus is budding she will know everything is fine. She wants to prove she is able to take this test and pass it. Saeng doesn't want her mother to be upset about it again so it is putting pressure on her. Saeng is very confident in herself though and will be perfectly fine when the test comes again."	13877	
10878	4	"The author more in likely chose to end it like this because, it taught that with an end comes a new beginning. Alo because it means that one can start anew. Essentially the author ended with the moral of the story."	13878	
10879	4	The Author @CAPS1 the story with a strong statement becAuse it shows that Saeng can and will adapt to @CAPS2 home. I know this becAuse when she got here she took her driving test and failed. She was upset about that she misses her home land she @CAPS3 that if the plant can have a @CAPS4 @CAPS2 start after winter then so can she. So when the plant starts a @CAPS2 season as Budding she will start a @CAPS2 life too.	13879	
10880	4	"The author concludes the story with when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She said that because the plant is comforting to her. For example she is remined of home, which comforts her, so she should be prepared, emotionall with confidence for the test."	13880	
10881	4	"I think the poet ends the story with the paragraph that he does because the ending is strong and has meaning. “Then I will take the test again.” The story states the when the geese started honking, everything started to become more familiar to her and when she says test I think of remembrance because for a test you have to know the stuff and remember it, and I guess she will test herself and where she put the Hibiscus. I think she did this vow silently to herself because it’s a promise only to her and no one else because maybe no one else would understand. Endings like this make stories better like this better in the sense that you can feel the imagery."	13881	
10882	4	Saeng might want to pass the test really bad. Before she felt really sad & down and now that she’s made a comitment she’s going to try to hold on to it.	13882	
10883	4	"The author concludes the story with with this paragraph @CAPS1 this paragraph explains, the plot of the story. So if the author did not conclude the story with this paragraph then this wouldn't, be very interest story to some who reads its. Some would like this story and some people wouldn’t @CAPS1 with that last paragraph then you can close it up. "	13883	
10884	4	"The end to a story leaves the reader with a certain mood; some @MONTH1 give a feel of incompleteness others a sense of forboding, and still others a feel of revitalization. The author used the story’s ending to help the reader continue the story for himself through the use of foreshadowing. “I will take that test again” lets the reader know she will take the driving test again, and “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” tells the reader she will go in the spring time. The ending leaves the reader wanting to know what happens next and how Saeng ends up in the adaptation process. It effectively draws the reader into wanting to read more of the story."	13884	
10885	4	"In my oponion the author concluded the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. Two of which are when the flower starts budding it will remind her of her old home in Vietnam.  The other reason is that when the geese return it will remind her of her new home. While Saeng lived in Vietnam her family had a garden and a well outside of their house. The garden and well were surrounded by a hibiscus hedge like the flower she bought. So in the spring when the flower starts budding it will remind her of the flower buds she would find inside of the well after a storm. This will bring joy to her and allow to be happy in her new home @CAPS1 she has been living in the @CAPS2.S for a few years now, she is starting to recognize some of the sounds. The sound of the geese is one of them that brings joy to her."	13885
