StrAP is a stream clustering method based on Affinity Propagation (AP).

It was firstly proposed in the paper:

	Xiangliang Zhang, Cyril Furtlehner, Michele Sebag, "Data streaming with Affinity propagation". Proceedings of  European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML/PKDD'2008), Antwerp, Belgium, pp. 628-643.

Then, its parameter setting is online adapted as proposed in paer:

	Xiangliang Zhang, Cyril Furtlehner, Julien Perez, Cecile Germain,  Michele Sebag, " Toward Autonomic Grids: Analyzing the Job Flow with Affinity Streaming" . Proceedings of 15th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD'2009), Paris, France, June 28 ~ July 1, 2009

Compared to StrAP_Matlabl,
StrAP_Matlabl_full = StrAP_Matlabl + parameter online adaption function.
It added the parameter online adaption function.
If you do not want to use the adaption part, just set the adaption parameters as 0 (unusable).

StrAP is an effective and efficient stream clustering method.
In this Matlab package, 1% of the KDDcup 99 data is tested for demonstration.

Usage:
in Matlab, type

clustering_stream_byStrAP

or

clustering_stream_bykcc  (used as baseline)


you will get the clustering results saved as "resI.mat",
"I" is a number, e.g., 1,2,3,...,  each "resI.mat" contains the clustering results in 30 restarting steps.

clustering accuracy and purity will be also shown in figures.

The adaption of lambda process in save as
"lambda_adaption_by_egreedy.mat" when using e-greedy search,
"lambda_adaption_by_gp.mat" when using gaussian process regression.

see FAQ for more information.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Parameter setting:

in clustering_stream_byStrAP.m  or  clustering_stream_bykcc.m, the parameters for StrAP or Streaming-k-centers
can be set according to the application requirement.
 
'distance' 		the threshold for comparing new point with the model, deciding whether it should go to the Reservoir

'is_label_num' 		the label is numerical (1) or categorical(0)

'Max_cache' 		the maximum size of Reservoir  (used as the criterion for triggering restart)
 
'PH'			use (1) or not-use (0) Page-Hinkley as the criterion for triggering restart

'delt'			PH tolerance parameter,  a small real value

'lambda'		PH parameter, threshold for PH determining the detection of changes

'damp'			AP parameter, damping factor valued between 0 and 1

'X'			decay window lightening the weight of old clusters.

'all_R' 		in PH case, using all elements in Reservoir for restarting ? (1, yes) (0, no, only latest 300)

'cm'			in streaming k-centers,  the proportion of centers from memory for k-centers initial selection of centers, K*cm number of initial centers are from the previous model (memory) when restarting

'egreedy'		use e-greedy search to adapt the value of lambda (threshold for PH)

'gp'			use gaussian process regression to adapt the value of lambda (threshold for PH)

'random_start'		the number of first restarting steps in which 'lambda' is set randomly in the given range

Files:

clustering_stream_byStrAP.m	is the main program used to cluster the streaming dataset (e.g., KDDcup 99) by StrAP, as we described in the Reference paper.

stream_AP_load.m	StrAP, in which the data can be load-in once
stream_AP_read.m        StrAP, in which the data can be read line by line (if the data is too huge to be load)

build_cluster.m		build the clustering model

update_cluster.m	update the clustering model after restarting

com_accu.m		compare the true label and given label

draw_accu.m		draw the clustering accuracy in figure, output the accuracy, error rate, outliers rate
draw_purity.m		draw the clustering purity in figure, output the purity
model_online_report.m	online clustering output demonstrated by bars

update_context.m	update the 'label_all' in model
update_context_2.m	update the 'label_all' in model
	
uniq_my.m		get the unique elements and their counts
uniq_my_rows.m		get the unique rows and their counts
uniq_my_cell.m		get the unique cells and their counts

similarity_nse.m	used to obtain the negative squared error(Euclidean distance) for each pair of examples.

apclustermex.m      	clustering method AP
apclustermex_.mexglx  	mex of AP for Linux system
apclustermex_.mexa64  mex of AP for Linux64 system
apclustermex_.mexw32  	mex of AP for Windows system

clustering_stream_bykcc.m   is the main program of clustering streams by streaming k-centers method (used as a baseline) 

stream_kcc_load.m	streaming k-centers method in the same framework as StrAP (just replace AP with k-centers, WAP with kcc_memory)

kcc.m                 	k-centers  clustering method
kcc_memory.m		k-centers  clustering method with memory, which means the initially selected centers are partly from the given set.

data/			has the 1% of KDDcup 99 data for testing, data and label

egreedy_lambda.m	get appropriate value for lambda using e-greedy search 

gp_lambda.m		get appropriate value for lambda using gaussian process regression
