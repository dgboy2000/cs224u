Better coding:
    - Refactor 'kaggle.py' to be more general
    - Use constants throughout all code for the data files (stop using the strings)
    - Automatic creation of data/corpus.txt

Things to consider:

- Uni/bi-grams: 
    - Different corpus?
    - Different ordering of words for feature selection (i.e., instead of raw frequency)
    - Better filtering of non-relevant words? (i.e., get rid of stop words, etc.)
    - Check out better tokenization :: nltk.download() will get us nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')
- How to build a more general model using all of the entry sets, and not just learning on each set?
