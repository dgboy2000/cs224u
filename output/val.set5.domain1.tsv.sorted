2	2	4	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was happy and thankful. His parents taught him many things about their cuban back ground, like cooking and music. His parents gave up many things to comfort Narciso and make him at home. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." His parents turned their house into a home for other People as well. "My parents always kept their Arms and door open to the many people we considered family." Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents were very loving to the community and help out as much as the could in making that place at home.
2	2	4	The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
2	1	3	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well.
1	4	3	narciso Rodriguez is a clothing designer who wrote a memoir Home: The blueprints of our lives. The mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that surrounds the meaning of family and home.narciso says in the memoir in @CAPS1 @NUM1 "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the Aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to lif in our warm home." That proves that narcisos house was a warm family home, that was alway welcaming.narcisos comunity was also close like a family. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it proves this when saying "Close – knit community of hones, hard working imigrants who extent a hand to people who were clearly in need". He also states that blood does'nt mean your family. Like his surrogate grandparents. In @CAPS1 @NUM3 he proves that his parents were alway welcoming – "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.
1	4	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his " family". He says, "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1"  In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a "family". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this was grateful and happy.
1	4	3	The mood in the memoir is mostly gratefulness and happiness. The author describes his house as "... our traditional Cuban home,...", "... unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today." This explaines that even though the author is an adult he still has the pasion that his parents had together when he was a kid. The author realizes that "family doesn't mean blood realated" it's about being around people that he loves and making things out of the little moments in life. The article states "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows that the author admires his parents for everything they have given up to get to where they are now. The end of the memoir explaines that the author is grateful for living in that house, and having all the people around him. He learned the real definition of what "family" means and what love truely is.
1	4	3	The mood created for me in this memoin is a grateful, happy, and mostly thankful mood. I believe the mood is grateful because it is mentioned by the narrator many times like during the third paragraph where he mention how grateful he is to have parents who made good meals and taught him how to cook. Also he said he was grateful for being introduced to cuban music. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because although the hardships are mentioned it wasn't about how they struggled but how the concoured the hardships they faced when immigrating to @LOCATION1. Another way this memoir is happy is because he talks about how happy everyone is and how family makes a house turn into a home it just touches your heart and gives you a sence of happiness. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a thank you letter to the narator's parents. That is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful, happy, and mostly thankful.
1	4	3	The mood created by the author is a happy reflective memoir on the family life of the author growing up. It talks about how warm and caring the authors household was and how it got to be like that     The author sets the mood in the menoir by talking about what was going on n the household "Our traditional Cuban home, where the very heart of which was the kitchen." The author talks about her families love for cooking and happy mood of the house with the "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen". The author also talks about the close knit community of honest hard working migrants who ** in the surrounding homes they were all friends that took care of eachother, knowing that anyone would do the same for them as well.  The author is able to keep the mood happy in the memoir by talking about how he will "always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" @CAPS1 it as a loving caring story to read about @PERSON1's childhood.
1	4	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness.     One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture. "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." This shows that he is grateful of his culture.       Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. "Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table." This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has.      Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..." This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are.
1	4	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving, caring, and heartwarming. The memoir had a loving mood because the author talks about friends and family and how important loved ones are. In the selection it said ", the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our home." Also, the author creates a caring mood throughout the story, from him to his parents. For example, "My parents always kept their arms and their door open." and "I will always be grateful to my parents,". The author also creates a heartwarming mood in the memoir when he said, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." These are the few moods created by the author in the memoir.
1	4	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says "and for which I am extremily grateful." @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says "I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him."I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions.
1	4	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate. The reason I would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is. When Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in cuba he never mentioned anything about what he hated about his family and about living in cuba. yet he describes all of what he loved about growing up as a child for example he says "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This shows that just because your  not related by blood does'nt mean your not family. Another reason why I would describe the mood of the authour as soft in compassionate is at the end of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."In conclusion those are the ways why I would describe the mood created by the author as soft and compassionate. 
1	4	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very sad, loving, caring. @CAPS2 @NUM1 states "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could of ever done." @CAPS1 he is very respectful to his parents, thanks them for making a great life for him. Also in @CAPS2 @NUM1 states "They showned me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life." @CAPS1 whatever occurs you always go back to your roots. And how important family, and friends are. The real @CAPS1 of "family" through this kids eyes.
1	4	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud This is the mood because he is showing thanks to all of the things that he learned in his childhood that he is proud of. One example of this is when the author talks about his Cuban heritage and how he still loves Cuban music. He is also proud for his parents immagrating to the @LOCATION1 to start a better life for him. He is also proud because even though the other people that lived in the neighborhood with him were of different backgrounds everyone accepted eachother. Another reason he is proud is because his parents would help give so many people home to stay in. The author is most proud of his parents because of tier love and sacrifice. They were loving to all and they sacrificed a lot to get to where they were. The mood of the author in the memoir is that he is very proud in what his parents have done. 
1	4	3	The mood and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents.
1	4	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home." The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories. Anothe reason is how grateful the author sounds. It says, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a family. @CAPS1 says, "It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful." @CAPS1 learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir @CAPS1 creates a very happy mood.
1	4	3	The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger.
1	4	3	The author creates many woods in this memoir. Firstly, a mood that the author sets is warmth. Figuretive warmth. For example in paragraph @NUM1, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home." which is a perfect description of some thing that makes you feel warm inside.Secondly, another mood the author sets is compassion because he talkes fondly and with compassion for his parents. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, "My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the knd of jobs they desurved... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times." Which @CAPS1 very compationate and full of emotion.Lastly, a mood I think the author sets is acceptance, because his parent were so willing to take in people that werent always blood related. for example in paragraph @NUM3, "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Which States that they were very welcoming and accepting people.These are the moods the author created in this memoir.
1	4	3	Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for what his parents gave him, thus that is the overlying mood in the memoir, being thankful. Rodriguez was thankful that his parents came over from Cuba to give him a better life. Even though he says that his parents had to leave behind "family, friends, and careers in the country they loved." Rodriguez is also thankful that his parents taught him selfless ness + generosity. For example, he says "there was often someone staying with us temporarely until they were able to get ba- ck on their feet." It is very genorous to help some body in that way. Over all Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture. Cuban culture encompasses cooking & music, but most impo- rtant ly family, having nothing to do with being a blood relative, but the fact that you have respect + love for everyone. The mood of this memoir is being thankful and is presented in all these different ways.
1	4	3	In this memoir, the author creates a mood. The mood is love. The author loves his parents for all the things they sacraficed to come to @LOCATION1. He really appreciates everything they've done for him and he is really grateful.The author describes the "warmth" of his kitchen. How it's filled with love and culture. The great aroma of their parents cooking and the music from his culture, he loves it.The author also describes how his family is @CAPS1 close, and their friends to. The love that they got for each other. The memoir says "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us." @CAPS1 they considered people who weren't really family... Family. They helped each other out, family and friends, that's what creates the mood to be love.@CAPS1, in this memoir, the author creates a mood and its LOVE.
1	4	3	In this memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, he portrayed a very specific mood. This mood made me feel that I was there, or part of the story that he was telling. I felt this way because by familiarizing your readers with your characters, that makes writing the rest of the story a lot easier. For example, in paragraph two, I was able to get a sense of what his home and family life was like-especially with this line, "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen." @CAPS1 line that I felt was special to the story was, "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need" I liked this statement especially because it showed me, as the reader, how caring those people were. It also brightened the mood of the whole story. The overall mood of this memoir, I feel, was clearly depicted.
1	4	3	In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one.One example on how its warm is how he discribes the home. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1. "Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen." This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet eromahs of delicious food in the oven.A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, "All of theus cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." It is nice because there was alot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together.The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he apreciates what his parents have done. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, "I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever don." This is saying that he is greatfull that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life.Thats why I think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice.
1	4	3	In this memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives @CAPS2 Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the story really translates the way the reader is reading it. As Narciso live in this small house it becomes his whole life. And his life revoles around his family. "I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home." (@CAPS1 @NUM1) @CAPS2 this simple hous it changed his whole life. As @CAPS3 grew up many of his blood relations were not near where they lived but his neighbor were like his family. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative." (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 figured that people close to him was his family. The unique tradition of daily routines his family did really becam a part of his life. "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." (@CAPS1 @NUM3) these little things like music or the smell from the kitchen had a memorable impact on his life. In conclusion, the mood created in this memoir was created @CAPS2 these tradishon of his family
1	4	3	In the story I just read, "Narciso Rodriguez" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. "My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family." I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story.
1	4	3	In the memoir, the mood that is created by author is a loving and grateful mood towards the author's parents. A example from the memoir is when the author talks about his gratefulness toward his parents. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful toward his parents because he mentions his gratefulness towards them. Another example is when the author tells the reader that his parents showed him two important lessons that he chose for the basis of his life. "They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful towards his parent's because the author tells the reader that what they did helped him become a great/better person. Lastly, when the author tells the reader that he is grateful for the fact that his parents gave up their life in cuba to make his life better. "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life" (paragraph @NUM3). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and greatful because he expresses what his parents did for him and it shows that he feels greatful that they did that. The author creates a loving and greatful mood toward his parents in this memoir.
1	4	3	In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, "passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,"... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..." (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, "My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed.
1	4	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is gratitude. First, Narciso loved his parents and was very grateful for everything they did. Rodriguez says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice" (@NUM1). Narciso's parents came to the US just for him and he is so grateful. Secondly, he says he has thanked them so many times but he doesn't know how. Rodriguez says, "There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me" (@NUM1). He is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it in words @CAPS1, Narciso knows even though they only had a three – room apartment he knew it was special. Narciso states, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM3). His parents couldnt give him much because they didn't have much money but it meant the world to him Clearly, the mood of this passage is gratitude
1	4	3	In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a very strong mood, and describes it very well. The mood of the story is happiness. One way the author describes this is with all the appretation in the memoir. The author really appretaties all the things his parents have done for him, that were really hard for them to do. "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life." One more way the author reinforced the mood is with the carring in the story. Narciso cares so much for everything his parents did for him. Also, how his family would let other relatives stay with them and care for them. Lastly, all the culture helps the mood. The description of the cuban food and music and how they celebrate creates happy thoughts in the reader's mind. As you can see, the author was very good at creating a mood.
1	4	3	In the memoir @PERSON1 it talks about making a house a home and a community, your family. "Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that "Family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative" (par @NUM1) paragraph @NUM1 goes onto talk about how growing up with Italian, Spanish, and Cuban cultures in one community, with all differences aside made the community into a family. Rodriguez talks very warmly, and with only good things to say about his childhood.the mood of the memoir is Rodriguez remembering his culture filled childhood. "I learned the real definition of "family". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love" (par seven) The memoir is a dedication to his life and a reflection of all the experiences had within his family. He writes his memoirs in loving spirits dedicating his knowledge of a "family" to his own.
1	4	3	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a mood of happyness created. There are several examples from the article that show happyness. The first example is "they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. The third and final example is "It was here I learded the true definition of family." Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his "family" and although he didn't know all of his "real" family he was happy with the one he had. Those three examples show the mood of the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez".
1	4	3	In the @ORGANIZATION1 amemorie when in 1961 Narciso was born into a simple house. A cuban home filled with traditions, and the very heart of whitch was the kitchen. His parents who loved to cook is still with him today and for whitch I am eternally grateful. Passionate music witch he adores today. His neighborhood was madeup of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants like his family. His mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge or the culture. They came to selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and career in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. His mood shows lots of positive thing's about his family being proud what he is and what he stands for having the blood of being cuban. He seems very pleased on his familyes sucsess.
1	4	3	In "Narciso Rodriguez" the most imp-ortant thing is love. It talks about how much Narciso cares for his family.The mood is love, admiration and gratefulness. Narci-so is so grateful for what his parents did for him. To give up everything to go to a better place. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." says Narciso. Another m-ood is also love. In the memoir it express-es a great deal of love that's in his family. ".. It meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved". They gave up everything for Narciso who they truely love. You get the feel of admiration when Narciso says "They showed me with thier lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life".The overall feelings of the memoir is love, admiration and gratefulness. Narciso learned a lot from his family. "I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home".
1	4	3	If I were to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir I would say it is positive and thankful. I am saying positive because he regards his childhood so respectfully and proudly; like how he describes his neighborhood as: "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." From this quote you can tell that the author held his community in the highest of regards, as family. I describe it as thankful because based on this exerpt, you can determine that the author was taught family morals, and was raised in a household rich in Cuban culture. This mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home. The author learned the significance of his Cuban heritage, and the sacrifices his parents made to come to @LOCATION1, which in no words can he thank them enough for their selflessness.
1	4	3	I think the mood of the author is love and family. In this article, he keeps saying how grateful he is to his parents. A quote proving this is "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This quote shows that he loved how his parents loved him, and made sacrifices for him, and he will always be grateful to them. He also says that he now knows the true definition of family. A quote proving this is "... Family had nothing to do with a blood relative." This quote shows that even if people aren't blood-related, they are still family. Narciso Rodriguez says that his parents welcomed anyone with open arms. A quote proving this is "it was in this house where my parents welcomed other refugees..." This quote shows how loving his family was. Family really is a strong bond that will last forever.
1	4	3	I particularly enjoyed this memoir. The author did a fantastic job at creating a sense of love and comfort while telling his story. The first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @NUM1: "Passionate  Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said "My parents  always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home. This story was truly filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort, and I really enjoyed reading it.

1	3	4	The moods created by the author in the memoir is happiness, love, and gratitude To start, it made me feel happy because of  the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. "cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. "I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..." I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." I would be grateful also. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it.

"I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey." That @CAPS2 that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. "It was here where I learned the real definition of family...

Also, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life".

"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need".
1	3	4	The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture." They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." (paragraph @NUM2). @PERSON2's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them @PERSON2 lived a life filled with happiness and love.
1	3	4	The mood in "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives is grateful. This is shown by how Narciso explains in detail the major chronologically ordered events his life.

This happens for example when Narciso states: "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."

His neighborhood was different than much of @LOCATION2 because "all of these cultures [Spanish, Cuban, Italian] came together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS1 expressed the love his parents had by explaining their hard work as they experience financial and personal struggles. "@CAPS1 says @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family through his parents, and is very grateful. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."
1	3	4	The mood created by the author of the memior exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks alot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice, in their lives. "Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ..."In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity". Another mood the author captures is greatfullness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."

1	3	4	The mood created by the author in this memoir is over all warm. @CAPS1 explains the positive things about his home and where @CAPS1 grew up. @CAPS1 also explains the positive things about his family and culture, which @CAPS1 is very proud of. @CAPS1 says "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." @CAPS1's basically saying that @CAPS1 realized that all the people that lived around him came together and all connected somehow with their cultures, which made them all feel like family. @CAPS1 also explains how gratefull @CAPS1 is to have his parents who did so much for their children to have a better life.

1	3	4	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, "It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love." The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, "They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love." This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories.
1	3	4	The mood created by the author in this memoir is lovable. Narciso Rodriguez said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done. Also, the mood is grateful. In the memoir, it says that Narciso thanked his parents repeatedly for what they have done. He also states, "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close – knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants, who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." That shows that he is grateful to have friends and family. Also, the mood is caring. This is because he stated that her parents came sefflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their friends and jobs.
1	3	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez which show what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba to their love. As said his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future, by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though "they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships." they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. "The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love". This memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, thats why at the end of the word "family" the i, l, y stand for "i love you."
1	3	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show gratefulness towards the author's parents. He wanted to portray the fact that his parents sacrifice their lives for the author's life.Narciso repeatedly conveys the message that "family had nothing to do with being a blood relative", but people who care for one another; people who "come together in great solidarity and friendship".The most important family to Narciso are his parents who sacrifice their lives, in order "to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved". He says that he will always be grateful to his parents. He admits "that what they did was a much more courageous thing than "he" could have ever done". Narciso infact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are.In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself.
1	3	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, the author talks a lot about family. And even though they weren't blood related, he considered many people his family. In the text it says "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great Solidarity and Friendship. It was a close-knit community...." @CAPS1 example of the mood being loving is the author talks about his parents being selfless and leaving so much behind. And they did all that just to make sure he got a better life. In the memoir it says "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." Also, the mood is loving because the author talks about how grateful he is. He's grateful to how much his parents did so much for him and others. In the story it says "I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home." @CAPS2 are ways that explain why this memoirs mood is a loving mood.
1	3	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a combonation of calm, nice, and happy. It could also be described as heavenly.Narciso reffers to his childhood like it was one happy dream. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home". He also mentions how greatful he is to his parents. "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice". One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir, is Narciso's view on family. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship".From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherish this time, and would love to go back.
1	3	4	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration. Rodriguez describes his home @CAPS1 writes, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home" (@NUM1). Rodriguez expresses happiness reminiscing about his home that was "warm." @CAPS2, the mood shows admiration towards his parents. @CAPS1 writes, "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, withot any knowledge of the language or the culture" (@NUM2). Rodriguez admires his parents for coming to @LOCATION1, ready to work hard, despite the problem of knowing nothing about the country. Lastly, the mood can be described as thankfulness, or gratitude. Rodriguez writes, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM3). The house was more than just the physical part; his parents filled it with love and compassion, and Narciso Rodriguez is extremely greatful The overall mood of the passage is greatfulness and happiness
1	3	4	The memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. "It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..." On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. "They struggled both personally and financially" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez."
1	3	4	The main mood through out this entire excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of thanks. Through out the excerpt, @ORGANIZATION1 about and explains about how his parents struggled in the US for their children. In his house, as it is said in paragraph @NUM1, "My young parents created our traditional cuban home" @CAPS1 loved everything about that home. Also his family. Not blood relatives just family. His family was made up of the entire community in a time, as discribed in paragraph @NUM2, "When overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1." @CAPS1 is most thankful of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it discribes "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life... They struggled bothe personally and financially... My parents had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved" His parents gave up everything for his current life and Narciso is forever greatful.
1	3	4	The authors mood of the memoir is that @CAPS1 is grateful because @CAPS1 tells us how much @CAPS1 appreciates of what his parents have done. @CAPS1 appreciates that his parents "immigrated" to the United States so @CAPS1 can have a "better life". @CAPS1 said that "they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved." @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents did that for him. @CAPS1 is happy that his parents made their house like if they were in Cuba where they originally came from. @CAPS1 said that the "Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love." @CAPS1 is thankful of the "sacrifice" that his parents needed to make. @CAPS1 is so grateful that @CAPS1 can't "express his gratitude". The author thanks his parents of what they've done to make him happy. That is how grateful the author is towards what his parents did to make them have a better life and @CAPS1 has learned what the word "family" truly means.
1	3	4	The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful.
1	3	4	The author creates a proud mood in the memoir. The author gives information about his background and how his parents were proud of it. Paragraph two states "I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." Narciso's parents tired to influence as much as their Cuban heritage as they could. Narciso parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states "My parents always kept their arms open and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Though his parents didn't seem to have much money, they still housed others until they got back on their feet. Narciso parents worked hard knowing that they wouldn't get what they deserved. Paragraph five states "The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved." His parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away. In conclusion, the author makes the reader feel praud for what Narciso's parents have done.
1	3	4	The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the @NUM2 sentence the author states "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." This @CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph @NUM3 In the first @NUM4 sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with carage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents.
1	3	4	The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; "I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship." This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; "Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home." This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader.
1	3	4	The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says "I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says "It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love." Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love.
1	3	4	Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, "home", and comfort. He recalls growing up in an apartment where "countless extended family members came and went" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends. Narciso recalls that his parents "always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family" -- and there is a sense of belonging. Comfort: "the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."There's also a sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba -- and as he says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." And this -- all of this -- creates the sense of "home".
1	3	4	In this memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez enstills a kind of loving mood and a strong feeling of gratitude. He is thankful for the fact that his parents sacrificed their happiness and family for the well-being of their child's (Narciso's) life, as shown in paragraph @NUM1, where it says: "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." Also, Narciso gives a feeling of admiration for his parents. He admires their courage for leaving all the wonderful stuff in Cuba, as he says in paragraph @NUM2: "I've often told them [his parents] of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."All in all, Narciso really shows a feeling of love in this memoir.
1	3	4	In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, "In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find." @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his "family". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents "turned the simple house into a home." This is what the tone of this memoir is.
1	3	4	In this memoir the mood created by the author is gratefulness, happiness and unity. This is noticeable in many different ways such as when Narciso says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows gratefulness Narciso per trays to his parents for giving up their life in Cuba. Another example of mood in this memoir is when Narciso states "Here in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations...." This passage shows happiness in Narciso's home. It is evident by the tone used by the author that these were happy times. Lastly when Narciso says, "In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together." This shows unity in the story despite the different races of people who lived around Narciso. This is how happiness, gratefulness, and unity created a mood in this memoir.
1	3	4	In this memoir the author tried to create a mood, so the reader could understand this memoir better. The mood the author created was very caring. The author talks about her "Traditional Cuban Home" he talks about the things that went on in her household, @CAPS1 For @CAPS2 the Passionate Cuban Music that was played, the armonos of the Kitchen, the innocence of childhood, and her life in her "warm home." This shows that her family really loved and cared for one another. Also, Narciso Rodriguez said "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." This also shows the mood was love, and caring for each other. Lastly, Narciso Rodriguez talks about how grateful she is for what her parents did and sacrificed for her. She said she will never forget her graceful Neighborhood, she learned the real definition of family, and she was @CAPS3 her parents/family for turning her house into a home. The mood for this story was very loving, and caring.
1	3	4	In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying "In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of "family."

We can tell the author is thankful because, she says that she is thankful that her parents left Cuba for her to have a life in @LOCATION1. In paragraph five he says, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their childern a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." In paragraph six she says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This is another example showing that she is thankful. A third example is also in paragraph six when the author says, "I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly." This is saying that this person is thankful for the sacrifices and that they can not tell they're parents enough. In conclusion, from the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" the mood that we can conclude is given off is that they are thankful for what they're parents have done for them.

1	3	4	In the memoir, "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez, There are various different moods. The main mood is thankful.           In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankfull mood. In paragraph @NUM1, there is an example of this thankfullness: "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1).    This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done." (paragraph @NUM3). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for what they did for him.      In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thank ful mood.
1	3	4	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he speaks of how his family, related or not, provided the happiness and wonderful memories of his childhood that he adored so much. The overall feel to the memoir, or its mood, was expressed as gracious and thankful to his family, but also warm and happy, creating pictures in the reader's mind of a lovely childhood. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" said Rodriguez, showing his thanks to his parents for allowing him to grow up in @LOCATION1. He knew that many immigrants risked everything to come raise their children in @LOCATION1 and for that he is thankful. He also praises the other families of different cultures in his neighborhood, giving more of a grateful atmosphere to the memoir. "It was a close-knit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people in need." The mood of the memoir is happy and warm as Rodriguez describes his cozy home filled with music, sweet smells, and letting people. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home." Rodriguez's mood and feeling is clearly expressed in his descriptions and memories.
1	3	4	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez had created a very warm and loved mood. He explained a little about his parents when the first came here to @LOCATION1. Narciso also tells us that in 1961 his home was a traditional cuban home. He explains his parents culinary skills, and how he was grateful to have gotten them. Also how there was always music that was like an endless celebration. His parents "always kept their arms and their doors open" (@NUM1) to many of whom they considered family. They had know that if they needed help they would do the same. Later in the memoir Narciso gets to a personal feelings of grateitude, and love. He explains how his parents wanted a better life for their family, even though it meant leaveing so much behind. Their families, friends, and jobs in the country they loved. It takes great bravery. Narciso understands this and expresses it freely.
1	3	4	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood author created is thankfulness and gratefulness towards Narciso's parents, family, and friends for making his house a home and also gratefulness toward just his parents because they gave him a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 it says "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage. without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." @CAPS1 saying this Narciso is expressing thanks and graditude toward his parents. In the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2 it says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." Narciso is clearly stating his gratefulness toward his parents. In the last sentence of the memoir it says "I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house while home." @CAPS2 Narciso is thinking his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it says "It was here I learned them real definition of family." @CAPS3 it weren't for Narciso's parents, friends, family, and home, Narciso wouldn't have learned the real definition of "family." The mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez gratitude.
1	3	4	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designers life. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states "My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..." The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Nex it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. For example he States "Growing up in this new instilled in me a great "Family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our nieborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a tim when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States." @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says "... I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many thing or I learned there about how to love." In conclusion this is how the mood creates the author.
1	3	4	In the excerpt "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of how much friendlyness is given by Narciso Rodriguez neighborhood at his younge age' In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and frienship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Also this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to familys of friends who need a push or help to stand on their feet once again. "countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone stying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..." (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Rodriguez leaes a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love. "I will always be greater to my parents for their love and sacrifize... Admiration for their strength and perseverance.. and these teachings have been the basic of my life. Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents.
1	3	4	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. "Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..." (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. "I've thanked them repeatedly." (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful "will never forget..." something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness.
1	3	4	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" he/she incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about some things. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses." In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this home of the their's. Narciso puts a great deal of love and thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. "It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir, these two are also the ones filled with the most passion and meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", the mood Narciso puts in it is love and passion. 
1	3	4	In  "Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood. I think this is the mood of exceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says "It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country"... This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us." This is another example of how loves and accepting the home that Rodriguez grew up in. It also shows how close, kind, and loving this community was in "@PERSON2" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1.
1	3	4	Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, "Growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative." Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. @CAPS1 acknowledges the troubles @CAPS1 and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, @CAPS1 learned how to appreciate this "close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants."@CAPS1 understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ORGANIZATION2 struggled personally and financially. @CAPS1 became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. @CAPS1 adores them. The author writes, "They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life." Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. @CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. @CAPS1 had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds @CAPS1 created with his parents and the refugees amongst them.
1	3	2	When I read "Narciso Rodriguez" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful. "family had nothing to do with being blood related" I thought that was welcoming and  showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in. He would always thank his parents, because they had left cuba so that their children could have a better life. His parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them.
1	3	2	This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says "But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are." This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull.
1	3	2	This article @PERSON1 has created a different mood for me. I was first bored  but now I'm more grateful of my parents. My parents had also moved from a different country to the United States. They moved from @LOCATION2 to here @CAPS1 the children could have a better life and education. This article also says that close friends can also be family and now that I think about it, I think it's true. The author says "growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives. That's the kind of mood this author created for me as I read this memoir.
1	3	2	There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. This mood is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating "there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1.
1	3	2	The moods created by the author in the @CAPS2 were grate ful because of all the things that the parents did for their child. Friendly because they have "family" in the United states, and they Kept their arms, and door open for their "family". Also they had Courage because they didn't give, trying to learn the language, and finding a job. The last @CAPS1 that this @CAPS2 had was from paragraph seven, happiness, the chid has many memories of his/her Cuban heritage, Still listens to Cuban music, and was born and raised in the united states.
1	3	2	The mood the author creates inthe memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso @CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is @CAPS2 but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a @CAPS2 mood because he explains about his familys troubles and his friends and local neighbors. Narcisco explains what they went through, Which makes a person feel @CAPS4. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say, People came from all over "Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants" would come to this one city, they would unite and help one another. They would also consider each other one big family, which consists of happy and loving. Those are the moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates in the memoir.
1	3	2	The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that "my parents turned this simple house into a home." This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy.
1	3	2	The mood that the @CAPS2 used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times. The @CAPS2 was able to paint a marviles painting of his parents, by using words such as brave, courageous, strength, perseverance, loving, carrieing, and gracious this shows the reader that the @CAPS2 wants to paint a serious mood. Also when the @CAPS2 went on to describe his home it gave a sence of loving and joyful enviroment or mood. For example the @CAPS2 was able to experince real friendship, and endless celebrations, love and the strength of helping others, @CAPS1 his childhood. The @CAPS2 used a powerful since of mood to show his pashen for his parents and his home.
1	3	2	The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you.
1	3	2	The mood set by the author is thankful. The author says that he is happy to have his parents. He thanks them for giving him a life in @LOCATION1, but still carrying out their Cuban ways. He was happy to have others come into his apartment and sit down and act like family. He likes that his parents are selfless and that they care about others. He also enjoyed learning to cook, which he says he adores it to this day.
1	3	2	The mood of the memoir is one of greatfulness and of @CAPS1. This is because the auothor, Narciso Rodriguez says, "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." In this quote is saying straigh up how he feels, which is grateful. You can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents. Another quote that supports my main idea is The author says, "... There is no way to express my gratitude..." In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful. In conlcusion the author uses effective techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is greatful and @CAPS1.
1	3	2	The mood of the author is a very gental yet very happy tone. The reason it's gental is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the sceen just right. For example, "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."     @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today." The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies.
1	3	2	The mood in this story is very happy. In this answer I will show how he created it.Firstly, the author always had a good mood no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. He had great memories of the kitchen smelling good. He also loved his Cuban music.Secondly, he showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and caring for them.These two things show how Narciso Rodriguez made this a happy passage to read.
1	3	2	The mood in this memoir was very happy and grateful to be living in the house where Narciso had such good neighbors as family, who were close to him. Even though Narciso's neighbors weren't actually family (as in blood related) Narciso still felt comfortable with them as if they really were his family. "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." @CAPS1 on their street the immagrents were like a family. They all carried for each other and were happy.
1	3	2	The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of "family" while living in that house. By "family" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful.
1	3	2	The mood in this memoir is very moving and heart-felt. By the way the author writes about his family @CAPS1 can just feel the warmth and love that his family provided for him "... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today." @CAPS1 can just tell by this quote how much of an impact Narciso Rodriguez's parents had on his life. It also explains how crafted his parents were and how intelligent they were. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @PERSON2 most deffinatly loved his family. 
1	3	2	The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative." What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love.
1	3	2	The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family.
1	3	2	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir.
1	3	2	The mood in the memoir "Narciso @CAPS1" is a Open happy familly because her parents worked and made a wonderful home for her. I think the mood in the story is a open happy family becase in the text it says "Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being blood related" and that @CAPS3 that when @CAPS2 was growing up her family had a bunch of people that were considered family but not blood related. Also the text said "It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." That just @CAPS3 that her parants let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their familly, or anybody who was lonley just have some company from them.
1	3	2	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.
1	3	2	The mood created in this memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is a magnificent mood. A family move to the United States from Cuba so there @CAPS1 could have a better education. They have a nice home nice friends and a good and caring family. The neighbor, landlord, or friend Alegria makes them dinner some times. Also, they have friends that go over for dinner and often bring some food over with them. They have a family/friends that were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people. They always had there door open for friend and family and most of there friend would go over every night. They would let people stay at there house if they needed help or if they had to rest. The mood was magnificent in this story.
1	3	2	The mood created in the memoir is grateful. "My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. "I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude Narciso Rodriguez, the author is grateful for the way his cuban parents brought him up when they had so little to begin with @CAPS1 thing that the author is grateful for are the cuban traditions that his family passed on to him. One of the traditions would be there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. @CAPS1 thing the author is grateful for is that his mother and father came to this country to give him a better life even though it meant leaving behind, family, friends, careers and the country they loved That was the mood created by the author in this memoir.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir. First, the mood created by the author is that he love to cook, his parents taugh him how and her is eternally gratefull for his parents. Second, his mother and father "had come to @LOCATION1 with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came to give a better life to Narciso @PERSON1, leaving behind their country they loved."third, he parents had a simple house. They always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.In summary, this are the mood created by the author.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his "real" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is the begining of the memoir he tells how his parents had a hard time coming to another country and having to deal with allot of problem and the mood is really sad or with allot of suspense and by the middle of the memoir he talks about how he grown up in a family that everbody was so happy and live most everbody together and they had allots of feast and that mood changed to a more happy mood or joyfull mood that he had with his family, and by the end he talks about he thank his parents for the person that he is and all the opportunities they give him and that change the mood to a thankful mood or a grateful mood. And that is how the author creates all the moods on the memoir.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. He seems happy because, he talks about his parents, his family, and his home which make him happy. In paragraph @NUM1, the author talks about how being blood-related doesn't have to do with family. In paragraph  two, the author talks about the simple house that his parents made a home. When you read paragraph  two, and how he describes the home, the author makes you feel happy. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says how he will always be grateful for his parents and the life that they gave him. That is the mood and some examples created by the author in the memoir.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness Here are my three reasons why I think that First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is. It all began, starting with his parents, they are immagrants. "In 1961, I was born into this simple house."@CAPS1 of all, @CAPS2 cherished every moment @CAPS2 lived. @CAPS2 is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. "my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family".Finally, His parents migrated from cuba. They are known as immagrents because they was not born in america, and narciso is proud and honestly happy for them. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful to have the rich culinary skills and a love for cooking just like his Parents. His very happy he came from such friendly family. The community and @ORGANIZATION1 comes together to help out those who needs a hand. Rodriguez is grateful to his Parents for their love and sacrifice, and he thanks them repeatedly. His Parents have there arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a nice "homie" feeling. The author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls it is a place for relationships are made. "The congregation of family and friends." The is is signifagant because all of the good times an celebrations occurred with the people he loved in his home. The author tries to show the love and affection throughout his home. "always filled the air with not just sent in music but life and love." The author shows the love that goes on throughout his home.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him. Making his house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friend ships and familys, but family being the relation ships between their friends even if they werent blood realitives. Overall he thanked his parents and said "in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, paragraph four. Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music. Every One has such a great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood.
1	3	2	The mood created by the author in "Narciso Rodriguez"is very calm and happy. The author This very calm and cool. There are no loud or emphasized parts. It is also very happy. It describes a family growing and getting to love each other. Also frends and more family having happy times having celebrations. The happiest line was the last, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple little house into a home." It also has a very loving tone to it. Anything about a family coming together is loving.
1	3	2	The mood created by the @PERSON1 in the memoir was to show how happy it was for Narciso Rodriguez growing up. "here, The innocence of childhood, The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home" and when the @PERSON1 says "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relitive." as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good Childhood
1	3	2	The mood Created by the author brought out a Cuban @CAPS1 of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't mean "blood relatives" it is People who need help and will have that Same felling for @CAPS2 if @CAPS2 needes that same help. The mood @CAPS3 how @CAPS2 have to go threw alot of times where it's hard and @CAPS2 will lament but @CAPS2 have to get through it and it will pay off. your culture is a part of the mood of the story. This @CAPS4's @CAPS5's came from cuba and had a one bedroom apartment raises a kid and still helped others. The apartment is turned into a cubain house hold of food and music and families. The mood elavtes and esksimtes as they spend more time more family better living space better job and most of all better under standing. The mood of the whole story really cenies around family and the true meaning of family. family is your love ones who care and help, love and respect @CAPS2, That's the mood of the story.
1	3	2	The memoir has a very happy mood to it. Paragraph @NUM1 gives a real feeling for what the authors home was like. It talks about the food and the music that the author emphasises his love for. Paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 give information on how close the comunity was. The author talks about how great his friend Alegria was and says she "graced" their kitchen. Throughout the memoir, the author explains how happy his home was and with his detailed descriptions the reader gets a feel for the happiness too.
1	3	2	The book Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the memoir describes of her home and how grateful she was towards it. The author was gratefu her parents work toward the house because of how much time the parents had used in order to make the auther at her homeland. The declorations in the home were amazingly done to perfection. "My young parents creates our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen" (paragraph @NUM1). Shows how much love, time, sacerfice her parent put through to achieve such amazment. It is hard in order to turn "one simple house into a home." (paragraph @NUM2).
1	3	2	The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about on how that he is so grateful that his parents were so caring and selfless people because they moved from their home country cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen. The memoir he left was definetly a pausitive one not a negative one.
1	3	2	The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) "The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times." This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."
1	3	2	The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was greatful mood. In the memoir it states "skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)" This quote make me feel grateful for my culture and heritage. This story also make me feel proud. In the story it states "My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage". I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life. Lastly the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he pround of his parents and culture.
1	3	2	In this memoir," @PERSON1, he is feeling loving when he wrote this. One @CAPS1 is when he says, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give there children a better life..." is showing an @CAPS1 of love. Also, when he says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Last @CAPS1 is when he said, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. In this memoir, you can tell @PERSON1 really cares about his family, especially his loving parents.
1	3	2	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way.
1	3	2	In this memoir there are many different moods that the auther tells you about. Happiness is a mood that the author tells you about. They are all happy because they can be together and have a grate time. Another mood is careing. her parents care about others and keep there doors open For them at all times. Love. Love is all around this house. They love all their Friends and Family and celebrate with then no matter what. They also show there love by leting people stay with them untill they can get back up onto there Feet. One mood in this memoir is courage, these two people show courage when they get here and they keep that Courage for a very long time. Expeshaly when they come from having such grate jobs to ones that arnt that great.
1	3	2	In this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the Same throughout the memoir. The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. One way that this mood was @CAPS1 was that they talked how their enviorment Showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. "It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need". This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood.
1	3	2	In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a "simple house" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of "twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria" or about "Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)." When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel "at home", which is the topic of the memoir.
1	3	2	In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefullness. I know this because in the memoir it says, "But, in reality, theres is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)." The way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful.
1	3	2	In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home. Like when he talks about the hart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in paragraph @NUM1. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood. Like in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future.
1	3	2	In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.
1	3	2	In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a "blood" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!
1	3	2	In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the author in the memoir. The mood was like excited because Narciso Rodriguez is man that we can tell that he is a man that apreciate what his family did for him. Because in the memoir say that he felt graceful and happy about his culture. He is from cuba, his family are so friendship. His family teach him lots of stuff that why now is have been the basis of his life. His friend have inportant friends. Now in this memoir he express all and also how proud he felt about his family. And his admiration about his family is awsome. he learned with his family how to love others and how to respect. In the memoir he say that he would never forget how his parent turned his simple house into a home. This is how the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the author in the memoir.
1	3	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love
1	3	2	In This memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives The @CAPS3 explains the definition family as not blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they had on you and the role played by them in your life portraying a figure of some sort in your eyes As the @CAPS3 descriptively went through this the whole time @CAPS5 was talking about family and the definition of it they were not portrayed as people related to you but just basically people who were their for you the one who gave the shoulder to cry on as in the memoir the land lord and his daughter had put food on the table for the @CAPS6 more often than not and How the whole community had been a family because they acted as one reaching out to lend a hand though they had come from very different backgrounds some more different from each other stood unified resulting in something more they were a family
1	3	2	I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone. Rodriguez says "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family." They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them.
1	3	2	I believe the was more of a "thank you" in the memoir and here a three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. Like in the excerpt "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents because he was praising them. In the excerpt "I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done." @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents. Like in the excerpt "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." These are the three ways the mood was more of a "thank you" kind of thing in the memoir.
1	3	2	Based on the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood could be a lot of things. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood. first of all I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said "... and for wich I am eternally grateful." also it said "wich I adore to this Day." How I know that those where a @CAPS2 moode because if I where to say that it be @CAPS2, also there was nothing saying that @CAPS1 disliked it. Second of all, @CAPS1 would all ways tell his Parents that "I will always be grateful to my Parents fo thier love and sacrifice." also told them "I've often told them of admiration for their strenth and Perseverance. There for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a @CAPS2 mood that the author created.
1	3	2	All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it "our traditional Cuban home" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love.
1	2	3	When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. The overall mood of Narciso's story is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. His memoir explains how @CAPS1 is grateful for everything. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance. His family cared for everybody and "Always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." All and All the memoir's mood is gratefulness because Narciso was very grateful for everything.
1	2	3	Througout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt with their struggles they had overcame and heritage they were proud of. Paragraph @NUM1 illustrates the fond memories Narciso has of his house and childhood. Paragraph @NUM2 displays Narciso's strong sense of family within his local @CAPS1 community. Paragraph @NUM3 explains Narciso's parents' rough journey from Cuba to @LOCATION1, and paragraph @NUM4, Narciso explains how grateful he is for his parents' hard work and determination for their children to have a good life. "It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love" wraps up the whole article and shows how grateful and cared for Narciso feels for his warm, welcoming home celebrating life, love, and their Cuban culture.
1	2	3	Throughout this @CAPS1 there is a very happy and loving vibe. This is shown in paragraph @NUM1, "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in a warm home. This paints a glorious picture of what @CAPS2 life in the house was like. Another example in the text is at the end, in paragraph @NUM2, "I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home." This shows with happiness and love, It does not matter how rich you are, or what you own. Anything can be a home.
1	2	3	Throughout the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates many different moods. As a ready I got a large variaty of moods from the author. Such as sorrow for the family and what they went through, pitty for the children and how they watched their parents struggle for them, yet at the same time they benefited from watching because it made them stronger. Though throughout the memoir, among all the of the other moods that are potraid, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much just for their kids to have a better times and a promising future is beyond the relm of words. Words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did. This is the mood, and moods, that are potraid in this memoir.
1	2	3	Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became" family" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son.
1	2	3	There are many ways to describe the mood in "Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly. This is because in paragraph @NUM1, the author states "the innocence of child hood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home." Also, the mood is very joy ful. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states, "all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS2, the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." These have been some moods in this story.
1	2	3	There are many moods that the author creates in the story, "Narciso Rodriguez", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creats are sad, brave, and thankfull. The author creats a sad mood in many ways. One way he creats a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how imigrants leave their families, friends and carrer, just to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and to lead your children in a good place. In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life. The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to @LOCATION1. He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things.
1	2	3	The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1 he says "It was here where I learned the real definition of "family". And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness.
1	2	3	The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful. @CAPS1 is for living in @LOCATION1, and that even though @CAPS1 didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. @CAPS1 loves and appreciates what her family did for her. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. @CAPS1 will never forget the house because it is where @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family. "It is where I learned the real definition of "family." And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. 
1	2	3	The mood of the memoir was warm and happy. The author talks about how is parents were poor and just moved to the United States from Cuba. He then says he had a wonderful life even though his family didn't have a lot of money. All that mattered was that they had their family and friends around them every day. Narciso says how his parents gave him the love and skill to cook and how he still has that love and his love for Cuban music. This memoir basically says how Narciso's parents were people who realized the more important things in life. It's not all about the fame and fortune. Its about love and family and spending time together.
1	2	3	The mood of the memoir is that he is growing up in the house with his Mother and father. His parents giving a hand to people who Need help. One explaination is when his parents moved here and left all of their friends & family in hopes to make a better life for him. Another is showing him about his culture threw music, cooking, celebrations and taking care of other people. His parents let people stay at their home when they Need to get on their feet. And by always having people over for dinner (Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, @CAPS1 etc...).
1	2	3	The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. "In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."
1	2	3	The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrant to the @LOCATION1 Also its @CAPS1 as sad, "... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved", another mood would be brave. For me these immigraters are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is greatful. "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." In conclution, these are many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2.

In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood "cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship" And how "immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand." The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that "family" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart.
1	2	3	The mood in the memoir is very happy.

Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice.

The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough time. "all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."      The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close is friends and family were. It is a mood that helps readers understand Narciso's community.

"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how "They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships." @CAPS1 he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again.
1	2	3	The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and charising the memorys he had of his old home.

1	2	3	Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better, it was as if I was there with him. I can see he really remembers the sound, shites, and smells of his home. "...situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." That whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities. Therefore the mood is happy and warm, I would love to be there.
1	2	3	In this memoir the author gives the mood a sense of inspiration, as well as the love of family and friends. In the memoir the author talks about how great it is that the author's parents had turned a simple ordinary house into a home, which means that the author's parents had made thier house to feel like home by bringing their Cuban culture into the house, such as Cuban food, Cuban music, and Cuban decoration. That makes the memoir a happy mood. But there is also inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are, family is family, people who love and care about you the most.
1	2	3	In this memoir the author creats a mood of grattitude. To support a claim like this I will provide evidence. It says in the article that "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This clearly shows how the author is trying to creat a mood of gratitude. His gratitude is being showed towards his parents. Also it says that They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life.

Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming "... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative." @CAPS2 always had neibors an friends over which @CAPS2 considered to be "family." The was alot of love in his neibors, and so @CAPS2 grew up with a lot of love around him. But, of course, @CAPS2 loves his parents the most.In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throuout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood @CAPS2 had, living in a great loving neiborhood, with parents that love him alot.Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did.
1	2	3	In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez, The mood the author created was loved, because he showed that his parents gave up  what they had from Cuba to come to @LOCATION1 for a better for their children. For example his @CAPS1 worked in a labortory in cuba, and his mom was studying chemical @CAPS2 and they left that to live in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1. And the author discribed how he grew up in a triditional Cuban home and how you could smell the aroma of food, and Passionate Cuban music filled the air. And how he lived in a neighborhood of Spanish, @CAPS3, and Italian Immigrants. And he also discribed how his family always kept their doors open for people who were considered family.
1	2	3	In this memoir "Narciso Rodriguez", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they "always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family." In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir.
1	2	3	In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 creats a mood, here is the mood created. The first mood is the one of her house. She describes friends and family with cuban music along with the food here is one example of the food and music "Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Another mood is the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family." And those are some reasons how the @CAPS1 set a mood in The Blueprints of our lives.
1	2	3	In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity.
1	2	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author's mood was happiness. He explains that he is greatful for his parents for her home, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author also shows that she was taught how to do things by her parents, and that she was happy that they did that. He thinks that family and friends are important too. For these reasons, the author created the mood of happiness in his memoir.
1	2	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. "passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cookig that is still with me today." (par @NUM1). He decribes his parents cooking skills as "rich" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. "all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship." (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, "always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love." (par. @NUM3). You can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses. This is how the author creates the mood in the story.
1	2	3	In the memoir, @PERSON1 by @PERSON2 the mood he created was being grateful.The mood the author @PERSON1 had in the memoir was grateful.

On paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says "I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love." Narciso's mood he's being grateful about the unity he had at the place he called Home. With many diverse immigrants mostly Spanish, Cuban and a few Italian people.In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful about the oppurtunities that was left for him. Now he's a international clothing designer. He will never forget the days he had in the traditional Cuban Home.
1	2	3	In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of "family". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative", meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family.
1	2	3	In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" from "Home: The Blueprints of our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." That shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls at home, because a home is a place for someone fells safe and comfortable.
1	2	3	In the memoir the mood that was created by the @CAPS1 was saying Family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise. That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The @CAPS1 is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money no job but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a @NUM1 room house with their family. With out family life would be much harder to deal with.
1	2	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. @CAPS1 tells how his parents "always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family." Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 "will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them. Lastly @CAPS1 @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 "will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad.
1	2	3	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir are described in many ways. To start of with, "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative." Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2've often told them that they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS2 could have ever done. Finally, It was here where @CAPS2 learned the real definition of "family". @CAPS2 will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood and @CAPS2 will never forget how his parent turned this simple house to a home. In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez", from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir where discribe in these ways.
1	2	3	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez the author create the mood of familarty and homyness.First, in the memoir Narciso describes his home enough to give the reader a sense of homyness. There are many examples of this in the memoire. One is when Narciso Rodriguez says "the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home." When Narciso writes this it creates a sense of home or homyness. This is one of the many moods Narciso makes you feel in the passageSeconde, Narciso also creates a mood of, famileraty to a lot of people. Espesically immigrents, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life." This is something all immigrants and sons of immigrents know of. So Narciso creats a mood of familerty with this memoir.Finally, in the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, their is a mood of homyness and famlierty.
1	2	3	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family." this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally.
1	2	3	In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. "Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author.
1	2	3	In the excerpt by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of his home is created. The mood in his home is always happy, and thankful. Narciso was always talking posetive, never about what is bad in his life. He talks about how his parents had to start over again with their lives to come to @LOCATION1. "meant leaving behind their familles, friends, and careers...". This quote meants that his parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1. Narciso and his family have lots of friends like them because they keep there arms open to people. Narciso's mood is set in the excerpt from his memoirs.
1	2	3	In "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, many moods were shown and created in the memoir. One mood shown in the memoir is great love. In paragraph three, Narciso wrote, "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS1 mood described in Narciso's memoir was gratitude. In the final paragraph, the author wrote, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." A last mood produced in the memoir was pride. In paragraph two, Narciso wrote, "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Many positive emotions were created by Narciso Rodriguez in his great family memoir.
1	2	3	In "@PERSON1" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as "aromas," "endless," "encompassed," "instilled," etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like "(and for which I am eternaly grateful)" and "(which I adore to this day)" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating "I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice." The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of "@PERSON1" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of "@PERSON1" as being very passionite and full of gratitude.
1	2	3	I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." In many paragraphs he explains how he admires them for their strength and perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable. "Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations." This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid. (growing up in that household.) This is why I think the mood is so grateful and happy.
1	2	3	Home and family is the @CAPS1 one thing all of us love. The mood the author created was heartwarming and appreciation, because he explains how comftable his home is with everyone, together having a good time. Not only Just being together but being together: "Growing up in this enviroment instilled in him a great sense that "familly" nothing to do with being a Blood relative."Narciso Rodriguez show his appreciation for his parents he loved so much because they had to make an important change to give him a better life wiched he deseverd. They had made this change "even though it meant leaving behind their families." Such bravery they had.The author left us knowing his appreciation for his "home" with being grateful for his parents and his hispanic heritage.
1	2	3	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.
1	2	1	the mood created by the author in the memoir was mutule in the begining it was about move to a New contrey they did seem faced by it they were more into giveing there child a better life and in the end it really sounds like they were all happy they welcomed people that moved from somwhere els into there home and welcomed them I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author
1	2	1	the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy for remember the most important peoples on his life, the poor house were he lives when he had his first birthday and a different kind of people in the place were his family live, he was grateful for everything to his parents gived to him when he was a little boy and the education how his parents give it to him.
1	2	1	on paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say's "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done." I think that the mood the auther is creating in the memoir is happyness because Narciso is very geatful to his parents.
1	2	1	Though out this story there is a certain @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. like how these people got there dream home and this was it. How there Parents Came to this country not knowing the language or have a good edication but Still becoming succesful and living in this house. Where these people learned to love. and the best part having family near by.
1	2	1	The moode the author has in this memoir is happines. He states that growing up around in the envirnorment gave him a sence of family, he says that here in my house felt lik cuba. He and his whole family have respected each other and others. Thats the authors mood
1	2	1	The mood was to show it was a comftorble feeling. To show about a family and how a family would take care for you and what not to explain what lifestyle makes someone feel great to make the feel safe and not live in a life where it will just wither away from you. That is the mood I think the author is trying to set
1	2	1	The mood to me was love and to getherness. Every one in the community would help each other one out. In the passage they said "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not neciraraly not there own kind, were clearly in need." That tells me they will help and love anyone and any race like they were part of there own family. That is the mood this story portraise to me.

Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love.

The author further emphasizes the mood by using words like aromas, passionate. The author sets a calm, kind and gentle mood by talking about family and friends. In conclusion the author sets a calm and kind mood by using words and subject matter that I feel are calming.
1	2	1	The mood created by the author in the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez," was sort of excitement/happiness. In the memoir of the author states that "Rawedia Maria and Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home." The author is excited and happy to move from Cuba, to have a chance to grow up in the United States.

The reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2.

Intence because because is hard to move on. Lastly Strong because he was strong inoff to leave that behind even though it was hard.
1	2	1	The author of the memoiar was writing about a boy who grew up in @LOCATION1 and loved his first home. the @CAPS1 of this story is that happiness can be created and kept in one place. The boy in the story was very happy about how his parents took care of him and gave him a safe enviroment to grow up in he said that home is were @CAPS2 feel geruenly happy and want to stay there the rest of your life.
1	2	1	The author creates an optimistic, caring mood in his memoir. He described the strong sence of love and kenship in hs home. These emotions came out in the writing. The passage-being about his home-sent out a very homey vibe. One can feel the warmth, love, and roots in this memoir. The loving mood of this excerpt has many subdivisions of emotions.
1	2	1	The author creates a simple but peacful and happy mood with the way he describes things. in paragraph @NUM1 he describes his home growing up in great @CAPS1 that makes it feel almost like you are there. also words he used to describe the neiborhood like hardworking, and close knit, help set the mood for the story. It makes you think of your own family.
1	2	1	The author created many different moods in this memoir. An obvious one is Love. As a child @CAPS1 really appreciated that her parent gat anew home and moved to @LOCATION1 to raise their child. @CAPS1 loved her cuban background and environ ment that @CAPS1 grew up in.
1	2	1	The @CAPS1 is writing in first person narrative. The @CAPS2 sets a tone with and about How he is so proud of his cuban relationship and haritage. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very very fund memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave cuba and come to america. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story.
1	2	1	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir was regular becacuse in the story (Narciso Rodriguez) he explains his life a little to the reader he explains how they lived in cuba then to america and the boy also explains how he loves his home, and celebration and heritage in america the boy talks with  like same kind of smat tone beacse he's really explaining his like then about really now and hear he likes is so theres no anger in this story.

1	2	1	In the storie "Narciso Rodriguez" I think the author was very greatful & happy at the moment. I think he was happy, because he was lathing about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved how to cook in the kitchen with everyone. Also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family.
1	2	1	In the passage the author provided a good mood. for example he talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related things. He talked about the differences of a home and house. He made this passage for people to start thinking about what love realy is and what people will realy do for each other. He is a very good author.
1	2	1	In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close.
1	2	1	In the memoir there is more the one mood, but this is the main one. First, the author is trying to create a "no place like home mood," and the author succeeds at it. It seems he/she is using memory and telling his/her background. The mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story. In conclusion this is the mood the author is giving.
1	2	1	In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family.
1	2	1	In the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir. He also speak of cherished childhood memorys and how good his cummunity was and parents.
1	2	1	In the memoir the author Narciso Rodriguez set a good mood. One thing he did was compare the United States and Cuba. He also made the kids parents seem like very nice people which set a friendly mood. Another thing he did we show how much the kids thanked his parents for making a sacrafice for him. Overall I think Narciso made this story a very cheerful story.
1	2	1	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" (who is also the author) is writing about his live changing experience. The mood of the poem is happy. His parents immagrated from Cuba to the United States in 1956. When he was growing up he learned all Cuban traditions and envied them all. He's very proud of his parents for the risk that they took for him. This is why the mood of the story is happy.
1	2	1	In the author's memoir the author creats a mood and that mood in the story as happyness anjoy. It is happyness and @CAPS1 becuse he was happy for his home and how his parents were cooks. He also joyed the music and things he does with his family and relitize. I think this is the mood the author used in the memoir.
1	2	1	IN THE MEMOIR HOME: THE BLUEPRINTS OF OUR LIVES. HER MOOD IS LOVE, BECAUSE SHE LOVES HER PARENTS FOR ALL THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE, JUST SO NARCISCO CAN HAVE A BETTER LIFE FOR EXAMPLE, "I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO MY PARENTS FOR THEIR LOVE AND SACRIFICE." SHE MEANS SHE WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT HER PARENTS DONE FOR HER IN HER CHILDHOOD TO MAKE HER BECOME WHAT SHE IS NOW. ANOTHER EXAMPLE, "I WILL NEVER FORGET HOW MY PARENTS TURNED THIS SIMPLE HOUSE INTO A HOME." SHE MEANS THAT HER PARENTS SACRIFICED TO TURN A @NUM1 ROOM APARTMENT INTO HER HOME.
1	2	1	I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage. And learn about all the cooking. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seens very grateful.
1	2	1	I think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood. He talks about how thankful he is to have such a good family and that he can call his home a home. I think that when readers read this memoir will make them think how thankful they should be with being blessed with people that love them and having eachother. I just think the memoir sets a happy mood.
1	2	1	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from.
1	2	1	I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that "... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."
1	2	1	He creates a calming outgoing mood for the @CAPS1 he makes The reader feel, smell and hear the cuban, Spanish influence around him in his home. The feeling inside his home is warm and bright the soothing viberant hispanic vibe that run's through the @CAPS1 brings a great feeling to the reader.
1	1	2	the @CAPS1 the author created was a warming @CAPS1. He gave events from the past which created a content tone. He also used discriptive language about the food, Music, and family. in this memoir it stated that he appricieated his parents very much for their selflessness. in @NUM1 it sais "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood @CAPS2". This is showing now nis family treated him real well. All in All he gave a good tone in this story.
1	1	2	the @CAPS1 that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gattr of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, @PERSON1, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet. He had a childhood full of family and friendship. which is great to have.
1	1	2	c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage. 
1	1	2	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that oppertunity, that his parents gave him. I know that @CAPS1 my parents did that for me, I would never forget them.
1	1	2	They were sad through some of this memoir. The first reason why they were sad was that they left there familys. They also had to leave the country of Cuba. And left their friends to. They were also happy too. The reason why is because it is a Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 comunity. So they feel like they are at home.    They were made because they would half to start there life over. They would have to find new jobs and transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
1	1	2	There is o good moud @CAPS1 to this @CAPS2. the mood is a warm, happy feeling. Whenyou read the @CAPS2 it makes you feel @CAPS4. Just like being at your own home. But only a little different. This time youare reading a @CAPS2. It really explains what is going On. It als o give s alot of past information. Which I like in a @CAPS2. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being cuban. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good @CAPS6. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up asa child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But other wise @CAPS7 has a good life.
1	1	2	The mood story the author creates is a prideful memoir of his life/home and what others did for him, while living in a time of hate/racism. He feels foreverly grateful for the love and sacrifice his parents showed to him. He was happy that during these times people of of different culture/ethnicity were treating all in the community like family. The mood and emotion of this memoir is of pride/love for others and caring.
1	1	2	The mood in this paragraph is pride, and hope, and love. Narciso clearly feels very strongly about his family. He states "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." That sentence alone @CAPS1 the pride and @CAPS2 in Narciso's words. The mood is happy and loving.
1	1	2	The mood in the memoir is very adventorous. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved. At first Narciso lived in a furnished one-room apartment, then they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Narciso grew up with his family for a while. "Family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Narciso will always be greatful and loving to his parents for what they did for him.
1	1	2	The mood in "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", by Narciso Rodriguez, is warming and caring. From this memoir you can tell there was a lot of love, understanding, patience, and gratitude in this family. He was greatly affected by his parents selflessness and I'm sure he will be as loving and wonderful to his own family because of what they taught him.
1	1	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life.
1	1	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very luring, like you read one sentence, then you want to read more. In the story, she says how her parent have to start their lives all over again. But, then she says that they're just happy to be together in good old @LOCATION1. Just because you have very little, doesn't mean you can't live it out the fullest. Be happy with what you got or don't have anything at all is what this story is telling me in my mind. So I will follow my life to the best like Narciso and her family did.
1	1	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy because he talks about things that happened to his parents and happy things of his parents. I think the author is sad because they died but he could be happy too. I think I would be sad and happy if my parents died. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy. My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house. I think he was happy where he was born.
1	1	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home reminds him of his old country. The author talks about his grand parents not being able to come to @LOCATION1 until 1970. Narciso's house was turned into a home that reminded him of Cuba.
1	1	2	The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this becacus he did not talk badily about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kit. in paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comsortabur. I know this because he sais. the love of cooking and the passioniate Cuban music.
1	1	2	The @CAPS1 mood about the story is happy. The reason why is because the story talks aboult how the kid learns a lot of things from his young parents. The boy learns that @CAPS3 was born in cuba but @CAPS3 had to leave to New @CAPS2 even though @CAPS3 didn't want to. @CAPS3 also learns that his mom and that like to cook a lot together, @CAPS3 also learns that they make schedules for eachother. Even thougth they moved to New @CAPS2 they still do what they do in cuba and they let people visit even thougth they don't know them.
1	1	2	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @NUM3 different backgrounds on the two different @CAPS3 of People. It talks about how @PERSON1's Parents were imigrants and weren't raised well buts they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter @LOCATION1 , were rich and Could do anything they wanted. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods.
1	1	2	In this memoir the mood created by the author is very positive. The author is turning @CAPS1 not good into a much better thing. Like when they had a very small house they turned it into a home. The people living in this small house let people stay with them until they got back on there feet. These people made up the whole building feel much better by keeping there old culture around.
1	1	2	In the memoir, the author tells us all about his family and friends and his backround. He tells us that the way he grew up effected him all his life. He loved his parents and relatives and friends and his home. He even loved his Cuban heritage. In this entire memoir there is nothing but happiness and good attitude from the author. He lets us know that home is where the heart is and that he would'nt trade his childhood life for anything.
1	1	2	In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez," the author is happy. The author describes his home is a place for family. He is grateful to his parents for everything they did. The author enjoyed his childhood. He was surrounded by loving people and lots of friends. That is how in the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez," the author is happy.
1	1	2	In the memoir the mood was happy and loving because when they had their house their families would be welcomed in and strangers also would be welcome in. His parents were very loving because they were always so kind to people and they would rarely get into arguments. And the family was so enthusiastic and happy just because their family was together
1	1	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir is together the family is organized. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today" the parents really are together thing how to organized the family. That is the mood that is created by the author in the memoir.
1	1	2	In the memoir "@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives." I belive the author Narciso Rodriguez, demostraigted the mood of being laidback very acticulatly.This memoir dose not soud very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthenthese with aditoal statments for exsample in paragraph @NUM1. And taking about his friends and family so openly.Thats why I @PERSON1's memoir "Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives." @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back.
1	1	2	In the memoir "@CAPS1 Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking. First, on page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 Rodriguez wrote, "I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba." Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never meat @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important  because early in the memoir she said @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion,  in the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking, @CAPS2 real grandparents come to @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real deftion of family.
1	1	2	In every paragraph in the memoir he explains how life was and how he loved it so much. In paragraph @NUM1 he uses parenthesis to show or talk about how much he loved different kinds of things. He shows in his writing all the warm kind of feelings he had as a child. In paragraphs three and four he also talks about how much he loved being with other cultures and how his parents were really good people.
1	1	2	A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that "kids have to do a lot of the work" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say "my parents will always be there for me."
1	1	2	@PERSON1's mood was happy and greatful. @PERSON1 was grateful was because he had his family together and his mom and dad were open house with the culture. He was happy because his life was better thae it would have been if they stayed in Cuba. That was @PERSON1's mood.
1	1	0	The mood of the memory is happy and loving.
1	1	0	The authors @CAPS1 was good because the story is kind of happyness.
1	1	0	The author fellt happ she war born in the @CAPS1. S. A. But she loved her cubin haratig.

0	4	4	While reading the memoir titled "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, "My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air...". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." And where it also says, "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship."At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having "Such courage" and how "They came selflessly" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, "I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice." Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child.
0	4	4	What is the mood, created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they can get back on their feet. "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done." The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there. "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life.
0	4	4	Throught the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a mood of happiness and thankfulness towards his parents. Rodriguez writes "…and for which I am eternally grateful" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is expressing his thankfulness to his parents for the wonderful things they have taught him such as cooking. Another way this mood of happiness is portrayed is through his writing about people coming together. He writes "all of these cultures came together showing great solidarity and friendship." (@NUM2). He is happy and thankful for the connections he made with people of different cultures, and ethnicities. Despite the racism going on in the places around them, his parents were able to bring people together by being welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Lastly, he is greatful for all the things the parents sacrificed for him. He writes, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice," (@NUM3). They taught him that money isn't everything and that family and friends are greatly important. They had the ability to impress apon him many qualities that benefited his life. He writes "these teachings have been the basis of my life" (@NUM3). The mood is portrayed as happy and thankful about the lessons his parents taught.
0	4	4	Throughout this memoir a very important mood is portrayed and that is thankfulness. Throughout this memoir Narciso shows great thankfulness towards her parents and how they gave up everything in they country they loved, Cuba in order for their kids to have more opportunities and to have a better life. Also in this memoir it talked about her parents making the best of what they do have and always helping people in their communitie hoping that they would return the favor if needed. In their neighborhood all the races were together in unity despite the customs else where. In @LOCATION1 her parent's struggled both personally and finecially and they had to accept they might not get the jobs they deserve but they did it all for their kids, they had to endure the tough times for the better of their kids. Narciso has thanked his parents repeatedly for their love and sacrifice but in reality he says there is no way to express his gratitude. Narciso said he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home. His parents perseverance is the basis of his life today that taught him great lessons.
0	4	4	Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, he potrays a happy, uplifting, positive mood that explains how close his family was and what being a family means to him. It also describes how grateful he is toward his parents and how proud he is of his Cuban culture.First of all, Narciso believes that to be a family, you don't have to be blood related to that person. In paragraph @NUM1, he says: "… All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close – knit community…" This quote explains how much he valued his friends, neighbors, and other family members; and how all three of these categories formed the house he called home.Secondly, the mood of the memoir was not only centered around family and friends, but Narciso also showed much gratitude toward his parents. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, "They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life…" And the later in paragraph @NUM3. he says, "I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice." These two quotes explain how much he admires his parents, and this feeling of admiration and thanks played large part in the mood of Narciso's memoir.Finally, @PERSON2's Cuban pride was another large contributor in the mood of this excerpt. In paragraph @NUM4, it describes how he adores Cuban music to this day and how his "parents created their traditional Cuban home" @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM5, he says, "… a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love." This quote describes how much he cares about his culture and where his family is from.In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is full with a closely – knit family, gratitude, and pride in his culture. And all three of these things helped make his "house a home."
0	4	4	There are alot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir, The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming.One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, "here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative". And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, "in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, "it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, "they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like its Cuba. In my prospective this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart.
0	4	4	There are a few ways to describe the mood the @CAPS2 created in this memoir. They description im going to give is the @CAPS2 created a very happy & loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1. it say's "Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." That means that family doesnt have to be blood related for you and that person to unite and became very good friends. Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done." That shows she's a very loving and caring person to actually be @CAPS1 for something your parents have done. Those are a few way's to describe how the @CAPS2 created this happy and loving mood.
0	4	4	The overall mood of this excerpt from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 is of love and gratitude. This article shows that @PERSON1 is looking back with love and warm memories in his mind, and there are many examples to show that this is true. @PERSON1 described his home as "(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but with life and love" this shows how loveingly he thought of his home because he talked of how the house was always filled with life and love. He described the people of his neighborhood as "a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..." @PERSON1 describes this community with a lot of affection in this quote, which also conveys a warm mood. @PERSON1 constantly talks of his parents great sacrafices and he is eternally grateful. For example, he says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice." This peice also talks of his friendly home environment where everyone was welcome. He said "My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..." @CAPS1 the mood this article conveyed a feeling of love, warmth, gratitude, happiness and acceptance
0	4	4	The over all mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude. A quote from paragraph @NUM1 is, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This quote shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home and he is very happy and grateful for that.  Another quote is, "I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done." paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life. A quote from paragraph @NUM3 is, "It was here where I learned the real definition of "family". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love." This shows that he is so grateful to his parents for teaching him so much about life, love, and family that he would have never known if it weren't for them.
0	4	4	The mood the author creates in the memoir shows a soothing and grateful memory of the authors home and relatives. The author creates a peaceful tone representing calmness, comfort, and happiness displayed in his memories.One example of the authors way of creating a comfy and peaceful mood is in paragraph @NUM1 "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." @CAPS1 two sentences give a deep and warm thought of family and friends along with comforting images of kitchens and sweet aromas of cooking. This type of writing gives the reader a calm mood based on the comforting words, used in the sentence such as passionate, aromas, innocence, and warmAnother example is in paragraph @NUM2 where the author displays happiness and shows his gratfulness for having family and what his family has done for him. This adds to the mood in the memoir by representing how great family is and how much it can mean to people.Overall the author uses calming and strong words to get his images and feelings through in the memoir. Because of this he was able to create a peaceful, and comfortable mood while expressing his love for family and friends.
0	4	4	The mood the author created in the memoir was appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez thank his parents many times for moving to @LOCATION1 and giving up their lives in Cuba to give him a better life. He also thanks them for his childhood. He thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in. When the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents. He tells how even though his community was made up of many races they still lived in friendship and unity. He tells how people always came over to house for dinner and there were many celebrations. He tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture. He describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives. Narciso describes how his parents had great jobs in Cuba, gave those up, and took any jobs they could find in @LOCATION1. In paragraph six he says how he will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also in that paragraph he says there is no way to express the graditude he feels towards his parents. The last sentence of that paragraph he says "They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life." There once again he is thanking his parents. Throughout the memoir he describes his parents like heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him. That is why the mood for this memoir was appreciation
0	4	4	The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He expresses love, appriciation, and unity. Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture. He stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around cuban food and music. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says, "...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today," and, "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." @CAPS1 he showed appritation toard his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery by coming to @LOCATION1. He talks alot about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph @NUM2. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all cuban, spanish, or Italian imagrents, and they tended to stick together. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word "family" means.
0	4	4	The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, "all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as "family" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that "...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, "... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..." This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind.
0	4	4	The mood of this memoir is one of love and kindness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." This shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was. The end of paragraph @NUM2 it states "Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The way that her parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, "It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house were a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here that I learned the definition of "family". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love." It says right out that the "scent", or mood, is of love and that this is where he learned how to love. The mood of this article is very loving and kind.
0	4	4	The mood of the author in this memoir was happy, grateful, and gratitude. I say happy because in the story the author said "in our neighborhood despite customs else where, all of the cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship. I say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun. another mood is grate full the author as it says in the story "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author says this because the authors parents loved him a lot they went out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life and the author was greatful for that. Now the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did "parents created our traditional Cuban home" also "passed on to me the rich culonary skills and love for cooking" and "where I celebrated my first birthdays". The author had gratitude for all these things and more because without the things his parents did he wouldn't be who he is today.
0	4	4	The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting hapiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of hapiness. One example is, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This quote emphasizes the hapiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, "in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." This quote shows that they keep constant custom of their cultures warmth and detiration. Nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose.
0	4	4	The mood created in the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", is a mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness, even thought the memoir sometimes states how @PERSON1' parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood as sadness, the article mainly consists Of happy memories. An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood.
0	4	4	The mood created in The memoir was based off how The author felt about his "home" and "family". @CAPS1 was raised by parents that would let people stay in their house until they got back on their feet again, Their whole neighbor hood did it: "Quite The contrary, [his] neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was The norm and segregation prevailed in the United States (paragraph @NUM1)". @CAPS1 learned many diffrent things from them, like the definition of family: "Growing up in The environment instilled in [him] a great sense That "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1)". What @CAPS1 is trying to say that you can love Someone and call them your family even if they are not blood related. The feeling that @CAPS1 has towards his family is mutual to the feeling everyone else has with there's: "[@CAPS1] will always be grateful to [his] parents for @CAPS2 love and sacrafice (paragraph @NUM3)". @CAPS1 loves everyone who helped him through his life and @CAPS1 is grateful to have them. The mood in This memoir is love.
0	4	4	The mood created by the memoir is @CAPS1, gratefullness, and overall feeling of the story. One reason would be the mood of celebrations with his families and friends; from paragraph @NUM1 "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." Also the mood is gratefulness by how the family keeps the arms Open for people who need help because they knew that their friends/family would do the same; from paragraph @NUM2 "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us." There was also a depressing mood because Narciso family had to move from their friends and jobs to have a better life for the child/son; from paragraph @NUM3 "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." Also they're grateful and Admiration to do what they did came their; from paragraph @NUM4 "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." The moods created by this memoir filled the heart with depressing laungauge, gratefulness, @CAPS1, and admiration of the memoir.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is a happy and thankful mood. This is because of the happy memories Rodriguez describes in his memoir, his gratitude he expresses for his family in the end, and describing the hardships his family had to endure for him.First, Rodriguez brings a happy mood into the story because of the many happy memories he describes during the memoir. One of them, in paragraph @NUM1, is when he says "The passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."@CAPS1, the gratitude he expresses for his family in the last two paragraph conveys a thankful mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says, "I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."@CAPS2, by describing the hardships his family had to endure for him, Rodriguez furthers conveys a thankful mood. Rodriguez devotes the entire paragraph @NUM3 to describing how unselfish and kind his family was, thus thanking them.In the end, because of the happy memories described, his gratitude he expresses for his family, and by describing hardships his family had to face, @ORGANIZATION1 conveys a happy, thankful mood.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation which is displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when talking about how his parents lef cuba. He explains "they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life" (@NUM1). This description shows the mood of appreciation because it shows the author's parents left "selflessly", "to give their children a better life," which implies that his parents @MONTH1 not have wanted to come to @LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway, which clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation created when Rodriguez declares "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" (@NUM2). This informs the reader outright that rodriguez is" "greatful to his parents", which creates the mood of appreciation should through his tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso states "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM3). This statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that "he will never forget", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author of this memoir is a mixture of a few different moods. The author is proud and grateful of his family, home, and culture which makes of every relaxed and peaceful mood. For example he calls his house a "simple house". He also talks a lot about family and all of the people he cares about. The author makes a very loving and caring mood by doing this. He talks about the love for the people and things in his life that he cares about. He says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." That sentence shows a very loving and caring mood because its showing that he really loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him The last sentence in the memoir says, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This shows a mixture of both mood. It shows the love for his parents for making their house a home. But it also is very peaceful and relaxed because it is showing that throughout the memoir the author had the same mood of not letting stuff get to him and being grateful for the things he has.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the author said "they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrears in the country they loved" This quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1 shows how grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him. The last sentence of the memoir is "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfullness is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM3 when Narciso says "But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are." This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care. The reason this article is also happy is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM4 when he talks of "the endless celebrations" or "a love of cooking that is still with me today... "This is showing the "mood is happy and joyous because it is clear that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of happiness and @CAPS2 in his home. These are reasons as to why the author has created memoir with a mood of happiness and gratefulness
0	4	4	The mood created by the author is happy. A sense of security with friends families and neighbors. His parents sacrificed there careers and leave behind friends and family basically starting there life over for the benifit of their children.  Where Narciso lived was a nice two-family blond brick building. There she learnd cuban culture such as cooking and music that filted the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of "families." Not necessarily blood related, their neighbors were mostly immagrants and when all thoes cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close community were helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open. Alegria their land lords daughter came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also her aunts Bertha and Juanita along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Often someone would stay with them temporolly Even in hard times her parents would sacrifice anything for her And for that Narciso is greatful. Greatful to her parents for makeing a simple house into a home.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author is described in many ways.First, he described a friendly mood. In paragraph three, he says, "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative." And in paragraph four, he states, "... Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us. and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."@CAPS1, the mood is described as warm and family-like.

0	4	4	The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home.

0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude.                                                            The mood was created from the words, and the way the auther described his home and his appreciation of what his parents did for him. @CAPS2 was born into a simple house in a blonde-brick building situated in the @CAPS1 section of Newark, New Jersey. The auther said, "Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen." @CAPS2 explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him. "passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."                                                            The auther also explained how everyone in the community helped each other and treated each other like family. Even though his parents had no knowledge of the language or culture, they immigrated to make a better life for their children. They left everything behind them. Struggling financially and personally. @CAPS2 was eternally grateful for what they did.                                                                                                                                                                     In conclusion, the mood created by the auther was happiness of love and gratitude. "I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir was being gratefull. The author takes paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2 to fully explain his gratitude to his parents. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done." (@CAPS1 @NUM1) "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." (@CAPS1 @NUM2). These are the @NUM5 main points from paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. The author is thanking his parents for the numerous amount of things they have done for him, he is grateful. The author shows his gratitude throughout the excerpt, this common mood always remains.For instance, in @CAPS1 @NUM8 the author reminds the reader that "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Or in @CAPS1 @NUM9 when he writes "my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or courage." As you can see, the author constantly reminds the reader of how thankful/grateful he is to his parents. This sets the mood of being grateful throughout the story!
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their "families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." @CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative." That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was "I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming. loving place that holds so many memories.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is gratefulness. The mood created by the author in the memior of Narciso Rodriguez is gratefull. The author's memior is grateful especially according to paragraphs five, six, and seven. Paragraph five talks about how grateful he is for his mother and father to come to the United States with such courage, without having any knowledge of the language or of the culture. "The faith that this struggle would them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times." "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" is what starts off paragraph six. The author explains how he has been telling his parents of how much more courageous their plan was then his would have ever been. The author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly. His parent taught him two lessons with out telling him, but with their lives, "and these teachings have been the basis of my life", the author states. Finally in the last paragraph the very last sentence says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." which ultimately shows how grateful Narciso Rodriguez truly is.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm, grateful, and very palpable to the reader. One mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his love of his family. However, his "family" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hardwork and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." @CAPS1 could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, "my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life. And those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic, warm, and thankful. In the memoir the author explains the importance of family, recounts his experiences with family, and thanks his family for all the important life lesson they have taught him. In paragraph two the author says: "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home. In paragraph three the author says: "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." This sentence also makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a sense of his childhood community's unity and love. In paragraph five the author says: "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture." In this sentence the author really conveys his @CAPS1 of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them. In paragraph six the author says: "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Friends are." And later in paragraph seven: "It was here where I learned the real definition of 'Family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love." These excerpts really sum up the author's @CAPS1 about family. They explained to the reader how really important Family is and how thankful the author is for his family and all the life lessons they have taught him. These excerpts really convey the @CAPS1 of nostalgia, warmth, and thankfulness to the reader.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love, caring, and thankfulness. I say this because she really appriciates what her parents have done for her. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, she says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly." Also, "it was a close knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were really in need."; @CAPS1 @NUM2. This shows that Narciso and her family can trust the people in their community which is a thankful mood. Because they know that they would never do anything to hurt them. In the last @CAPS1, it says "it was here where I learned the real definition of family and I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This shows how thankful, loving, and caring he is to his parents. Narciso is proud of his parents because they let people stay with them, when they need to.. This is the moods created by the author in the memoir.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happines and Love for the @NUM1 reasons. first @CAPS1 parents "creatud aur traditional cuben home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking Duties." as said in paragraph @NUM2 and had Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. wich hade a feeling of happines in the house with the aroma of food and the music playing mixing in with the aroma also the parents helping each other in the kitcn gives the Love mood. Second is stated in paragraf @NUM3 "our Landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not wich shows the mood of love and happines between Narciso and Alegria with them eating together and being freinds. The last example is also in paragrafe @NUM3 as it said "countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet." wich was a kal the mood of Love for ther reletives to take them in until they are on track with thier Lives. That is the mood created by the author in the memoir is happines and Love.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, joyful, and loving. The mood is grateful because the author's parents were such wonderful people, that made the author look up to them. The author even says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was influenced by his culture. "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." After all a house is only a "home" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help. Example from the memoir is, "My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Over all, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says "In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times." @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says "countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood.
0	4	4	The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude.Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)." In the same paragraph he mentions the music, "Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 "Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us." This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." 
0	4	4	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is friendship and love. When the @CAPS1's parents moved to the United States, They created a traditional home. The hard being the kitchen. "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." In the kitchen celebrations, childhood, Friends and family formed the backdrop to their life. The @CAPS1 learned that '"family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.' The neighborhood the @CAPS1 lived in is made up of many different cultures but they blend with each other to form a small comunity of honest, hard-working immigrants who help others when they themselves are in need. "My parent's always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family." The many immigrants gave up their lives in cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children even though they did not know the language or culture. The @CAPS1 will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. There is no way to show her thanks for her parents love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, and showing her the importance of family and friends. The @CAPS1 states "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." They didn't just change it, they did it through love and friendship.
0	4	4	The mood created by the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez's mood was a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which came from his childhood home. In the passage "Narciso Rodriguez" it states "A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loveing and thoughtful feeling In the passage "Narciso Rodriguez" it states "it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love." In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the @CAPS1 inquires it with his word choice. Also in this passage "Narciso Rodriguez" it states "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home". This quote signify's all three moods loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was and the meanings. The mood to the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed.
0	4	4	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez and his mermoir is happiness. The author creates a very happy mood in this memoir. Here he describes how the people in his neighborhood acted towards each other. "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." The people in his neighborhood were very kind and generous people. The help each other whenever one is in need. The author makes the reader smile when reading about such a place. Another example of this is when he writes, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." To see such selfless act is just wonderful. The way the people sacrificed their lives for their child's is amazing. Reading about this just warms a person's heart. Another example proving this mood is when the author writes, "I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." The author is very proud of where he grow. It @MONTH1 not have been perfect but he managed to find the good parts. It is his pride that makes the readers feel happy for him. Thus, the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness.
0	4	4	The mood created @CAPS1 the author in the memoir is a positive and grateful mood for his home, and his parents. One example of the mood created @CAPS1 the author is in paragraph @NUM1 when he says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." The author is once again stating how thankful he is that his parents came to @LOCATION1. Another example of the mood of the story, is in paragraph @NUM2 when the auther states, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..." A final example of the mood created @CAPS1 the author, is when in paragraph @NUM3 he says, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." @CAPS1 saying this quote he means he is grateful for his parents sacrefice to come to @LOCATION1, but also being able to be raised in the traditional Cuban way. He also means that he had many great memories growing up in this home, and how they bonded together with their multi-racial neighbor's to battle through the tough times. The memoir has a very positive, happy and chearful mood about the Cuban family.
0	4	4	The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, "and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families...". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, "It was here where I learned the real definition of "family". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was.
0	4	4	The author of this memoir creates a warm, loving, lively and festive mood as he describes his home. A few times the author uses "warm" to describe the home, for example he says "warmth of the kitchen." @CAPS1 reads this memoir gets the feeling it's a bright and warm place. The reader also gets the feeling that everybody is loving and friendly, especially as the author talks about how immigrants from different places came together and were great friends. He also says his parents "always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family". @PERSON1 paints a picture of a home filled with love. There was also a lot of life at his house. "Endless celebrations [...] formed the backdropto life in our warm house. He also wrote that 'Cuban feasts [...] always filled the air with not just scent and music but life." From reading his memoir we get the feeling that his home was a great place to be during his childhood,he created a warm, inviting, and festive mood.
0	4	4	The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.
0	4	4	The author creates moods in the memoir that seem to be possitive. The first mood that is shown is a loving mood. In paragraph three is states, "All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." This shows when all the immigrants came to @LOCATION1 they would descriminated they all came together and became a family.Another mood that is created is careness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life." This quote shows that even before Narciso was born his parents were thinking about them. Narciso's parents wanted their child to have a good life. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has alot of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. By Narciso saying that it shows how much he loves his parents and how happy he is living in @LOCATION1. The author creates different moods throughout the entire excerpt.
0	4	4	The author created the mood of happiness that the authors parents went through such struggle, but in the end everything turned out fine because they have family. The author sets the tone of the struggle by describing the author's parents first home "A furnished one-room apartment," and that "racism was the norm and segregation prevaileel in the united States" @CAPS1 explains how her family had a hard time with money and that people were racist to them because of teir background. But, ten @CAPS1 describes how @CAPS1 overcame the struggle of her parents and the racism by uniting with all the other immigrants living in their neiborood. "Despite customs elsewhere , all of these cultures came together in greater solidarity and friendship". This sets the tone that even though tere were many bad things going on, they overcame it. @CAPS1 also sets that mood when @CAPS1 describes her traditional home. @CAPS1 says there was great food, "passionate cuban music", and "the congregation of family and friends". This sentence makes the reader feel happiness that they could go through such bad times of leaving their homelands to a neiborhood full of friendship and happiness. The author sets the tone by it first descring harsh times, and then talking about how happy her home is becuse @CAPS1 had her family and friends. Overall, the author sets te tone of happiness That this family overcame struggle.
0	4	4	The author created a warm, loving mood throughout the memoir. "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocense of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood because he talks about what he loves, such as Cuban music, and how friendship and family really come together to form his life growing up. "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents friendship and family. but also represents love and caring between all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares for each other, and they are all loving of each other. The mood changed near the end as well. It turned into totally love and warmth, but also happiness. "It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) this shows happiness because even though they are poor when they arrive in @LOCATION1, they are still celebrating the possibilities that are facing them.
0	4	4	The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing.  "pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home" (@NUM1). The former quote was found in paragraph @NUM1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. " They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life" (@NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done" (@NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph @NUM4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life.
0	4	4	The author created a sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one "family" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In @CAPS2 @NUM3 @CAPS1 says "There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." The author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir.
0	4	4	The @CAPS1 created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting. In this quote the authors childhood is revealed and how he feels about it, "The innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home. Also when the author says this it creats a happy @CAPS1 and shows how greatful he is to his parent's, "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The last qout wraps up his feeling about his life and how he feels "It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love./I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This quote show the love and warmth of everyone in the family and how a house can bring people together. This showed the warmth, love and selflessness of the family.
0	4	4	Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother. Fer example in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships." @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, "Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir.

One way the author does this is by writing very empathetacly. "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." (paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example in paragraph @NUM2. "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)" A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents.

The paragraph says, "and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 not be a grateful about simple things like cooking, but the Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. Paragraph @NUM1 says "Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily." This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them.

Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much. When this memoir is read the mood of love is expressed.

For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment.. The authors states, "… originally from Cuba… could afford to move into a modest… apartment I would soon call home" (@NUM1). This quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life. They did this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen "heart of the house is like and how even though they are New Jersey, their house still feels like cuba. The author says, "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what cuba is like. The authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (cuba and @LOCATION2).

In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."  @CAPS4 describes his comunnity as "close-knit" and "honest". This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community "extended a hand to people who were clearly in need." @CAPS4 calls his parents actions of coming to @LOCATION1 "courageous." @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immagrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives. Those are the moods set by the author.
0	4	4	In the article "Narciso Rodriguez," the author is explaining his home growing up. THe mood changes throughout, from "uplifting", to proud, to greatful.  All very relaxing tones.     First, the article starts off with background information. This section is uplifting, especially when the writers uses terms like "innocence, warm, and endless celebrations". When he states "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that compassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home," the reader gets a image of happiness in their mind this is one mood the author gives     @CAPS1 mood given off in the article is a sense of pride. Narciso Rodriguez says "It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugee to celaebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays." @CAPS2 no shame in that sentence. The author is honest, and shows how proud he is to explain how much he was proud of growing up.     Finally, the author gives off a greatful mood. He says that he learned the definition of family, and even though he wasn't put in the best home, many memories were made there In conclusion, the author shows different moods such as uplifting, sense of pride, and thanks giving.
0	4	4	In Narciso Rodriguez from: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates the mood of family and love in the memoir. @PERSON1 was a boy he lived with his parents in a three-room apartment. The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him the passionate Cuban music In the house, "...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (@NUM1). Then, @PERSON1 realized that " 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative" (@NUM2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, @CAPS1 the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet @CAPS1, "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us" (@NUM3). "It was in this simple house... where I learned the real definition of "family." And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM4).
0	4	4	In "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Narciso writes "Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." @CAPS1 loves the people that @CAPS1 calls his family, even if they aren't really related. @CAPS1 talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and it Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents. Narciso aknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. @CAPS1 says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing "I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love." I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where she learned the defenition of love, and how grateful @CAPS1 is to those who taught him it.
0	4	4	I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..." Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says "The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times." These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying "it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly." This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir.

This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness pre vails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir.

In paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author says that, "all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS1 also says, "My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."

The mood is thankful because @CAPS1 is appreciating all that his parents have done for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @DATE1, the author mentions being grateful of the cooking Skills passed onto him and "to his parents for their love and sacrifice." The feel the author creates of his "admiration" for his parents leaving their native country, comes through in the mood. Lastly, The mood is one of caring and welcome to friends and neighbors they considered family. In paragraph @NUM2, the memoir States that "Alegria" and the author's "surrogate grandparents", "graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not." These quotes @CAPS2 the openess and caring feeling in the home and family created by the mood of the story. This family kept their "door open" because they cared about "countless" people around them.

0	3	3	While reading Narciso Rodriguez I felt a certain mood. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, "I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage." that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man.

0	3	3	Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done." Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes "But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me." @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!
0	3	3	Throughout the story, the author put in details, explained things, and painted pictures in your mind all to set the mood for the story. A few different moods went on in the story but one of the most important was loving. not only was because of how close his neighborhood and family was, but because of the overall bond and unity they had shared but also because the parents "turned this simple house into a home."The author had also stated "always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love." This passage just completely revealed how much love had been in the air, even through those hard times. It also showed the importance of your loved ones and how you need them in your life.
0	3	3	Throughout the memoir, a very thankful and happy mood is shown. Narciso was raised in @LOCATION1, and knew why his parents had moved from Cuba, despite their love for the culture and weather. "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life." This quote shows Narciso's understanding of how much his parents gave up for him. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice." This shows how happy and thankful he has been throughout his life because he was given the chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. "I've often told them of my admireation for their strength and perseverance." Narciso's parents gave up alot to give him a better life, and he shows he will always be greatful for what they have done.

They where also lucky that they where going to have a better life. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed alot of love for each other.

When reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy. It talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents where. In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy
0	3	3	There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen." @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. Ultamately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective.
0	3	3	There are Three Things That discribe The @CAPS1 in This memior. one of Them is The authors love for his Cuban heritage. "@CAPS2 cuban music [which I love to this day] filled the air, Mixing The aroma of the kitchen. Another way The author discribes The @CAPS1 is The houses his parents owned. "In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in The @CAPS4 bound @CAPS5 of Newark, New Jersey". The last thing That discribes The @CAPS1 is The love and sacrifice That They gave there son. "It was in This simple house That My Parents Welcomed other refugees To celebrate @CAPS7 arrival To This country and where I Celebrated My first birthdays. "Cuban food and music were every were."                                                                                                                                             This is how the author discribes The @CAPS1 in This @CAPS9.
0	3	3	There Were many moods set by the @CAPS1 in the memoir. one of the moods was happiness. Narciso had a very happy family. They had many friends and Were thankful. Another mood the @CAPS1 set Was being proud. He was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness. A third mood in the memoir is love. Narciso and his family Were loved by many and they also loved many back. His parents arms and doors Were open at all times for anybody needed to get back on their feet. Narciso was grateful to have such a great family (including extended). Throughout this memoir there was moods of caring, loving, grateful, & happiness. Those Were the moods the @CAPS1 set into this memoir.
0	3	3	The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love." @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents. 
0	3	3	The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrafice, and warmth. All of these moods are demonstrated when the author describes all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she described everything her parents have done for her. The passage that states: "they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.", @CAPS1 that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so much that they were willing to give up their lives in their country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better. Their family provided warmth and care for everyone who needed it. They truly learned the real meaning of family. The author created a very loving mood in this memoir.
0	3	3	The mood would be loving and carring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. "Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States." It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us". His parent's instilled How important familey is and friends.
0	3	3	The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.
0	3	3	The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could.
0	3	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author describes his home and how even though the house wasn't much, his parents made it feel inviting and comfortable. In his neighborhood, all the people were friends and took care of each other when they needed help. The author's home reflected the Cuban culture because of his parents. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate in not getting good jobs. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems get to them.

Quote: "Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blond relative." To wrap it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was about love and happiness.
0	3	3	The mood the @CAPS1 creats in the memoir is a mixture. In reading the story you feel happy, and greatfull, this is because the @CAPS1 is stating how great her family and friends were, along with how great her life was. She also states that you dont need alot of money or a big house to be happy. In paragraph @NUM1 she says "I will always be greatfull to my parets for their love and sacrifice." This says to me, that very happy and she very greatfull to have parents like she does and that she would never want to loose them. She also states in paragraph @NUM1 "in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..." To me, everyone should be this gratfull to their family and loved ones because you never know when you're going to loose one

0	3	3	The mood that the author created in this memoir was love and gratefullness. The author is trying to get their message across about how much a family is bonded together and how much there is to be thankful for. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows how much love the author has to be grateful for. He is also trying to say that there is no way to express his emotions and love to his parents. "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." The authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"
0	3	3	The mood that is @CAPS1 and that it is created by the author in the memoir is the feeling of being thankful. This is the mood @CAPS1 because it says "Their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." This @CAPS3 the mood is thankful because author is thankful for the culinary skills that is still with him.

Growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At this time racism, and segregation prevailed in the United States. Despite customs elsewhere, all the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.                                                                                                                                      It was a closeknit community of hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need of a helping hand.

0	3	3	The mood of this memoir is relaxed, happiness and thankfulness. Narciso makes their home feel peaceful and realxed. "a great sence that family had nothing to do with being blood realted." This shows that @CAPS1 is very happy with his household and his life that @CAPS1 shares with all of his "family." @CAPS1 is very thankful for his parents for giving him a good life and for giving up theres in cuba do come to @LOCATION1 to help give him a better life. "I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.
0	3	3	The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parent both move to @LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one room house untill they moved to New Jersey, were Narciso grew up. Inside that home the family created a beautiful Cuban communitie. The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey were the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. The community was like a big family, "the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship." All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a "family" really means. She never would have know what that ment or have had these oppertunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over. As Narciso says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
0	3	3	The mood of this memoir is good. It's good because everybody is happy. Narciso is in a good mood and inviting everybody into is his. The excerpt says... "My door will always be open". Also in there house's they have music going on all the time. The excerpt also says... "In our meighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship". There were also very unselfish, caring of everyone, and did whatever they could for there families. In this memoir there was a overall pretty good mood of everybody because they were nice, inviting, and caring.
0	3	3	The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home, his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said "came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home.
0	3	3	The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their "family". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him.
0	3	3	The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him oppurtunitys despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming.
0	3	3	The mood of the memoir is love. @PERSON1 and his family "... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the "same for (them)" (@NUM1). Even though"(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family. Prior to moving to the United States, "Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find" (@NUM3). They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs, so that thier son could live a better life Narciso doesnt take this for granted. He engulfs the in a profusion of thanks. Throughout the memoir the author costantly writes about all the caring and love in the lives of @PERSON1 and his family.
0	3	3	The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."     As you can see, the author. Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing.
0	3	3	The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)". "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." And Narciso also said "It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."
0	3	3	The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, "great solidarity and friendship"it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say "happiness is nothing without appreciating it" and as he says "I learned the real defnetion of family" so apparently he knows real happiness
0	3	3	The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in "a rough life," having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful
0	3	3	The mood in this memoir created by the author, was very peaceful and extremely loving. It was also a big thank you to his parents for everything they did for him. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice." The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. "@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well. This is an amazing piece of work.
0	3	3	The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. "Family"  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home.
0	3	3	The mood in the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic. One reason is they never gave up no matter how hard it was. Narciso said that his parents, "drove them to endure these hard times," so, no matter how hard the times are they never gave up. Another reason is they stayed very close with their family. The author wrote, "all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table, "this shows that their whole family was very close to each other. My final reason is that the Rodriguez's always wanted to help. Narciso said, "My parents always kept their arms and their doors open," which shows that they always wanted to help people in need. The mood in the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez," from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic.
0	3	3	The mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful." This shows how @CAPS1 thanks his parents for loving cooking. Skill that cooking and his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it says "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." @CAPS1 is happy that @CAPS1 grew up in @LOCATION1 and how grateful @CAPS1 is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work.

Narciso is pround and thankfull of his parents, of them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." They came to @LOCATION1 "to give their children a better life." They struggled, taking any job that they could find, They struggled for him, so he didn't have to struggle. Narcisco admires them for "their strength and perseverance." Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him.                      He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.                                                                                                       Narciso is happy and grateful for his life that he was given by his parents.

Happiness is seen by the reader when he Is ex plaing the way many different cultures "come together in great solidarity and friendship" @PERSON1 is happy he grew up here and is happy with everything about his childhood in this neighborhood. The author loves everything about this neighborhood. @PERSON1 especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them. @PERSON1's writing is very lively and he writes with great passion. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic.

They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying "I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice".

Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual. The mood he sets when narrating this is @CAPS1 because, not once did he ever take life for granted."I will always be greatfull for what my parents showed within love and sacrifice, @CAPS6 ofen told them for what they have done was more couragoas Than i could have ever reached".
0	3	3	The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents. The author (@ORGANIZATION1) explains how it was for him as a kid and his "family" doesn't always mean a blood relative. He describes the household as being very humble and always had open arms and welcomed others. He also says that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was, it was about the people inside it and how close they were and the memories they shared. All in all through this memoir @PERSON1 (the author) shows that he is very appreciative of his family and wouldn't change how we grew up and thanks his "family" for impressing the spirit of generosity upon him in an early age.

The author is happy, remembering memories, which are not unhappy or unpleasant. It's not romantic, lonely, or sad, it's happy, fun-filled, friendly, and fulfilled.

The mood @CAPS2 and created by Narciso Rodriguez is proud and admiring of his parents, and very happy.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes "a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today" and how "Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today." The author got this love from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his "parents always kept there arms and door open." I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he "will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice." This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author was grateful. The mood is grateful because he gives thanks to his parents For "... their love and sacrifice" (¶@NUM1). This memoir is based on the definition of family. Rodriguez explains that Family means many things. It means helping others, accepting everyone, and for his parents giving up your life so your children could have a better one. He recalls the many people his mother and father help. The people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family. The courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their country to start over. He tells them of his "...admiration of their strength and perseverance" (¶@NUM1). There is still "no way to express my gratitude" (¶@NUM1), he also states. He will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author of the excurpt "Narciso Rodriguez" From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives in the memoir was love, happiness, and old memories of home. In paragraph seven it states "... i celebrated my first birthdays. it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house..." That shows how much he loved his home, even though it wasn't purfect. Also in paragraph four he say's "..our landlords and his daughter Alegria-my first friend..." Narciso's tell's about his first friend. But the tone that gives the best mood of the story is the memorie that Narciso's say's "... i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home...". In paragraph seven.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author is welcoming. "In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey." This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. "In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship." This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen." This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home
0	3	3	The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningfull adviroment. They made there house have a Cuban feel to it. They have passionate Cuban music playing, and aromas from the kitchen. Anyone who needs to stay at a place, stays there. His parents moved here and left everything  behind them, friends, family, and jobs. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most important thing in your life. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author is a happy mood. I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. "It was a close – knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood. A @NUM3 and final reason I think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family. "They came selflessly… to give their children a better life… I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). I think that he loves his family, and love is definitely a happy word.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir was really grateful and that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it shows how grateful he his about his family because in paragraph @NUM2 it says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done." This shows that he is really happy and grateful for what he has and that he actually realizes how many sacrifices they did for him and how much they love him
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that she is very grateful for everything of her parents had done for her and showed her. She is very happy for all the things she has and she admires her parents for their love and sacrifices they took. In this memoir she talks about how her parents came to the United States in 1956 and then had only a one-room apartment with her and her sister. They finally afforded to move into a three-room apartment. She finally called it a home (as she says in the article). She is very thankful for he family and important friends. She says they showed her lives, and these teachings have been the basics of her life. This is the author's mood in the memoir.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoroir is gentla and proudness. The author explains of how he felt of his parent that risk everything in order to give him a better future according to paragraph @NUM1. The author feels proud of being from Cuba through the whole memoroir. He feel proud of being Cuban by explaining the things he does and things that they share by his culture. Last but least he feels thankfulness according to paragraph @NUM2 becouse, through his parents and things from his country he learned what family really means, he says "... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home". Through the whole memoroir the auther show proudness of wher re he came from, from his parents, country, and his neighborhood.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood was a good feeling. To explaination of how he lived @NUM1 reality. Having family come live with you till they get back on their feet. Having family all around you. Realizing you turned your "house into a Home". Endless celebrations that encompassed, both form a a backdrop to life in their warm home. "they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved." "The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved." "In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering." In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times." Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was ment to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very hapy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful. The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" @CAPS1 also said, "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The memoir focused on how @CAPS1 is so greatful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was happy and greatful.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, @CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents "for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 "thanked them repeatedly." This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved ." @CAPS1 example from the text says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. 
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes "Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that "family" had nothing to do with being blood relatives."The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving caring child in the US. Also he was proud that even though his family moved to th US from Cuba he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep up with is culture by having family come over." My @CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary… regularly joined us at our table." (ph @NUM1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez family came to join his parents and him for dinner. Narciso family gave up everything including leaving Cuba so he can have a better life. A life that his family can be proud of.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says "here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house." And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states "Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." This shows that the author is truly grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her and he or she is really joyful now thinking back and makes the mood of the memoir joyful and grateful.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is forever grateful to his parents for starting their lives over so he could live a good life in @LOCATION1 This is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life in @LOCATION1. He gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph @NUM2. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece.      Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family "'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative," he states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what. This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness, unity, and caring. "The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm house." The author shows that he likes his house and enjoys how it is, "family had nothing to do with being blood relative. saying that all can be family as long as you care about each other." Close-knit community"shows unity. "@CAPS1 get families get back on their feet." shows caring. she enjoyed doing this It made her happy. That is how the author in the memoir made the mood of happiness, unity, and caring.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring. He says, "In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home. He says, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy, and loving his life.First of all, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Here is a quote from the text. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."@CAPS1, the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. Here is evidence from the article. "A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."@CAPS2, the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving his life. Here is a quote from the article. "I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."In conclusion, my main point here is to show you how joyful Narciso is.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is created by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says "the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extened a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Thats another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because hes talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about peoples love toward eachother which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, calm, and kind mood. It is a happy mood because the author only talks about the good things that happened to him and his family. It is a very calm mood because nothing very exciting or nothing very sad happens, everything in the memoir is very calm. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is also a very kind mood because his parents are very kind. In paragraph @NUM1, "my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. This shows that Narciso Rodriguez's parents are very kind people. Narciso Rodriguez creates a very happy, calm, and kind mood in his memoir.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one. The author tells how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956 and how he was born in 1961. He never said one negative thing about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He mentioned how his parents had a love for cooking and that love was passed down to him. He said that he was grateful for that. He also mentioned that, along with the cooking, was Passionate Cuban music. He described his neighborhood as being made up of "all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." As a final sentence, the author stated how we "will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, "Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive." This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, "They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is [Love] … I feel this is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it says "I have been grateful to my parents for there love and sacrifice. Another reason is in paragraph @NUM2, it says "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull). And the final reason is in paragraph @NUM3 It says "It was here where I learned the true definition of "family" And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example "(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example "I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways.
0	3	3	The mood created by the author (narciso Rodriguez) in the memoir was that he was grateful/appreciative for his life, and also happy with his life. Through out this memoir I think he has realized and is explaining what family really is and that he is grateful for having one. You'll figure this out when you read this because he states, "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being blood relative." what he also says that proves his mood was grateful is, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 with all this being said I believe thats what his mood was through out the memoir.
0	3	3	The mood created by narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. "I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done..."p. @NUM1. He closed it off with how he could never forget how his parents turned a house into a home, appreciation flowing strongly
0	3	3	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, "Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative." Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home.
0	3	3	The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @PERSON1 recounts how more often than not there would be a guest at his table. It could be Alegria his "babysitter and first friend," his surrogate grandparents, or any number of friend and relatives. There was a constant "congregation of Friends and family" they generously hosted, because his Family knew that because of their generosity, they would always be welcome at other people's houses. "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." This constant congregation of Friends and family in @PERSON1's home, creates a mood of generosity and friendship throughout the memoir.

0	3	3	The mood  that was created by the author is something that not alot of people have. In the selection Narciso shows that he is thankful for being cuban living in the united states. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in cuba  to give their children a better like. Narciso has "a love of cooking" because he was raised with his parents both cooking and having cullinary skills he was passionate of cuban music which "filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen". To Narciso Growing up in his envirenment family had nothing to do with blood relative and, was more as someone who  you think of as to being like family. For Narciso there was no way for him to show the gratitude and generosity that he got in such an early age. And how important he learned that family and friends are.
0	3	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a passionate mood in his experiences of having a "home" rather than just a house, and how growing up in such a different community has shaped the man he has become today. Narciso is forever grateful for his parents' willingness to give up their good lives in Cuba and move to @LOCATION1 for the sake of him. The selflessness and thoughtful choices Narciso's mother and father made truly don't have words that are able to describe it. Narciso feels that you don't have to be related, of the same background or believe in the same things in order to be "family." The loving atmosphere of living in the neighborhood of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants was created by the feeling of coming together and having a good time, despite all of the differences. Narciso cherishes the memories he has kept of his childhood very much and will always admire his parents for the sacrifices they made for him.
0	3	3	The author's mood of this memoir is extremely thankful and appeciative. He said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and mentions what struggles they had, beginning in a one room apartment then affording to move into a three room apartment for him to call home. He explains how his parents started their lives entirely over in @LOCATION1, and needed to take whatever work they could find. They were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times. The author had so much admiration of his parents strength and perseverance. He learned the true meaning of 'family" and about how to love. He was really appreciative for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and how important family & friends are that his courageous parents had taught him, that had also become the basis of his life.
0	3	3	The author that wrote this story created a lot of mood. First, the story created a lot of love. For example in paragraph @NUM1 his parents had to leave all that they loved The had to leave their country, family, friends, and there careers. His parents left behind so much. secondly, there is a lot of gratefulness in the story. For example in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso is very grateful for what his parent had to give up and for their love. He also said that what they did was more courageous than something that he could have ever done. Thirdly, there is a lot of sadness and generosity. Narciso is stating how impressed and generous his parents were and he realizes how important friends and family are in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learn wasn't just taught, but were shown by his parents lives. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading.
0	3	3	The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes..."My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..." In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three room house he called home.
0	3	3	The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents "moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love." Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area "home". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading.
0	3	3	The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 explains that his parents left Cuba with quite goods jobs. His father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering. They both came to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just "tell" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefullness in this memoir.
0	3	3	The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story.

Also the author say's that a home is where geat memeries are and were you grow up, you should never forget it.

One reason he loves his family is because, "my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same." This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. "They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love." This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on.

"I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done." It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard.

Narciso describes his neighborhood as "of honest, hardworking immigrants." "Growing up in this environment gave me a sense of family' that had nothing to do with being a blood relative." A picture of kind, smiling faces is painted by this description of a tightly-knit, ever-willing to hep group of people. Rodriguez tells of his parents' creation of a beautiful home from just a house.

Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: "they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love." In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful.

And he also says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This is the mood I think that the author created in the memoir.
0	3	3	In this memoir, there is more than one mood. There is love, friendship, and happiness Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."

0	3	3	In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and apperciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say "aw". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, "was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you.

0	3	3	In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were.

0	3	3	In this memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)." I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good.
0	3	3	In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a "giving" mood, for example explained in paragraph four "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us." It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future. In paragraphs one and two the mood is happy and comfy because she is happy about her home, her family and the love she has been given in her life. These are the various moods in the memoir.
0	3	3	In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a "home sweet home" mood.

The smell is like, "your home". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated.

The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times. Throughout this memoir the author creates moods, whether good or bad, of the memories of his childhood.

Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice," @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."

0	3	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a nonstalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. "And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents turned his house, to a home he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more nonstalgic. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a nonstalgic mood from the memories of his past.
0	3	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez he creates a mood of appreciation. He talked about how grateful he was that his parents selflessly came to @LOCATION1 to give their child a better life.

0	3	3	In the memoir of "Narciso Rodriguez" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said "that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. "In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1." They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him.
0	3	3	In the memoir from "Home: The blueprints of our lives" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home. Then, how it was in @LOCATION1 he learned the real definition of the word "family", and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real.
0	3	3	In the memoir from "Home: Blueprints of our lives" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author stretches the importance of family. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates is a comfortable, loving, homey feeling. He states that he grows up learning that "family has nothing to do with being a blood relative". He says that his family welcomed everybody. Strangers that needed help, neighbors, and extended family. He creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a "close-knit community". He also says "These cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS1, when @PERSON2 says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home," you can sense his appreciation and feel the comforting atmosphere. Those were the moods I felt while reading this memoir by, Narciso Rodriguez.
0	3	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he undoubtedly creates a mood of happyness and love, love for his family and friends. His definition of family is different from other people's definitions, but many people would agree with his definition. He calls family not only blood relatives, but the love and friendship that people have for eachother. By creating a mood of love and happyness draws the reader into a cultural story and how his life was affected by that of his parents, and his family. When he describes the food, the laughter, the neighbors, the kitchen, and the house, it all feels very warm and feels like a place someone would love to be at. Because he talks about things people want to hear, he accomplishes a great feeling of warmth and being happy throughout the reading.

(@CAPS1 @NUM2) In 1961 he was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. @PERSON1, Sr. was a mood like man he was greatful, kind, traditional, and happy.

0	3	3	In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because whe he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says "I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" that indicates how apriciative he was.

As well as his cuban upbringing. He describes how thier house was always full with family and friend and how there was always a big cuban feast and cultural music playing. Finally, Narciso depicts how his community that he lived in was unity and strong even though they did not have the same heritage or background.The mood in which Narciso creates his memoir is very upbeat. He never says anything negative about his family, friend, or community. Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for his heritage and thier will to give him a better life. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more background information.Narciso's memoir was a very heart felt story. It made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story.
0	3	3	Immagrants from Cuba to the @CAPS1 usuely had to undergo a tough transitien. It took buckets full of curage and modevation to get through this huge transitien. Narciso Rodriguez's famly whent through this move using family power and the love they had for each other. It was a big change for them to be in a one room apartment to a @NUM1 room apartment. Through the memoir there was a mood of satisfaction and love for Cuba. For example, the memoir stated many times how much Narciso enjoyed the Cuban food and music and treditiens. Also the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talkes about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to @CAPS2 to give him a better life. This showes that the love of a parent is stronger than enything in the world. Another mood is relieve. for example Narciso is relieved that his family made it to @CAPS2 sofly and sand. This article is a perfect example that family is all you have in the end and that nomatter what they are there for you.
0	3	3	I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination.
0	3	3	I think the mood is happiness because when she was talking about he cooking skills and how she was listening to cubin music in pertheisis it said stuff like which I still love today. When she said our house became a home I think that ment that they are happy settled in theres not alot of stress and everyone seems comfortable. She kept say how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house. It just made me think she has to be really happy with her family her house and her life. She must be happy with her life here in @LOCATION1
0	3	3	I think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood. The author is grateful that she has parents that moved to @LOCATION1 for her. Also she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a home. This says so in the last sentence "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." Also Narciso is thankful in paragraph @NUM1 "my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved." @CAPS1 how thankfull Narciso seems to her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her. If that was me writing that story I would make the mood very grateful towards my parents.
0	3	3	I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy I think.Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that "I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they "turned a simple house into a home" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are.
0	3	3	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor.
0	3	3	I beleive the mood that sets off in the beggining of the story is how in her house cuban music and great aroma's From @CAPS1's @CAPS2 through the air, I also think that it gives picture of laughter and happiness, And I think that throughout the story @CAPS3 tells that @CAPS3 relizes through spending time with community that his parents are teaching him, Just because someone isn't blood related dosent mean they can't be lik family as said in the package, There teaching him that It Is also people that love you and care about you. As @CAPS3 continues through the passage It says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help. @CAPS3 soon relizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in Life the true meaning of family.
0	3	3	Home: The Blueprints to Our Lives is a wonderfull memoir that tells what a "home" is truly about. It has a loveing and careing mood to with that shows that very thing.     Love is what the author, Narciso Rodriguez likes the most about his home. He talks about how he grew up and his parents took people in that needed support and helped them out.      Going on to talk about how his parents cared about him for them to come to @LOCATION1 for him, to get and have a good education and a better life. This is something that takes a couragous person to do and a person that loves and cares and wants the best for others. Because family sets of mood and that is love and careness.
0	3	3	Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life.
0	3	3	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important.
0	3	3	By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that "they take anyone in until they are back on their feet", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the "mood of the story.
0	3	3	Based on the memoir, the mood the author creates is warming and grateful.first of all, warming because in paragraph four @NUM1 and five lines @NUM2 through @NUM3 it states "my parents always Kept thieR arms and their door open to the many people we consider family..."@CAPS1 and finally, the author created the mood that @CAPS2 was gratful in paragraph(s) six line(s) @NUM4 the author States "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what the did was a much courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my Gratitude."In colclusion the authors mood(s) of the memoir are warming and grateful.
0	3	3	According to the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a mood throughout the memoir. The mood was happiness because Narciso was happy with his life.One example of Narciso's happiness is with his home. When @CAPS1's telling about the apartment @CAPS1 grow up in the mood is happy. Although it wasn't much his parents made him comfortable in it. They made it seem like Cuba as much as they could. Narciso loved his apartment even if it wasn't Cuba. In paragraph two "within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home." @CAPS1 was happy with the apartment because his parents made it feel like a Cuban home to him.Another example of Narciso's happiness is with his family. Narciso tells how his friends seem like family. In paragraph four "Our landlord and his daughter... do the same for us." Even though the people aren't blood related to him @CAPS1's still happy with them. Finally, based on the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created a happy mood. This mood was created because Narciso is happy with the life @CAPS1 lives.
0	3	3	A wonderful mood was created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author, in this memoir. While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: "I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice." Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words. Also, the childhood home is described in paragraph @NUM3. Rodriguez describes the house's feeling as warm & elaborates on the things he's grateful to and will always love. The mood of this memoir is very specifically felt.
0	3	3	A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have. "... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describingwhat his parent's did that he was proud of. "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture." (@CAPS1 @NUM2) "they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships." (@CAPS1 @NUM2) These were the moods the author expressed in the memoir.
0	3	3	@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home. ...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. "Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. "I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live."
0	3	3	     In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home. The loving way she talks about her parents' appartment and their kitchen and the Cuban culture they combined into their everyday lives suggest that Narciso has wonderful memories of her parents. Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where "'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative." (@NUM1) The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to @LOCATION1 in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture.
0	2	2	the mood created in the memoir, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Ive often told them that what they Did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Ive often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how importand family and friends are.
0	2	2	Your home @CAPS4 were you find happyness, joy and peace. Not only is home a @CAPS1 to be @CAPS2 but a @CAPS1 for family to be unified. In this @CAPS3, The author explains what it is to have a family and what it is and means. Joy and peace is the over all mode and thats what family @CAPS4 feel likeMany farmles in @LOCATION1 are immagrants and thats what makes up @LOCATION1. Many people stuggle to give education and happiness to there familys.

0	2	2	This was a touching story of how this boy appreciates his family and parents so much. There is a mood through the story.Home to this boy is about family and relationships. He talks about how he liked the kitchen and cooking, just like his mother and father. That is a mood of happiness.The kitchen is why he loves. He talks about his Cuban culture and how he appreciates his parents bravery to come to @LOCATION1.The mood is mostly appreciation in the story. He is very appreciative.
0	2	2	This passag has a very calm and happy mood. He is looking back on his childhood and the memories. He talked about the cheerful house, people and neighborhood. You could picture the house and smell the aromas. Narciso set a very nice setting and tone that the entire passage was lifted in energy. You could tell he was passionate about what she was writing. He showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with. The way he felt about her childhood was potrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community like feel. Her gratefullness potrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read.
0	2	2	This memoirs mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. This story is about how @PERSON1 parents created a home. His parents put love, unity, kindness and happiness in their home. He is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to @LOCATION1 with little and creating a foundation for their future life. He's thanking them for making their simple house into a loving home. The mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness. He is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home. Durring this piece he is happy that his parents were brave and came to @LOCATION1, that is why this memior also has a happy mood.
0	2	2	This memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez," from "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives," is very enjoyable. The mood made it really easy to understand and read.The mood of this story is not funky or funny. The mood is like haveing a regular conversation with a person. I like when the author adds little perenthesis, it gives it a personal touch and adds more of a conversation touch to the mood. For example in paragraph @NUM1, "Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)." Its more of a fun fact or personal note.In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez," has a very formal mood, with a personal twist. The formal mood makes the memoir easy to understand, while the personal twist makes the story enjoyable to read. This is how to use mood correctly.
0	2	2	This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart – felt. The @CAPS1 – @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did.
0	2	2	This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I espicially think the part when he said "Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and  endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. Also, where he states that family "has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one.
0	2	2	There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the "innocence of childhood" and the "gratitude for the spirit of generosity" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he "groups" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have.
0	2	2	There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parent were from Cuba and they werent very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three room apart ment in a niehgborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. Narciso had great parents according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." @CAPS1 means that @CAPS1 didn't care about the amount of space they had in the apartment @CAPS1 just cared and love the amount of love and the relationship they all had eachother.
0	2	2	There are many ways the mood was created by the author in the memoir. One way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's past memories. An example of this was "passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air." This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because culture music came from the author's memories, which is the mood. Another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's opinions of the memories. An example of this was in paragraph @NUM1 "(and for which I am eternally grateful)." This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in there own way which set the mood.
0	2	2	There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the moods are loving "I learned here how to love." @CAPS1 mood is caring "my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family. And @CAPS1 mood was happiness "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations" That is the mood of this memoir.
0	2	2	The narrator is describing the life he grew up in. How his parents cooked in the kitchen and played Cuban music. How great things were. He was trying to create a warm happy mood by decribing how his parents try to help the people and do the best the could With anything. Showing greatness in life when you barly have much yourselve.
0	2	2	The mood was calm as if it was a wonderful place to be in that will also makes like wanting to live their forever. As in the relevant it says "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home". Passing the mood of his great @CAPS1 house and his coulture in this relevant it shows that they have wonderful times and great friends.
0	2	2	The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is. Narciso shows how greatful and proud she is that her parents would change cultures, language, and also find a new job so she could be born in @LOCATION1. The author also shows how close their family is. They have an extended family because they live with their grandparents. Narciso is very proud to live in the family she is, and grateful that her parents did all of that for her.
0	2	2	The mood the author gave in the @CAPS1. was a very happy, thoughful, respectful, thankful, moved when he explained his reason and his thoughts, him expressing his family life was very nice he said the best things his parents did for him was to leave there family in cuba and start a new life in @LOCATION1 for new life and, future, also he expressed that he always thanked his parents for what they have done for him. but he knew that wasn't the best way it was just that he had to prove he was thankful.
0	2	2	The mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed. It is also very opening. It is opening because it says we let anyone we consider family stay over for however long period of time. They are very happy and relaxed because in paragraphs @NUM1 it seems like everyone is mellow, and greatful to be in this country. They are so happy to have decent jobs, and new lives. This is the mood the author swings into the story. The author did a great job fixing these into the story to make it flow very well.
0	2	2	The mood the author created in the memoir was... him or herself expressing what it was like but then when something like that happened to them. Also he was explaining how he was really happy that their parent gave up everything in Cuba just to come be with their children, they Also didnt even know how to speak english when they first moved from cuba. So now pretty much their whole family lives close to eachother so they can all see eachother. Even if the parents can't find the jobs there looking for they were going to do whatever to make their family happy. Now that their family together They can spend the rest of there life happy together
0	2	2	The mood the author created in the memoir was calm, @CAPS1 saying "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house." she gives off a calm relaxed feeling. And makes us portra a peaceful setting.
0	2	2	The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house." @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood.
0	2	2	The mood the @CAPS1 created was a mood of happiness and gratitude. The @CAPS1 States how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him. He also stated that he admired them and honestly could never repay them for everything they did This shows how the @CAPS1 @CAPS4 how his parents worked so hard to make his life better. He is forever greatful.
0	2	2	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words describe the mood because in the memoir the author would talk about how eternally greatful he is for his family. He talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other thats all that matters. They got along great and were very happy they had each other. They also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives. They saw everyone as family and as little as they had, all they wanted was to give back. That was the mood created by the author. 
0	2	2	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.
0	2	2	The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him. For example "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give thier children a better life, even thought it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." This is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him.
0	2	2	The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft happy and @CAPS1 mood. He trys to say how grateful and happy about his memoir. An example is "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their Rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am enternally gratefull)" OR "Passionate Cuban Music (Which I adore to this day). His mood is also saying that hes happy for what he has because he said that his parents are very couragous and he could of never did what they did. The authors mood is very grateful.
0	2	2	The mood that the author in the memoir created was good by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage.To start with her love is like part of her life. He love his parents. For example In the storie say's "I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 this mean she loves he parent for every little single thing they did. Also he learn how to love people.As will as her blood relative meaning that he @CAPS2 got to do with nothing of this. She is from cuba, and came to the united state on 1956. Also born to this a simple house. His that build a traditional home.This is how the author describe the mood, by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage.
0	2	2	The mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy, emotional, and @CAPS1 and caring. The are happy because the are all living together in a perfect place all together. It is emotional because the care and love for each other. They help each other out. In paragraph @NUM1 it states "these are two lessons that my parents did not just tellme. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basic of my life. And those are some of my reason why the author added mood to this memoir
0	2	2	The mood of this story is happy, hopful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) "They struggled both personally and financially." At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, "courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration." This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems. This is set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States.
0	2	2	The mood of this passage is very warm and personal. Narciso is very reflective in this passage about how his parents were so unselfish and gave up their life in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. Narciso goes on saying how unselfish his parents are, and how they take people in to give other people a better life not just themselves. Narciso's parents were very caring, and very meaningfull to him. He continues the mood by talking about what a true family is. How it's not just someone your blood related to, but who you care about and love.
0	2	2	The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the "home" is so pleasent to be inside.
0	2	2	The mood of this article created by Narciso Rodriguez in "The blueprints of our lives." Is selfessness, admiration, gratitude, and thankfullness. In paragraph @NUM1 it takes about how his parents did his out of love, for her children, not for her. It also @CAPS1 the friend ship of all other imagrints trying to start lives in america. As it States in paragraph @NUM2. This article is fille d with love and respect for family and friends, that is what the atheur was saying.
0	2	2	The mood of the memoir is pleasent. @PERSON1 talks about her nice childhood. She talks about selfless her parents are to her. Also the mood is set when @PERSON1's is parents help other people get back on their feet. Also talking about how people would eat dinner with @PERSON1's family. She also tells about how she had family that weren't exactly blood relatives but, they were people who cared for each other like a family. Also the way Narciso told was with a very pleasant tone.
0	2	2	The mood of the author is very greatful. I know this because @CAPS1 keeps repeating, "I am greatful for all my parents did." @CAPS1 is also compationate. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 sais, "It was here that I learned the real definition of 'family'." and it continues "I will never forget this house or gracious neighborhood."
0	2	2	The mood of the author and the memoir was happy. He or she seemed proud of everything about theirselves. He or she didn't let anyone stand in their way of their culture, home, and parents. For example the author said "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." When i read that last sentence of the whole memoir I understood what feeling the author was getting. He or she was in all kinds of moods. Some was happy, some was grateful, and some was exciting. The mood the author was in made me realize that I need to appreciate what I got. In my home, in my school, everywhere and everyone around me. The mood of the author in the memoir was grateful. and happy.
0	2	2	The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house.
0	2	2	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment. Then talks about delicious foods and great music. But at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life.
0	2	2	The mood is set to a sad feeling. Filled with poverty the auther sets it up this way. There is a mood of love too. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." It also says that they learned the real definition of family. this is why it is set too a sadly love mood. They were an immigrants. This memoir is inspirational.
0	2	2	The mood is nutral in the authors memoir. he speaks about his house and family. He tells the reader how greatfull he was have loving parents, stated in line @NUM1 parigraph @NUM2. The author also speaks about how important his family and friends were/are. The mood is somewhat happy because he was remembering the good times he had as a child growing up with his Cuban family.
0	2	2	The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example @PERSON1 would do anything for his family. If @PERSON1 did not do anything for his loved ones he would not care for them. Second, it is happy. For example @PERSON1 has a baby sitter and his first friend. Lastly, it is loveing. An example is when he talks about his parents. He is very greatful when he talks about his parents and the mood describes that by makeing the home feel loved.
0	2	2	The mood in this memoir I think would be happiness because his parents gave him happiness by being there all the homieness. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This show how much they've done for him and he has apreciated. Overall this is reconizing that family and happiness are unified.
0	2	2	The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home.
0	2	2	The mood in the memoir represents friendship, family, helpfulness, one example of helpfulness is in the @NUM1 paragraph it says "It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working, immigrints who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own Kind, were clearly in need." @CAPS1 good example of the mood in this memoir is family but also ties back to helping is in paragraph @NUM2 it says, "My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concider family. Knowing that they would do the same for us. This is what the memoir is about.
0	2	2	The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family iregardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says "Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative".
0	2	2	The mood in the memoir is happyness, and friendship, and glory, an example is "My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. A feeling of friendship and honesty is "it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need." and that is the mood of the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood in the memior of Narciso Rodriguez is one of admiration, satisfaction, and courage. Narciso had admiration for his parents who sacrifaced a set life for a better one for Narciso. His parents caring and unselflessly came to @LOCATION2 struggled personally and financially. He was satisfied with life he had. through family values and determination he was able to succeeb. Courage beacuse his family was able to give him a better life here eventhough they were better off in Cuba. It was struggled but they were determined to do it for Narciso. The mood overall is admiration. Admiration is the mood in the memior Narciso Rodriguez fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey.
0	2	2	The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture it made me think about who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in.  It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family.
0	2	2	The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, "I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, "At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship." Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends.
0	2	2	The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's "as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's "growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that "family". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's.
0	2	2	The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the "simple house" into the "traditional Cuban home" was shocking. The parents played the "Passionate Cuban music." and "a love of cooking" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring.
0	2	2	The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a grateful, cheery tone. As Narciso talks about his parents' Cuban background and tradition, by his tone you can tell how proud and happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his "@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"
0	2	2	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house. And how it is. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music and the scent of cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family
0	2	2	The mood created in the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 is happy & warm. The memoir is happy & warm because it describes how a small home & be very happy like in paragraph @NUM1, it says "always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love." This shows that love fills the air which is happy. That is how the author creates a mood.
0	2	2	The mood created by this @CAPS1 is, It makes the reader think About his family And what they have sacrificed for you. And ot makes you feel warm @CAPS2 It makes you think of family and friends. And your culture. And It also makes you @CAPS3 thinking of All the @CAPS4 your family has to make for you. And It Also makes you happy @CAPS2 It makes you think About all the fun you And your family has together. All In All It's A great @CAPS5 that makes you feel a flood of emotions @CAPS2 It makes you think of the best thing on earth, family And friends.
0	2	2	The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration.
0	2	2	The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a "melting pot". There are @CAPS1, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created by the authour in the memoir, is the idea of sacrifice and generosity. @PERSON1's parents came to @LOCATION1 as immigrants from Cuba and by doing this took a very risky and difficult journey in order to make @PERSON1 have a more successful life. The parents gave up seeing their families, friends and careers in the country they loved. Narciso displays generosity by saying "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms and I could feel the environment around me. He gave of a feeling of gratefulness when he explained how grateful he was to his parents for sacraficing everything and how much he appreciates everything they have done for him. He showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author was that how in the beggining it was a medium normal tune because he was Just describing who he was and where he lived and what his life was like. Then towards the medium and end in changed alot in my perspective. That it changed to a sad tone because not That his life was hard also how gratful he was. And how his Parents seemed like great people. for everything they did with him. That I got This answer by the beggining and ending of the story of how sad his life was but he seemed to make the best of things and said he had a good time and or everything he did. Thats my opinion and answer to the story.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy, and proud to of grown up in Cuba. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything. For example, "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). The mood created by the author was a great mood.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt. The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them. He was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did. He admired his parents and what they did. He will never forget growing up and living in that house. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what there parents did when they immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author is in the memoir. The mood of the memoir is that he always be grateful to his parents and he will love his parents and sacrifice. Memoir told his parent that of the admiration for the strength and perseverance and thank them repeadedly. He said that he would never forget his parent that turned this simple house into a home. That the mood of the author in the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him. For example in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says "I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home." To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says "I learned there about how to love". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in. the memoir were changing all through the book. In the begining he feels normal explaining his life and how important his parents are to him. When he explaines how important his parents are to him, he feel greatful and happy for all thing his parent impacted his life. In the middle of the memoir he explaininig how his life is like how he like how he came out in life. At the end he is looking back at his life as a little kid and how he has improved his life.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this... memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1, wrote this memoir for his parents. He wanted to portrey that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree. He reailzes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people. Like @PERSON1 said, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy, grateful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice" In paragraph @NUM2 "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture." @CAPS1 therefore I say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy, grateful.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy and loving. The author resortes to specific things she loves it remembers, such as her parents, family and friends. She also explains her past with such detail and care. When she explains the kitchen she talks about the music and the aromas and all the love of her parents. When she talked about he friends she mentioned Alegria her neghbor, baby sitter and first friend. The author talks about how her parents let friends and family in so often that it was a close-knit comunity and everyone cared and loved each other.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is happiness. According to the last sentence were @PERSON1 says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means that the mood is very happy and that this mood is great. @PERSON1 has many memories of the home that are positive and he also learned from what his parents taugh him. This mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about good memories and bonds between friends and family. Such as, when they first moved from cuba to the unided states to start their lifes new.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, "I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home." @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for his parents giving him a loving home in @LOCATION1. The author created a mood that the reader should be thankful for their parents. The sacrifice and love of anyones parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood of the story was happiness. The reason why I said that the story was happiness was because she was happy that she was growing up. In the text it says "Growing up in this environment instilled in me great sense". Narciso Rodriguez was happy she grew up in the neighborhood she lives in. Her neighbors/friends were from Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. In conclusion that was the mood of the authors memoir of the article/story.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir. He felt @CAPS1 and curious my mother and father Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved they struggled both personally and financially, braving the Harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless. They always helped out people in need. The author loved how he grew up with his cuban culture and how he would never forget it. He said that was one house hold he would never forget.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was the love your home and all of the people around it. The author is gratefull for all of the skills that her parents taught her like cooking, which she said that she was grateful for and also music. She loves to cook and listen to cuban music. She also loves all of the people around her home and how they all came together in unison even though they were all different cultures. She is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life. That is what I think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love. for his family and the people @CAPS1 him. Especially his parents who came to @LOCATION1 from cuba. And At first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future. Love for his culture that came from cuba with the music and food. And most of all the place he had called home Not the space, but everything and everyone @CAPS1 him.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's talking about his life and his greatfuless to have been raised in @LOCATION1. Also the mood was happy, because he said "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home. Those with the moods of the story
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was love. One way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his man had let in other immigrants to their house. Also a way that this was expressed was by saying that his parents selflessly left Cuba to get a better life for their children. Furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a home. This is the mood that the author created in the memoir
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood. The author shows how proud @CAPS1 was of his parents and how thankful @CAPS1 is. @CAPS1 also like His new enviroment, and his surprised how all the cultures fit together with No problem. @CAPS1 also explains how grateful @CAPS1 was to His parents for their love and sacrifice. In conclusion @CAPS1 was very proud and thankful to his parents.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that "'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your "family". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, "to give their children a better life." @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is, happy, proud of his parents and proud to be a Cuban. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he states "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." His parents gave up their wonderful jobs in Cuba and now are working jobs that they don't like. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says that this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with a blood relative. Narciso is grateful for his parents and grateful for being in @LOCATION1.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very positive. I believe that the mood is positive because in paragraph @NUM1 it says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." Also "I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly" @CAPS1 the whole memoir there is a lot of positiveness. That is the mood from the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very greatful and happy. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that his parents had good cooking skills and then notes that he is very greatful. So basically he is very greatful that he had or has a chance to life as @CAPS1 and have the opertunities that others don't have. And very, very happy that he did not just live in a house. his parents made it into a home with loving memories and his family moments.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he is proud of his family, their background, and the way he grew up. In the memoir, it says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." Narciso loves his parents and the way they raised him.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is used in lots of memoirs because they are like thing's: someone will never forget like the author said "my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. That's all stuff that he will never forget.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved." To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other alot family meant alot to the family. they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related. it doesnt matter. It's about Love and careness.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. "Warm homes" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills.In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like "warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, delightful, unique. I believe the author is happy because he/she is very grateful for the love of cooking his/her parents passed down to him/her. "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." I believe he's/she is delightful just the way he/she wrote the memoir. The words she/he used, the way he/she wrote them just sounds delightful to be who he/she is. The author sounds unique to me because he/she is just happy that he/she is Cuban and is happy with what he/she has. This is what I think the authors mood is in the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is grateful that his parents give up everything that they had just to give him a better life. In the memoir it says: "They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved." he is happy because he has an opportunity to have a better life and that he learned the real defition of family. In conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and good thoughts. Narciso tells us what it was like growing up. She gives us the idea that her and family were really close. She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking and so do her parents. She loves listening to Cuban music also. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home. Her home was not just a simple home, her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because on the second paragraph all he talks about how his parents made a simple home very traditional Cuban home, and the very heart was the kitchen. Also "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being blood relative." Also his parents sacrifice a lot to get at the point where there at now. This is why the mood of the memoir is happiness. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. 
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his cuban culture. Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home. That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memior. In paragraph @NUM1 it says "Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left ther homeland for the freedom of ther children. They gave up everthing including family for the kids. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was amazing. Jobs were few, money was sarce. Even though hard times, after there over, it's the best times of all. Family can be in a place with no relatives, That is the mood created by the autheor in the memoir
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describ how happy and upbeat his house was as a child. He does this by saying "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future. That is why the memoir has a happy mood.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very satisfactory mood. The author uses a satisfactory tone, too, especially when the author is explaining what a family is. Near the end of the memoir it has a very satisfactory mood, partly because it is near the end and they are ending the memoir, and also it is explaining what a family is. The mood of the memoir is also interesting because the author uses information of Narciso Rodriguez's life to help explain what a family is. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very satisfactory and interesting.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone. The reasons that its a happy tone is because @CAPS1 tells about her Childhood hapily by talking about the unity of his invirorment and the happiiness, cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he injoyes it so much.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love.
0	2	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir felt happy, and very greatful. In the memoir it tells how the author, Narciso Rodriguez feels "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice". which gives that he is so, so, so grateful and happy of his life, which makes the reason happy to hear that his parents sacrificed themselves for their children to have a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved.
0	2	2	The mood created by the auther in the memoir is that he was happy about his parence sacrinefying to what they wanted for themselfs and thinking about the family and what they needed. Also show them how @LOCATION1 is different from Cuba. They show him how to love because well his mother would invite people who can't find a job can stay there unil they can get back on there feet. This is how the author fells about the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir. First at the end of the memoir @CAPS2 was @CAPS3. "I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."@CAPS4 @CAPS3 one is, "it' was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my First birthday."My @CAPS6 mood that I am going to tell you about is like an I don't care. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "Family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."@CAPS7 are my moods created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir.
0	2	2	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. "In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why.
0	2	2	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this excerpt from his memoir "Home: The @CAPS1 of our lives" is a very comfortable one. He uses words like "warm" (@CAPS3 @NUM1), and "Close-knit" (@CAPS3 @NUM2). He shows us, how welcome his house was in @CAPS3 @NUM3, @CAPS2 "Countless family members came and went." In @CAPS3 @NUM4, he tells how his Family immigrated "Selflessly... to give their children a better life." And they did, because in @CAPS3 @NUM5 the author says "It was in the warmth of... this humble house... where I learned the real definition of 'family'."
0	2	2	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. the memoir explains how as a kid he didnt have much growing upas a kid but he did have family and he was extreamly greatful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the languge. When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have.
0	2	2	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez has a loving and caring feel to it. Since he is talking about his family of course he is going to @CAPS1 loving. For example he says "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends". This shows that he misses those times and he missed them he definetely cared about those times. So the mood created in the excerpt is loving and caring.
0	2	2	The mood I get from this article is that even though Narciso Rodriguez grew up in a time of rasicm that his parents did everything for him and he was greatful a few exampls are in paragraph @NUM1 it states "my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me theire rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and which I am internally greatul) then also in paragraph to there was a sentence that stated "passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..." @CAPS1 are only some of the exampls in this memoir called - "@PERSON1"
0	2	2	The mood Created by the author is @CAPS1. I @CAPS5 this because you can tell that the narrator doesn't take anything for granted. I know this because the @CAPS2 parents was given a house, and since @CAPS8 was part of the family, it was her duty to make that house a home as much as possible with her parents. I Know this because it @CAPS7 it in @CAPS3 @NUM1, and @NUM2.The author also gives a @CAPS4 mood in this memoir. I @CAPS5 this because in @CAPS3 @NUM1, and @NUM4 it @CAPS7 that @CAPS8 is Cuban and italian, from Newark, New Jersey, and @CAPS8 seems to be @CAPS4 of who @CAPS8 is and where @CAPS12 from. I know all of this is true because its all in the text.
0	2	2	The mood Created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share "Cooking duties and the work around the house." @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir.
0	2	2	The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. "And for which I am eternally grateful". "They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir!
0	2	2	The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes.
0	2	2	The main mood that is potrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood and he did. Narciso's parents turned a small apartment into a happy comforting place that people would go to for a happy reunion matter where they were from. The single force of staying over brought people together. That is how Narciso grew up with and with that was lucky and grateful.
0	2	2	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.
0	2	2	The author's mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving. he mentions a lot that his parents would let friends and @CAPS1 come eat at dinner table for because they would help the authors family in the long run. The mood shows that the author liked his home life growing up and that his family admired were they werer from.
0	2	2	The author was gratefull. His parents moved to america for him. so he could have a good education. He can't thank his parents enough for moving. He tells them how much courage they have and thanks so much for leaving their jobs. He also talks about home. How home is a place you learn to love and admire your relatives. It doesn't even matter if your blood related. He will love you either way.
0	2	2	The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story.
0	2	2	The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. The way he worded things such as "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home" Showed how happy he was toward his parents. He told us how greatful he was for his parents being so selfless and thinking about him first. He also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life. Also he shows how he admires his parents hard work and bravery for the things they have done. In conclusinon, His overal mood I think is his gratatude toward his parents.
0	2	2	The author of this story created quite a mood in these few paragraphs. As I read this I could feel a warm welcoming from home. The mood would have to be greatful and happy. Feelings of which we are expected to feel on @CAPS1. The author talks about his kind parents and loving family. About how his parents was so selfless, and would always lend a hand to anybody needed help, matter who they were. He also talked about his loving neighborhood, and not blood related families. I believe the author created a great mood that reminds you of home and makes your heart smile.
0	2	2	The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures "came together in great solidarity and friendship." @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir.
0	2	2	The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez made the @CAPS1 feel happy and welcome. When he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the @CAPS1 feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are. When he talked about his Culture and house and having people over for dinner everynight just felt happy and welcome. When he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the @CAPS1 feel uplifting. that is how Narciso Rodriguez created @CAPS1 in the memoir, by talking about happy uplifting topics.
0	2	2	The author mood in the memoir sound gratefun and very happy. This @CAPS2 that he was greatful because Cuba music and he sound like love to write about his @CAPS1 life. One example is in the article he was greatful of his parent's for what they did. Because his parent's work financially to get where they are, This also @CAPS2 that he was happy of meeting his neigh bor hood. One example is because he said They where all family To Them. Another example was he felt warm because of that. He love what his parent's did.
0	2	2	The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. The author "admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly." overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish.
0	2	2	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace.

He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside.
0	2	2	The author definatly created a mood when he wrote the memoir. The mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents love of him had them leave their countries and come to the US. Because they loved him and wanted him to have a good life they left Cuba, everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had, and started all over. Their families love turned the house into the home he loves. They brought the culture of Cuba into their new home with decorations and "the very heart of which was the kitchen. The memoir's mood is the love of the author's parents to him.
0	2	2	The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and freinds that surroud you every single day.
0	2	2	The author creates a very warm mood and inviting mood that makes you want to feel relaxed and comfortable. Here are the ways he creates it. He describes the kitchen and how his family loves to cook and entertain. He says that his parents have welcomed refugees to stay at the house that sets a welcomeing mood and that the parents care for their friends and family. To his family the word "family" means anyone it's important to remember that because a family could be anyone. That's how the author sets the mood.
0	2	2	The author creates a very warm happy welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time. The author Narciso Rodriguez never mentions any bad times and shows how kind everyone is. This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story."The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This quote i think shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir.
0	2	2	The author creates a mood of grateful rememberance. The auther is looking back at the place where he grew up and is recalling how loving and open his parents were to a world that tried to hold them back. He is grateful to his parents for teaching and showing him the definition of family, and of how to cook, and an appreciation of culture and openess.
0	2	2	The author creates a mood in this memoir. The author starts off with a mood that is kind of sad. He explains how his parents lived in a one-room apartment when they moved from Cuba to the United States and that there was a lot of segregation going on in the United States. The memoir gets happier as the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how friendly and close the people living around him were. The hardships of the author's parents are listed in paragraph @NUM2. The fact that they had to start all over again is sadening. The author finishes of in paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 with a happy ending. He describes what he has learned from his parents and everything he is grateful for. For example, he learned the true meaning of "family". The mood that the author creates is very important to the memoir.
0	2	2	The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says," I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness.
0	2	2	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly @CAPS1) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parens brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had.
0	2	2	The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solodalriy and friendship." This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir.
0	2	2	The author created a joyful mood. The author said, "growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative." he talks about how people are close and they dont have to be related to be conciderd family. The authour says "my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the coltur." The author is proud of his parents for doing that, that takes alo of courage.
0	2	2	The author could have put alot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, greatful and appreciated. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story.

The mood that @CAPS1 mostly had was happy and greatfull for having his family and friends near him. @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 didnt have his granparents with him @CAPS1 said "I would not know my real grand parents Narciso the Elder and consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba." @CAPS1 was happy that his parents that his parents left everything for him to have a better life.

Him saying that @CAPS2 can't even show How grateful @CAPS2 is in that ther selfless shows his thankful and loving mood
0	2	2	The @CAPS1 made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story. It's nice because of the actual story of the family moving to @LOCATION1, and establishing their own home. The family didn't just live with themselves, it was like all of their friend were like brothers and sisters nobody was excluded from their "family". It's motivating because of even if you wern't in their race, they would still lend a hand for people clearly in need. Everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was. Everybody just cared and love for eachother like parents, brothers and, sisters. The mood in this memoir was it had a nice feeling and it was a motivating story.
0	2	2	The @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS3 very happy and always like they are doin something as a family. it shows this in @CAPS4 @NUM1 throughout the whole thing. it shows that @CAPS5 it shows how he is @CAPS6 much as close to his family as he is to the others around him. and that should mean a lot of things @CAPS5 he really doesnt know much english and all those people are goin to be an important influence on his life As an @CAPS8 and non-Cuban, that is how and where it shows @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2.

The love and meaning of family.
0	2	2	It was a very high up, cheerful mood. It made me feel as if I was there. In paragraph @NUM1 it said "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home". That means he thanks his parents for all the hard work they did. The @CAPS1 they made. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it said "my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture". He is proud of his parents on coming from their country and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard. All in all it was a very high up, cheerfull mood.
0	2	2	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.
0	2	2	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didnt have the parents and oppurtunities he did then, his life would have been much different. So, the mood in this poem makes you feel like home is where the heart is.

And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.

The author is so happy that she is moving to a new, and bigger house. This one she can actually call home. And very generous because her parents moved for her education. and to get good money to make us happy. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and thats why she loves them too. But I have to say she's mostly grateful. Because her parent's are doing every thing to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they dont even like. And for their love and sacrifice. And that's what mood the author feel's in the story.
0	2	2	In the short story of @PERSON1, there is a very happy mood. The story has a lot of examples of how his family was so nice.

0	2	2	In the short story "Narciso Rodriguez" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez twenty-seven years old migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else. But Narciso was being very greatful. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph @NUM1. @CAPS1 says "They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters." @CAPS1 had to settle for what was given to him at the time.
0	2	2	In the memoir, the author definatly creates a mood that you can obviously see. He creates a mood of friendship in pharagraph @NUM1, "our land lord and his daughter (my baby sitter and first friend), lived a bove us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not." Also a feeling of love in pharagraph @NUM1 (again), "there was often somone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet." The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in pharagraph @NUM3, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice". Therefore, the overall mood is his appriciation for his family.
0	2	2	In the memoir, the author creates lots of moods. First of all, the author creates this mood that makes you want to cry. While there is a kind of Love mood here. Narciso loves his home because that's where he grew up and he cherished it. Also, Narciso is graceful that he got the chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. Finally, he's happy that he has a Cuban culture and that he has good caring parents. The author has good moods.
0	2	2	In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents. For example in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, "My mother and father come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life. I would feel just as grateful For my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt.
0	2	2	In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love.

One way it is a stress is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they move from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States which they never gave up until the day that they finally had enough money to live here.

0	2	2	In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is gratefulness. Mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words. I think that it is happyness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always gratfull. She does not care if she lives in a simple house with a bunch of people, she is happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." I would have looked up to her, for being this gratfull and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." These are a perfect example of the mood, greatfullness, and some of happyness.

Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him In paragraph @NUM1, "... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)" @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1.
0	2	2	In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to a blood relative." @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. "I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.

This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family.

Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. In the very last sentence it is noticeable. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
0	2	2	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, "the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven.
0	2	2	In the memoir of "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say "thank you" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. It also states that "there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are." Over all, in the memoir of @PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home.
0	2	2	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a serious, happy and thankful mood. The author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems. However, the author was happy how they lived in a friendly and unified neighborhood with other immigrant from different countrys. The author showed thankfulness because his parents worked so hard to give him a new life. The memoir showed a good mood as well as a accurate portrait of the athour childhood.
0	2	2	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez gives her own definition of "family". In paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 that she adores the cuban cooking, and music. In paragraph: three, she states that her neighborhood were all family and they were all close. Stated in paragraph four, her parents would have everyone over (anuts, cosins, land lord ect). She also States that her parents would let people (family) stay with them until they could get back on there feet. Narciso parents seem like good parents, and she has a nice nieghbor hood When she was younger.
0	2	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" there was a mood to the memoir. The mood that was set was about how you should keep peace in the house. You should be grateful and appresitive to what your parents do for you and what they give you.Another mood that was set is to keep yoar house open to family and friends. And hope they would do the same for you. And no matter if your poor or have a small house "family" is always there. And family "can turn a simple house into a home"
0	2	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" the mood is kind of happy, sad and is greatful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend time with "family" and is also very happy that his family hes with him and that more family will come from cuba in a few years. He is sad because he cant see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him. He is greatful for being alive for his parents doing everything for him bringing him to @LOCATION1 and he's greatful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents. That was the mood of the memoir.
0	2	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" is a clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 with all different immagrets. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. "Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." (@NUM1). He had a: "Close-Knit community of honest, hard working immigrants.." (@NUM1). I think Narciso would be a clothing designer if he didnt grow up with these people.
0	2	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" he expresses his gratitude toward his family. He describes why he is so thankful to have a neighborhood that is united together.Narciso Rodriguez includes a happy mood. He points out all of the positivities of his life. "I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrafice." (@CAPS1 @NUM1) this is a quote showing that he'll do as much as he can to prove how lucky he is.

0	2	2	In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood the author created in the memoir was a mood that made you feel like you were at home.The mood that the author created with the mood that made you feel like you are at home. One quote from the memoir that helped set the mood was "Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing withe the aromas of the kitchen."The second thing that @PERSON2 mentioned that also helped set the mood was "Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that "familly" nothing to do with being a blood relative.I conclusion the mood that @PERSON2 created was to make you feel like you wer at home. Thats @CAPS1 set the mood. 
0	2	2	In the excerpt from the memoir "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives," by Narciso Rodriguez he has a specific mood or feeling throughout the whole excerpt. He mood seemed to be kind of like a happy mood that shows everything even the hard times like "a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed the United States," in a happy tone or mood. He even explained how his parents left their country and friends to live here and have warre jobs in a lighter happier mood. I believe that Narciso Rodriguez likes to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what it is.
0	2	2	In the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child. The mood of this story is happy because he tells how selflessness his parents were and how his family always looked out for one another even though they werent the richest family they still stuck together. In paragraph @NUM1 it says how the teachings have stuck with him his whole life and how import family and his friends were to him which creates a warm setting.
0	2	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso really sets, a joyous, happy mood when @CAPS1 describes his home. @CAPS1 gives the reader a feeling of just how much @CAPS1 loved his home. @CAPS1 sets a mood of gratefulness as well, when @CAPS1 describes how much is parents sacrificed for him to grow up well. "There is no way for me to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are." @CAPS1 sets such an ecstatic mood, that the reader wants to be there, at his home. This is a mood that Narciso Rodriguez sets, and the way @CAPS1 shows the reader just how great his home really is.
0	2	2	In "Narciso Rodriguez from "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" there is a proud, happy mood. This memoir is all about heritage and the home. When he talks about his heritage he speaks about his food, home, and music that gives the reader a sense of pride. This is also a happy sort of memoir because it talks about the unity of the neighborhood despite the fact that they are all from different parts of the world,
0	2	2	I would say the mood that the author was in was happy. I would say that because he always has something nice to say. He never gets into fights with his mother or father. He talks about how he is grace full. how he would never agure with his parents. How he's  always had a good life from when he was a kid to now when he is an @CAPS1. He was going to move into A new @NUM1 bedroom apartment soon. That way he can call It his home.
0	2	2	I was in this simple house that myparents welcomed other refugees to celebratetheir arrival to this country and whenI celebrated my first birthday. I was in thewarmth of the kitchen in this humblehouse where a cuban  feast always filledthe air with not just scent and love.It was here where i learned thereal definition of family And for this,I will never forget that house or its,I will never forget that house or it's graciousneighborhood or the many things i learnedthere how to love, I never forget this house.
0	2	2	I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved. An example of his satisfaction is "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the to life in our home." And an example of his thankfulness is "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today..." And lastely an example of him being loved is "Growing up in this enviorment instilled me a great sense that "family" had nothing to do with being a blood relative." I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well.
0	2	2	I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home.In a @NUM1 bedroom, two family house in @LOCATION1's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of cooking hapened in the house. Family was always around which must've been fun, and all of this hapening with Cuban music playing in the back ground. "@CAPS1 the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his home seem like a very loving home.
0	2	2	I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 "I've thanked them repeatedly" I believe this meas that @CAPS2 is thank full that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 "I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about.
0	2	2	I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy. In the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times.
0	2	2	I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end. Such as "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason is that his friends and family is all he got. Such as "...how important family and friends are. Also because he had to move, so he didnt no anybody. Such as "...Originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956.
0	2	2	I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them.
0	2	2	I think that there is a warm mood in the memoir. I think so because in the memoir, the author is talking about how thankful he is to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 destpite the hardships that they faced. Also, there is a warm mood to this memoir because the author is reminiscing about his past with sense a fondness for his parents and his neibhors. "Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." In the memoir, the author often talks about how kind the people he grew up with were, and how good of a childhood he had. This is why I think the mood of this memoir was warm.
0	2	2	I think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude. I think this @CAPS1 his parents "unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @CAPS1 they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better. This shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness
0	2	2	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because @CAPS1 someone imagrate from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws this community or neighborhood will take you in. this community is made up of Cuban spanyards and italians all have left there homelands to persue a better life for either them, the family, for there kids In conclusion the mood of this memoir is happy because it is enlightening and welcome place to be.
0	2	2	I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the athor is talking about his first friend (land loards daghter) the great cooking and music that his home had. how greatful he is to his parents for moving to america for him, all the celibrations they had for people, how everybody in the naborhood were friends, and much he loved his family. What about that is unhappy
0	2	2	Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends.
0	2	2	Based on the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by: Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 designer. The mood created by the author in memoir is happy. You can tell that the mood is happy because throughout the memoir the author tells about all the good times that they had in their house in Newark, New Jersey. The author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there. He/@CAPS2 also tells about how their was always cuban music and cuban food. They used to have fun at that house. That's how you can tell that the mood is happy.
0	2	2	Based on the excerpt of the "@PERSON1" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter.
0	2	2	A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood.
0	2	2	@PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were. Not just to him but to almost anybody. Anyone that was considered family was allowed in and he was also grateful to be Cuban and for the foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas in his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of. It is a tempting place to attend life in this make the best of" little Cuban home."
0	2	2	@PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful & shows a lot of appriciation torwards his parents. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story.
0	2	2	@PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood. One example of this was when he said that he was forever grateful of his families Cuban cooking.Another example of this mood was when he was getting excited over the fact that his whole immigrants neighborhood was lending out a helping hand even if you had a different @NUM1  also portrayed greatfulness by how that even though he hasn't met his real grandparents, that someone in the neighborhood supplanted them and treated @PERSON1 like a grand-child. That is the mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family.
0	2	2	@ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congression of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes." This quote uses words like celebrations and warm to show that this place was a comforting place that always had a great time. This shows how Narciso Rodriguez created this warm, comforting mood."

0	1	1	I think the @CAPS1 was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still around his Cuban culture. His parents put him in @LOCATION1 I think because they wanted to live there and start a family. That is why I think that this is the mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir.
0	1	1	I think that the mood that the author created was a unpleasnt. One beccause he lived in a one room apartment so that must mean that they are poor. and that they live in a poor town without any food.
0	1	1	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live.

0	1	1	I the exerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives There is a specific mood set on the exerpt I think its love and @CAPS1. for example in paragraph @NUM1 it says "I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays."
0	1	1	He was happy to be educated like he is and he was happy to be Cuban and even though his parents didn't have much he was still proud of his family because is not where you live or in what conditions is. If you are from an honest family and if they're with you in the hard moments.
0	1	1	Based on the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the @CAPS1 is trying to re-create his/her past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family, such as "It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home."
