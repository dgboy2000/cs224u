2	17	15	A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @CAPS1 the party came I got all my presents’ exept the ones from my parents. They said @CAPS1 everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left till ten. So I fell asleep. When I wook up no one was up. So I still had to wait. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up. @CAPS1 my dad finally got up (@NUM1) I finally got to open my presents. It was worth the wait.
0	17	17	A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. I was super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were geting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride they steped us because the ride wasen’t working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckly my best firend and I had good patients unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experences of my life. “I’m so happy we waited” said @PERSON1 my best firend. Some people have patient like  @PERSON1 and I, and some don’t like the the people who ran of there. I’m glade we waited or that would not have happened. In this case patient was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I.
1	19	20	Last @DATE1, while I was up at my families within my seep dad, taught my brothers, friends and I how to wares. It being the dareful am not really, I tied first. Using all the steps my step dad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue [literally, we were on a lake] I got up on my skills just like @CAPS1! No I could make all! In when the water level end came around and I brought my boat up to the cabin. I insisted her to cry water at ring. But when we got out to the lake, and I had skilled a few times in a lowest was up to here to decide if she was going to try skilling for sure. We sat there for what seems hill an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn’t try to persuade was of pitch him into trying it. I was very patience with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I will not proud of myself to this day, for what I did on that boat.
3	17	20	As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all walking by I pondered these thoughts in my head: “when will @CAPS2 be here?” @CAPS1 long have I been waiting and what time is it, wasn’t his flight supposed to be here @NUM1 minutes ago? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice ‘@CAPS2 will be here soon, honey dont worry.’ I dont understand @CAPS1 my mother told a @NUM2 year old not to worry it was in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself ‘what good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.’ @CAPS3 these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. ‘I almost lost my patient’ @CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I wasn’t it would’ve ruined my fathers trip. Patience is a good thing to have, you can gain or lose things from it. In this case I think I gained something.
2	22	24	Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up keep trying and your will succeed, rush through life and become impatient and you used and succed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. ""@CAPS1 year in the fall a big race takes place. All the animals in the @CAPS2 come to the. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that @CAPS1 year, one slow animal and one first around commute to see who is this up is champion. At the time the @CAPS5 was the fastest @CAPS2 around. @CAPS11 signed up @CAPS1 year and won @CAPS1 time. The @CAPS15 had signed up to complete this year. @CAPS11 was very wat don't in himself and was had to pride that @CAPS12 because @CAPS11 was about, slow and @CAPS11 can't be a champion. ""runners get ready!"" shouted the announcer. The @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! "" @CAPS5 rushed ahead kicking the air. For the @CAPS15 very slowly waiting behind. @CAPS5 run like @CAPS11 has never won. @CAPS11 never looked back. @CAPS11 wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his any ways. Right? I mean, @CAPS11 was the fastest animal. @CAPS15 continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS6 ."" @CAPS5 stopped and looked around. No one was around. ""@CAPS9 is that noise?"" @CAPS11 asked aloud. ""@CAPS6"" it came from his stomach @CAPS11 was so caught up in the race @CAPS11 didn't realize how hungry @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS12 one little handful of berries."" @CAPS11 decided. @CAPS11 picked a handful, then another and another. Finally @CAPS11 was full and a little bit sleepy. ""I'll @CAPS12 take a little nap after all that @CAPS15 ain't gonna catch up anyways."" @CAPS11 laid down and slept. Little did @CAPS5 know that the whole time @CAPS11 was eating and napping, @CAPS15 was catch up? @CAPS11 saw the @CAPS5 sleeping and decided but to wake him @CAPS12 to case @CAPS11 was sick is @CAPS11 continued to slowly very slowly walk up the hill to the inish line. @CAPS5 woke to the sound or cheering. @CAPS11 stood up. The @CAPS15 won! @CAPS11 raced to the finish line but was to late, the @CAPS15 had already won. If @CAPS11 had been patient @CAPS11 might have won.
2	15	17	Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people can’t be patient. For example my brother. If he orders something online or is wait for dinner be perparred he always has to be winey of when he’s going to get what he wants. I’m not like that. I actully have patience. For example I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, I was so excited, I waited and waited. After three day I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn’t drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was comeing home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on @DATE1 but since you were patient they came early.
1	16	17	One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I don’t want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, I’m not sorle years old, I’m muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying “your mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said “was you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story.
4	16	20	About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except driving four hours in car with older & younger siblings in the car. It was lould, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient. When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes later… I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasn’t worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride  move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient.
2	17	15	(waiting) (healt beatina ) “@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your repolt cords”. said @PERSON2hemlock. I @PERSON1 was the last one in line. “@CAPS3 you go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12, keepup the good work!” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS4!!!!” I said screaming happily I ran home going straitght A’@CAPS12” “@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1.” @CAPS7 mom aya said . I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 saying, “@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12! but can I older something from the internet for @MONEY1?” “@CAPS13 why not for a @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12 tudent. I placed @CAPS7 order and I waited @NUM1 week it…???
0	24	24	The four sisters waited in line the second most exciting ride of their days at cedar point. Right behind @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed by @CAPS14 it started to get quit again. “I am soon super, doper excited!”  @CAPS4 the youngest sister ???. “ I know me to.” The rest said at almost the same time. Eight hard eyes moved at the same time watching the same thing. The @CAPS5! There were twists, torirs, diues, and hills involved with  this serious packages deal. “@CAPS6”. @CAPS10 long has it been?!” ??? @PERSON3. “@CAPS7 hour.” @CAPS8 the oldest, ???, putting her long, dark, curiy hair into a pony tail. “@CAPS9 young grasshopper” said @PERSON4 has the petteel the side of??? face, “@CAPS10 this son has really got to me “@CAPS11!” agreed @PERSON1 with a look of displeasure on her face. “@CAPS12 my ??? guys look! Were almost to the front!” exclaimed the second oldest @PERSON2. “@CAPS13 me!” said a voice coming from??? abuse. “@CAPS14 you for being patient, but we are experiencing some difficulty with the ride and it will be fixed as soon as we ran. Thank you.”  “ I really hope @CAPS15 finish it soon!” said @PERSON3. ‘@CAPS15 all agreed. @CAPS15 waited for about a half @CAPS7 hour @CAPS14 another anouncement came on. “@CAPS16 again thank you for being so patient but this problem will not be fixed for another @NUM1 hours. Thank you for choosing cedar point.” And the voice shut off and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, go ride the grant swings.
6	18	12	One time I was patient was last year when I was at a amusment park in @LOCATION2 callnt cedarpaint. I was slunting in line to get to get on a amazing lollermaster called the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 force. It was a very tuff ride and delitedly ?? in the ?? but it was ten hours long. Standing in the hot unbearableline hurts ,horid, ussually when in @LOCATION1
1	15	16	One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1 to see jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2 as we where travelling  we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there . Then we seen a sign  that says “you are how leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said you are how entering @LOCATION1 and that’s when  it happened the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m how smart was that not very but the worst part was the waiting I t  lasted for hours just sitting there but we found ways to away ourselves. Like watch the sea @PERSON2’s ,waves, and  look at the buildings there. That’s my example of patience.
1	23	24	We climbed in the rental car waving goodbye to realitives as we drive back to the airport. “I can’t believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us? Exclaimed my @CAPS4. “@CAPS1 I can’t either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport smelling that strafoam smell, and checked in our bags. “@CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 explained to the clerk “@CAPS5 sorry according to this your @CAPS10 is full” she told us through a chessy smile. “@CAPS6 you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2.” “@CAPS5 sorry @CAPS6 it wouldnt be fair if we gave away @CAPS2 that were rightful owned.” @CAPS8 again another chessy smile “@CAPS6 you can have your orginal @CAPS2 back if you like,” @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By @NUM4 I knew the place inside out. Soon it time to leave suddenly the speaker came on @CAPS10 @NUM5 to @LOCATION2 has been deylayed by an hour and a half” @NUM6 now really? Luckly my @CAPS4 took me to an extotic restraunt. Beautiful restraunt soon it was time to leave. Please don’t get delayed again?! It wasn’t. I felt happy that we finally left @CAPS8 sad. I learned a great lesson about patience! It’s not hard @CAPS6 not impossible.
1	14	15	Patience is about waiting for something for a long  time. If you have patience that is good for you here is a time where i had patience. Last year in @DATE1 after school my dad and I went hunting for deer in @CAPS1. He went to this homeguards blind that we found sat in chair waiting for a deer to come along. You have to have patience while going  hunting . We didn’t see anything but then a deer came along and my dad he got ready and he said “cover your ear” then he shot  but we didn’t see any sign of deer blood  so he must have missed,then we packed up and went home.That is the time i had patience to go hunting with my dad but we didn’t get anything though.
1	18	19	Once upon a time there was a young girl named @CAPS1 she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was almost her birth and she was so exited for this birthday because she was turning twelve. Twelve was here luckey number ever sience she was little. Her mom said they could go into town and go to chef @PERSON1 and eat out she agreed so that morning she woke up and dad made her some pancakes with fresh strawberrys on them she went out to go milk there cows for her parents. @CAPS1 hated milking there cows because they are very stuburn so she went out there and miked the cows in only @NUM1 minetts. @CAPS1 went back inside and put the milk on the table. @CAPS1 was starting to wonder if she was going  to get a birthday present, @CAPS1 decided it would be best if she was patient when her mom came home from work (she works at a dress making store) she said, “Are you ready to go eat,” @CAPS1 jumped “And yeld yes, yes. So they rode in to town and parked at the restaurant, they walked in and the lights are off her dad got the light switch and all of her cloose family and friends where there and they yelled “sprise” @CAPS1 was is such a shock she yelled “@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, and on a table was twelve presents, and under the table was a dog. Her mom & dad got her a dog. She name the dog wonder because every time she saw him she began to wonder about her  wonderful life. And she learned that great thing come when you are patient.

3	24	21	Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office.
1	22	21	Once apon a time, in a land for army, there was a girl named @PERSON1. One day @PERSON1 and her mom where going to watch a movie called @CAPS1 from @LOCATION1. @CAPS2 when they got to the theater, the tickets were sold and so they had to watch another movie. It must’ve been a bad day because once they got up to the ticket sold and remember to go to! @PERSON1 and her mom left and went to go eat. They went to a place called @ORGANIZATION1 and got in to order! They ordered their food, sat back down and ate. Once they were done, the left and went to try again with the movie @CAPS2 when they did the line was as long as a mile! @PERSON1’s mum just told her to be patient and wait I told about and listening to go???. When they were there, they finally got the last ticket available. After that her mom @CAPS5 “so honey @CAPS3 were patient???When they got home???  the couch, got a snack, and waited for @PERSON1’s sister and dad to get home. finally, they ???  withe a big surprise  and @PERSON1’s dad was holding tickets to go see the movie @PERSON1 and her mom had just seen! “@CAPS3 were trying to find you all day” @CAPS5 her father. “@CAPS4 @CAPS3 couldn’t find you.” @CAPS5 her sister. @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and explained that they can go see the movie @CAPS3 were patient and waited in line an got the last ticket available!” “And @CAPS3 won feifty dollars too!” exclaimed @PERSON1. The @CAPS6!
2	21	19	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months –old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when “her baby,” @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it.
3	13	10	I asked my mom if I can get a phone but she said no, not yet. She said I cant have one till @NUM1 grade unless I get a @CAPS1 phone write now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone. I told her okey. But when are you going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I will but when she said as soon as possible like on @DATE1 . I said I’ll be patient till then and will not bug you about it. That’s one time I had to be patient.
2	11	13	People with patients are great teachers my mom is one of those great leader she has a great level of patients she has a family and many responsibilities. When we  ask for things over and over again she doesn`t get angry and out bust she just says no or yes you @MONTH1 with a smile or when she comes home from a long day at work. She never complains she just keeps a smile on her face and finishes the rest of the adventures day. When she wakes up in the morning to take us to school she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains. My mom is very patient women and a great teacher and leader. I apreciates everything she does for me, my brother, and dad.
0	21	21	Once upon a time there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was abnovius and always had to time it his way. @PERSON1 always waited his turn with something and shared. One day while watching @CAPS1.V. they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad they wanted it. His dad called the phone ??? and ???, I it ??? it world take @CAPS2 weeks.

Eventually the day came. @ORGANIZATION1 ran out and picked his rocket up ???. In that time @PERSON1 ??? out the door. When to the of them had the rockets ??? they opened them up. @ORGANIZATION1 was disapointed because he wanted to play now but first he had to build it. @PERSON1 took his time doing step by step instructions and no time his rocket was done. @ORGANIZATION1 just cramed pieces together and came out crooked and broke. @ORGANIZATION1 yelled landly. @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and told he would help and in @NUM1 minutes they finished.

That was when I was being patient.

2	17	19	We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then dissappered. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until we’ve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food.

3	10	7	I chose to write a story in my own way about patients. Patients is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant you be patient and wait for your food. In an airplane waiting area you be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure. Those are the things I know about patience.
2	14	16	‘’@CAPS1’’ my name is @CAPS2 ?? and this is a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight years old my mom said that she would take me to the fair that day. so after lunch we went to the rain I wanted to ride the biggest ride there so we had to wait in line for it ?? line was very long so I had to be patient to get on the ride. I did not want to wait in line so half of the time in line I was complaining but ??the line was not that long and l have to be patient. I am glad I was patient because the ride was?? Of fun. That day l walked that was good to be patient. I told my ?? I will never be unpatient again. That was the story?? The time l had to be patient at their??
2	6	8	@PERSON1 is waiting patient when the class is talking. I the class closet at ping she will clap third time until they stop talking or quiet. When they quiet down she would continue teaching then??? @PERSON1 is talking we should be waiting patient and untill she is down talking to us. That is how @PERSON1 be patient.
2	22	24	I sat there, staring off into the distance waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back to my chair and propped my head toward the ceiling. I tried my best to clear my head and be paitient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for celar paint’s @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimates at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us. “@CAPS1 is this taking so long?!” I said impatiently. “@CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?” “@CAPS3.”  I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of being patient. We looked at the ride and hopped on. Patience really pays off. I learned to be patient with all sorts of things.
0	14	14	Being patience is when someone could be bisy is just better to be patience while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patience. Well on one morning my mom had got out of work when she came I told my mum that I really wanned to go over my friends house. But my mom just keept on saying to wait and so I had to wait so I did? My mom wasn’t even done still so I told her if I could go working to my friends house. But she said no and that I had to be patience till she was done. My dad was living to his work in the afternoon so I had an idle. I told my dad if he could drop me off my friends house and then he could live to his work. So I did I went to tell him. But guess what he said no coz he was already late and I looked at the time and yhea he was already late so I dicided to just be patience coz my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched tv while my mom was done. My mum had went insid the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said “yes” I so yelled so you are tackeing me and so she did I was so happy I rushed to the car and so we went and I went and my mom had left and that was the day I got to go to my friends house for just being patience.
2	17	19	Patience is something is most people don’t have. In the story, patience was something that I needed. If I didn’t have patience in the story, I don’t know what I would do. This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I don’t, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasn’t out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didn’t let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasn’t mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story.
2	19	17	It was my first game. I was pumped ready to go in, coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said next play you re going in. Ther the assistant said no I wasn’t aloud to. The whole time I didn’t complain. I never said one word to anyone. I helped other people. It was still fun. The whole time at least I didn’t complain and make it worth for everyone else. The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn’t mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine. That one stupid word stood in my way no. But at least I learned something.
4	15	11	One day I was at basketball practice and I was running has  with my team when I was getting really really thirsty  do after we did are suicides (a running exercise)I asked coach if we could go get  some drinks  coach said “after are double drible down and back exercise” @CAPS1 I did the exercise and we all rushed to the drinking fountain and I was at the end of an @NUM1 girl  line .I waited and waited until finally there I was faced with that drinking fountain when one girl says “ can I have a drink thank you” and all I could do if be stunned..Thats were I heard a bright ladys lets go!” I was @CAPS1 mad but I quickly took a @NUM2 second drink of water and rushed over to coach and now I’m the fisst one alot and I take long drunks do my teammates call me a fish!

2	18	20	One of the worst fellings in the world is that your flight has been canceled .This has happens to many people but only one family in my family. My cousins were going to come to @LOCATION1 for chrismas. Cara and I where texting and e-mailing each other about what we where going to do while they where in @LOCATION1. They have been planning this since @DATE1, but now their night was conclled! We where so mad! My cousins family had to be so patence because they did not know if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle @LOCATION2. My grandma had a good idea, for them! To get on the next fight. The only problem was that the next flight was at @NUM1 and it would take I them two hours to get here. When they got here I was at the airport waiting .When I saw my cousin she said “everyone was so patient but me!” I expected the exact oposite but, no! I thought that my cousin, carn would be the patient one but I was wrong, but at least some one was pacient.
2	10	12	It was @DATE1, @NUM1 my brothers birthday. He turned @NUM2 and he was makeing me mad because he kept asking my mom for stuff and he kept saying no she dont have it. Then he would ask my brother be like you know I got this money for my baby. So he would keep asking people and it was getting on my nerves because when somebody say they dont have it they dont have it. I didnt say nothing I was quiet because it was his birthday but I know how to be patience when it’s something important or special. So I just was watching him and watching him and then I said here you can have my money it is your birthday so here you go. So I have gave him what he was angry and asking for and he got it I had patience because I didn’t go off him because it was his birthday and it gave him what he wanted.
1	16	15	The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours long wait. Bad news for me become I am definintaly not a patience person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There was only two people in line but I didn’t want to wait so I didn’t want one anymore. That’s how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this @ORGANIZATION1. Very mad I kept saying to myself it’s the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer
0	24	24	Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can’t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn’t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it’s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around.
0	5	5	Patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already exsited. But some time you are doing like if one of your family members is talking & you are waiting for something else that is patience
1	23	24	“@CAPS1 @CAPS8! Really?” it was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at @LOCATION1 pritz. The forcast was @CAPS8. @CAPS8 and @CAPS1 @CAPS8. The tigers were play the “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.” @PERSON1 was pitching for the @CAPS4 and justin @CAPS6 for the tigers. My dad + my mom and my brother and I were just two rows from the front row. It was the bottom of the first and I feel a huge drop of @CAPS8 touch my head. Then I feel another than another. “@CAPS7 upstairs for shelter!” my dad yelled. As soon as we got up in the selter area complete down poor. That’s all I have to say. The players went into the dugduts. My mom called my grand pa to see what the forecast is. “@CAPS8.” @CAPS9 said. My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said “its gonna be a long @TIME1 so rest up now” at first I didn’t understand. But after she explained to me I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2 so waiting is not really my thing. An hour past by it was still raining. @NUM3 hours, than, @NUM4, than finally 41/@NUM3 hours past by. It was @NUM6 at @TIME1! The game still wasn’t starting. My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there for ever! Me and my family were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. @NUM7 ½ hours later. It cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at @NUM8 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patiente. The game ended at @NUM9! we only stayed till @NUM4.00 though because of the drive. In the end I got to see an awesome baseball game (and get ice cream.) I learned patience pays off!
0	24	24	“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you.
4	19	15	I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My cousin was at my house and needed help on math homework. Because no one else was home, I had to help him. We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn’t know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teuch him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient.
1	15	14	My neighbor was very patient when he killed that @NUM1 point buck for the first time! He was??? and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbors’ face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer I’ve ever seen.
5	19	14	A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldn’t just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world.
3	18	15	My dad has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two kids, one that’s seven years old, and one that is four years old. The oldest one is @PERSON2, @CAPS1 loves to skateboard. The youngest one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is kind of a spaz and if you jumped out of a airplane, @CAPS1 would too. This one day @PERSON2 and I were going to go skateboarding at a park, @PERSON3 wanted to come but @CAPS1 didn’t even know how to ride a skateboard. @PERSON2 went over to the park and when we got there, @CAPS1 realized @CAPS1 didn’t have his skateboard. I had to let him use my skateboard ??? ???. I didn’t have a problem with him useing it, it’s just that I didn’t get to use it.
2	22	24	This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For “bragging rigts,”we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn’t play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like it’s the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadn’t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, ”can you do it?”I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!
1	8	9	This is a story about patience, pateince is when someone gives you a older or specific job to do.

Much got a fly shot and I had to wait in the lobby.

1	14	13	This is a story about a time I was patient. It was night time and all of a sudden wire from my  braces popped out of place. It was sticking out of my mouth and there was nothing  I could about it. I had to wait for my mom to get home and to to me but I was scared but I was patient.

Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal hands, finally, she asked me what color I wanted then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had patience.

4	20	24	Fishing is a great sports, but it takes a lot patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about @NUM1 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn’t easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient accomplishing what I did took every oune of patience I had. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1 he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a differently. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that  I should bring a friend. So if I get boared, I would someone to talk to.The patience started when we were about half way there and @CAPS1 ! We hit a fence. The car had broken down so we called a land break.The wait was about @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 min and my friend asked. So are and my friend sucked .We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way .Once we got there, we had two problem to fix, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to sea venge for some baits, which took about @NUM4 hours for enough baits.We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited.There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend ,and I caught @NUM5 fish ! We had eat three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened but we went fishing , relaxed, and brough a couple of meals. Thats why I have fishing because it requires patience.

The bus smelt good but same lady kept spraying  perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple snacks. I kept gettting woke up by a baby. Everytime  i hold to go to the  bathroom there was always someone in the bathroom. Also when i was trying to sleep every one seems to get louder. So when it was time to catch some  @CAPS1’@CAPS2 my bus driver would wake us up us and we would have to get off the bus to another bus. It seemed  like  never on that bus. You had to have alot of patients or you wouldn’t be able to to just relax when the day is done. I finally got there in @NUM1 days. It  was worth it because we went to six plags. If I didn’t have patience then the experience of being on a bus for @NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience.
0	8	8	Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then they’ll be able to sit and wait or there’s a really long wait or line. Or they’ll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That’s what patients mean to me in my own way.
2	14	16	I was @PERSON1  when l was about to have an allgen l sat and wait for @NUM1 hours. I had played my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. For an hour, then l watched tv l got before so l started to pace my parents had to stop me from leaving @NUM2 times l almost left the floor the sixth time. Then l came time for me to go down to the angeo room. It was a fight cause l wanted to walk and they said no. but they won. Then after the angeo l had to lay flat for @NUM2 hours. Then I got to go home
3	19	22	Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menu’s and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasn’t frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.
5	13	8	Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. For me, I'm ok at patience. Like I'm patiencet for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1. When I'm not patiencet is when I want I get on the computer. I Was also patiencet for getting my second class rank, well thats all I have to say about patience.
5	23	18	One day it was a cool new game that came out. It was a kid that had volume @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @DATE1, but they said this is the hot volume. The kid asked his mom for @PERCENT1 @CAPS2 said “what for?” @CAPS1 said “so I can buy this cool new game.” @CAPS2 said “@CAPS3 your father and I have to pay bills and buy food. @CAPS1 said “@CAPS4 I understand,” in a dissaponting voice. @CAPS8, when the boys hard working father walked through the door. The boy said “@CAPS5, could I please get @NUM4 ???, so I can buy this game. The father said “@CAPS6, I know how much you want this game, but I’m sorry I need to help your mother pay bills. The @CAPS6 said “@CAPS4 I understand.” @CAPS8 the boy’s grandmother called and said I need someone to cut my law for @NUM5”. The boy grinned and said “ I’ll be right over there.” @CAPS1 mowed the lawn with excitement. When @CAPS1 got the @NUM5??? @CAPS1 went right to the game store and when @CAPS1 arrived the line was @DATE1 blocks long. His grandmother said “well you gatto have patience. “@CAPS10 as the boy was next in the line. To be continued”
2	17	19	When I first saw my puppy @CAPS3 were at @ORGANIZATION2. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 brought over some dog to be rescued @CAPS3 saw all six dogs second one I saw I knew he was going to be mine. So @CAPS3 got him out the lady said that he’s scared and he gets carsick but I didn’t care he was my favorite. @CAPS3 said @CAPS3 wanted him so she told us to go to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and tell them @CAPS3 wanted @CAPS4 so @CAPS3 raced to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and on the way there @CAPS3 thought of names. My dad came up with the name @CAPS6 @CAPS3 liked it so that was his name I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home but as long as I got my puppy I was fine @CAPS3 got him a toy when @CAPS3 went back to see him I had it with every night knowing I was closer and closer to getting him the day finally came. @CAPS3 told my brother @CAPS3 were going fishing since he didn’t know @CAPS3 were getting a dog. But once @CAPS3 there I ran inside to go see him @CAPS3 took him home he was afraid of everything even leaves outside. But @CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell @CAPS6 its bed time and I sleep with my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough patient is the key.
2	15	13	“@CAPS1 story of patient” One time I was patient was when I went to the @CAPS2 for a check-up. Me and @CAPS1 dad have wait in the lobby for ?? time, after every ?? went in for the appointments. I couldn’t take it no more, but he made me stay. So I kept quiet. Well, most of the time really I wanted to say something really bad but instead I held it in. So finally we went in I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth. That’s @CAPS1 story about patience.
2	18	16	One day me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to alabama. It was the most boring thing @CAPS3! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make the matters worse I had the smallest bladder there wich as I can imagine @CAPS4! But we did get to count waffle haoes because the farther south you go the more people like waffles. I’m not kidding there was at least one waffle ???. And a kind of ??? was we weren’t just going to alabama  we were going to the @CAPS5 of alabama. So when we finally ??? ??? still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finaly got there we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from experience ??? rides don’t bother us??? ???.
2	18	16	It was late @DATE1  when my @CAPS1 is and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. So we take forever  to drive  there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patients on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there  were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd  came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the  hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patients left so we were in line to leave the park  for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finaly it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was  closed because of a car accident so we had to talk this huge detoer  that added a @CAPS5 to our time  because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 the time we got to our hotel I didn’t have one drop of  patients left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didn’t I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients.
4	20	16	A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having a blast. My family didn’t come because they don’t like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the @CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1 it and we even went on it twice.
1	8	9	I was patient geing my @NUM1. I took for ever to get it I had to be so patient getting the system. I took me ten mounts to get on my birthday he and to all the gamestop’s in taxlor to get it. I was in the car for hours to get we went in to one at the frist game stop we looked at and they had one insed it was in good condashi I got three games for it and that was the time  I was patient.
1	16	17	Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself.
1	15	16	It was the night before @CAPS1 eve and I couldn’t hardly wait. In @CAPS5 family on @CAPS1 eve we go to @CAPS5 grandparents house. When we are there we talk, eat, and @CAPS5 favorite open presents. As @CAPS5 mom, dad, and I drove up to @CAPS5 grandparents house I couldn’t open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. “@CAPS3 hello there, @CAPS4” @CAPS5 grandpa said. “@CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open @CAPS5 presents?” “yah, sure.” @CAPS7 we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn’t wait. As I waited patiently until all of @CAPS5 old relatives opened their presents it was finally @CAPS5 turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was @CAPS5 turn.
2	15	13	It was the @DATE1 when I went to see the creed consur with my cousents. There must have been @NUM1 or @NUM2 people in front of us. Then I herd and saw people shauing and pushing to get in. About @NUM3 to @NUM1 minuts later my legs started acking but I held on. I keep telling my self, “the pain is worth the waite!” finaly we got to the security gardes they had to do a metle detecoter on us. When we walked into the consurt I said, “that was a wifer worth wating for.”
2	9	11	One time I were a patient was when I broke my arm. I was there for @NUM1. I was playing outside and was climbing a pole and I droped down and I put a @CAPS1 on it and it swore up. My doctor was very peaceful. And nice. In conclusion this is a time I was a patient
3	18	15	Last @CAPS3 my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was patient for an entire @CAPS3. One @CAPS3, few months and four months and five months to be exsact. Why? Well, the game came out this @CAPS3, on @DATE1 and I had to wait for. How did I pass the time? Simple, don’t think about the game, try not to talk about the game and only write when it comes out on daily calenders. Even though I beat the game exactly thirty two times on every difficulty without any help. (heh,heh!) I still have to wait for another month or so for callop duty:@CAPS4. So this, ah, stinks because now I can’t stop thinking about it.
0	14	14	One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient.
2	8	6	My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don’t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don’t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don’t get the secrety on you.
1	14	15	Patience is??? our or waiting???Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience you and your younger sitting or young??? teacher would  constantly be  fighting. That’s why patience is as important. Patience should be constantly exconsiled. In sports it helps??? you need to basic the rer whether its a good or bad call. Patience also???because you’re not going  to be ??? of it the first ???.Patience makes perfect. School is a great place to use patience, whether learning something new of dealing will an??? teacher. You need to use it while dealing with???children because they are always trying to ??reactions?? of you whether they’re ??? bad. In the end it’s a ?? to call you ??. its very important to have that ??? whether its small things ??? Learning or big things like testing. Its rather to have patience than not.
1	17	16	A person I know thats paitent is my dad he is very paitent like one time we were in the drive through at mc donalds and soon as we pulled up the lady was like just one second and she but ??? sitting there for @NUM1 minutes and I saw like getting out the ??? and go in the resturant and order my food but my dad he just sat there adjusting gas until the lady came back and I was so mad that the lady made us sit there for @NUM2 minutes, but then I was happy cause I got my food. Then when we were putting off my dad said see that’s why paitients got ??? and my double chess barger and my large ice tea with chocolate chip cookies and my dad taught me a ??? lesson??? ??? ??? ??? nothing but drama and not happiness.
0	16	16	A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. @PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I make them @CAPS3 calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 sceawed out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called The unpatient.  Then @PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he's said I no @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 being called that way @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient.
0	22	22	It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4’s hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. “@CAPS1! Lots of answers.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 teacher, “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 whats your answer?” @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.” “@CAPS7 language?” @CAPS8 good answer though”. There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “@CAPS10”. @PERSON3 said. “@CAPS11 a metaphor?” @CAPS10 answered. “@CAPS13 you’re right it was a metaphor.” “@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!” @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently.
0	12	12	A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.  You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient.
3	19	16	Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs.
1	13	14	A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called x-men @CAPS3 wolver in and my mom said I had to what until @CAPS1 came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a lttle shorf on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few week had past I forgot all about the game then on @CAPS1 day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were oozning gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer that I go up to my room grab my @CAPS5 and headphones pop in x-me @CAPS3 and played it all day long
1	7	8	I know someone that was patient. The person was at the doctors she was savifly six and she still waited. They can fix that problem by asking nicely can I go ahead of you plezz. That will solve every thing in a kind and respetful way. That is what I think respectful way.
4	16	12	One time that I was patient was whe I was @NUM1 years old when I coght my @NUM2 fish. Me and my dad went fishing on my uncles bout my dad stoped the bout where we wher going to fish my dad help me put on my life jacet and then he bated my pocil. And then castede it out for me my dad was catching them like crazy in like the @NUM2 @NUM4 he got about @NUM5 fish he tould  me to be “patient” that it was my @NUM2 time so as my dad was reailing them in I was siting there waiting and then all of a sudden my bobes went down I yelled out to my dad he said realit in  I tride and tride and almost feel of the bout my dad came over and helped me when we got it on the bout I asked my dad what kind of fish it was he said it was a blue gill he said it was a good catch for a firsttimmer so me and my dad relised it and went back to fishing. That was a time where I had to be patient.
0	8	8	One time his years is seem a lay that was at the front of the lunch line and he was just about to go in but he had to go to the in because he wasn't all the way in the line. As he got sent to the in he had got mad but he went to the in but he was patient she didn't advice and next thing the new he was at the front of the line. I think that being patience mean when you are calm and you don't rush things and next thing you no you would be the next one
1	12	11	I asked my mom can I have something to eat. She @CAPS12’t say @CAPS1 so I wait wait then wait wait and wait and then I went up stairs and I waited @CAPS2. I was hungry then I was Being patient that whole time @CAPS3. I usually get the @CAPS4 use to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, I do. Another time @CAPS9 thankgiving I was patient @CAPS3 they were cooking the @CAPS4 and they @CAPS12’t cook the @CAPS4 yet so we waited until the @CAPS4 was @CAPS16 our stomaches were growling for @CAPS4 so I @CAPS13 A man of patience @CAPS3 I waited uNtil the @CAPS4 was @CAPS16.
3	19	16	At time I wsa very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used paintence, carefulness, and steady hand to finally succeed!
1	18	17	Patience is basicly waiting and tolerating it. Every year on @MONTH1 @NUM1 my family become seasonal at a camp ground. There @CAPS1 play and have fan and make many life long friends. Every weekend @CAPS1 go out there and @CAPS1 take are speed boat, ""the glass from. ""@CAPS1 pat it into the the lake and dock it at a dock. Then @CAPS1 go fishing on every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is were patience comes in @CAPS1 have to sit and watch oar bobbers float on the smooth glass like lake. @CAPS1 sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful thowe that I'm off school and I @CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over. So @CAPS1 sit there until the sudden noise of on of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that theres some yelling and ""@CAPS2 the net ""sayings. The funny. Part is that it is that it is ethier a large bass or a small nor there. And all this takes patience.
3	19	22	?? It was a normal old boring day in the @DATE1 but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to cedar point the next day. I was astonished! I didn’t know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. ??? When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep. I ended waking up at @NUM1 am and I was not to fond of that but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and ??? the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I’ve wanted to ride that one for ever. I was ??. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ½ hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that’s why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day hind of sucked it was still our all a great time!
3	8	5	Everyday at school I have to be patience to get my food like pizza,saled,sand with milk what is bad all the time but i check my milk. I had to be patientce to get my gun to.
5	10	15	One time I was patient was when me, my dad, @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @LOCATION1. Me, @ORGANIZATION1 and my dad wanted to ride the millenum force. So we waiting in line for two hours in the hot sun waiting to ride the ride. Some of the difficuties was the ride was having some problem. So when we finally got to the ride it tarn out ok.
1	16	15	One time when I was patient was my birthday I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that’s all I wanted. All of my friends had them I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn’t know where I was. It is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was  on a @DATE1 so the night before I was at the football game everybody was asking if I was going to get me and I kept on telling  them yes I’m getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift that I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and I started to get all of my friends numbers. I learned when your patient and not asking you will get what you want.
5	20	15	Sometimes on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, I have to control myself so I don’t just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! Like @DATE1 actually we are going camping up in @LOCATION2. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when  we do we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an “adventure hike,” so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesn’t!) And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isn’t ready yet. @CAPS4 I get to be in a bad mood… again! And have to wait some more!
1	13	12	Patient are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot. On our way out of the hospital I blacked out and hit my chin on the door so we had to stay their for about an hour. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient.
1	17	16	I was @CAPS1 excited to get my first ipad. But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient.
1	16	17	Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didn’t know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum I’m ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.
6	8	14	The time I waited for party to happen. It was @DATE2 until I’ve been invited to a party at zapzone. He told me the party was on @DATE1. @NUM1 weeks he told me that, and still didn’t have the party the he told that I had pay for myself accepted. But it was a party so I didn’t have @NUM2 weeks later I went school shopping for ten minutes. I came back he said he already had a party. He wasn’t there because a party takes an hour or two so I just let it go.
2	6	8	Where do I begin there wasn’t ever. A time when I was patient. I was alway rushing people do something and getting mad cause they wouldn’t do it fast enough or go fast enough for me. I would just get attitude. That why I cant be patient and now you know why. The end. The teaching on the way people coming i.e ???.
2	17	19	A time when I was patient was when I waiting in the hospital One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital we couldn’t go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncle were just sitting waiting very patiently. When the next day came we still couldn’t see her which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldn’t see her at all. The doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up smiling. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny scud the doctor said it wasn’t a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed.            In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didn’t and we stayed very calm. This is the time I was patient.
1	19	20	Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2… @NUM3… @NUM4… and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!
3	9	6	One time I was patient when I let a stranger cut infront of me to get some food. And when me and my brother both had to use the bath room I let him go first even though I was first in line.
0	16	16	I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore.
2	10	8	One time that I was patient was when I was saving up to buy a game. The name of the was halo reach. I had to wait @NUM1 weeks unit I could get it. But I was patient by waiting the whole time and not asking over and over agian.
3	24	21	Crack I twisted through the air and anded face up with my arm-rapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain @CAPS1 I wobbled to my feat, “what just happened?” I thought to my self I once again began to feel the nurendous pain shooting through my fore arm. I bit my lip @CAPS1 hard @CAPS1 I could to choke back all of the tears from just pouning out like a water fall. My friends launched toward asking me. if I was ok @CAPS1 soon @CAPS1 I started holding my arm. “I think I might have broken it” I replied in between jobs they rushed to get an aid @CAPS1 quickly a possible. I soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an ex ray at childrens hospital. There were both at work and were not able to come and get me @CAPS1 the day groaned on I became more and more anxious. Finally the bell rang it was @NUM1 at last.  “bang!” the door swung open it was my dad and not for behind him was my mom. @NUM1 is when they get out of work after my mom and dad told be how much there were glad it was nothing more than a broken arm , they immediately rushed me to @LOCATION1. That was my experience of a time I had to patient. And in the end it turned out I had a broken arm. In life there are going to be many situations where your going to have to be patient, lout all you can do is take life @CAPS1 it comes at you.
1	14	15	@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a huge past of life to be ?? While you have problems and obstacles that makes you a good person. To have @CAPS1 it ??? to ???  to get the job done that has a long process you might have to wait for an example I have to have @CAPS1 all the time. for like football, hockey and all the active things I do you have to have @CAPS1. As you know adults probably have any more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself.  like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day! Like he does it never does happen. Now when I become more grown up and an adult Iâ€™ll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say Iâ€™m getting better with @CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when Iâ€™m an grown adult Iâ€™ll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad.
5	19	14	One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got their we got checked in and there was alot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient but then he finally came then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient.
0	16	16	When I was patient, we were onone way to @CAPS1 point: with @LOCATION1 her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there. @LOCATION1 and I were very patient we wated and waited to get there we were soo exited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a hole bunch of rollercoaster. We all waited in line about @NUM2 hours for every ride it was extra buisy that day. @LOCATION1 and I wanted to ride the tallest rollercoaster. It was called the @CAPS2 the @CAPS2 was @NUM1 @NUM4 it was the tallest rollercoster. I had ever been on and all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a @NUM5 hour wait it was exosting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait!
1	18	17	Have you ever been patient or been told your patient? Patience has Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. When they got to the hotel Patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. The whole patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that to, Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is patience story of being patient. I hope you liked it.
3	17	14	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn’t know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents weren’t coming until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. My dad had a appogized and went to get me after I explained then I could finally go home.
6	13	7	Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient,he waited @NUM1  months for the xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game.But one day after school it arrived.
2	16	18	A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side I’m on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, “@LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time.” @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said “@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true.” even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didn’t move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends.
0	24	24	Being patient can sometimes be very hard, especially, when whatever you are being patient about is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and???  meself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside. We were having for throwing water   balloons mchother.I was already soaked from head to toe but we still kept playing .Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. I turned around and saw a huge be next to me.I was only @NUM1 yers old and very `afraid of bees. I turned  and  rah down the driveway and kept going around the house , thinking that the bee was still following  me .I was starting to get tired so I tripped and fell scraping  off a good amount of skin  in the process. I immediately began to org when I saw blood passing from the??? Inside to tell my mom. “@CAPS1! I fell!” I managed to scream between sobs. “@CAPS2 my gosh! Let me go find some band aids my mother replied. The pain was intolerable for my little body. I kept silently crying but I knew I had to be patient while my mom went to look for bandages. Just @DATE1 I had wasted bunk of band aids by plastering them a cross my don’ts face. I had to be patient and???For a long time, till my mother usually found the bandages. I found them!” my mom said, while running down the???In there / WAS setting.  “@CAPS3 you for being so patient?” @CAPS4 stock the   band aids a cross the cut on my leg and then gave me a lollipop. T know I had been a good girl by being patient.
3	12	15	My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called @CAPS1 children’s @CAPS2 . They come once every year. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout @NUM1 days. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other.
1	7	8	Patient is like your waiting for something and you don't complain its taking to long, and your just sitting there waiting quietly. Here is an example. One time I was waiting to go get a check up at the docters and your sitting there quiet reading a magazine and just sitting there. Theres an example on being patient
0	16	16	A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events. Soccer practice friends home and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know.
2	17	19	Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid of. It was @DATE1, exactly two mounts before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was to young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, this was partly true. She told me she would about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday supprise. I opened my pressants from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opend it, it was my phone. I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. Thats why you should always be patient, and wait. By; @PERSON1.

2	18	16	On a fine @DATE1 day I was heading toward the @CAPS1 office. I wasn't pleased. I didn't want the son to get there. But it did. When we got inside, my mom went to the checkin lane I just sat down. When my mom got done she sat right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited. We waited for about @NUM1 minutes until the @CAPS1 came and called us in. Right when we get into his office a nurse came in and checked my temperature, heat beat, ex. When she was done and left we waited and waited. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before the @CAPS1 came in. when he was done we checked out and left and @CAPS2 don't have to go there again.
5	22	17	A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1 the largest indoor water park I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM1’’our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, thats not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait it out. ‘’I have to go to the bathroom’’ I said in a moaning vice. ‘’well cant you hold it?’’ my mother asked I’m about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. ‘’ok pull over here, but it’s gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.’’  ‘’I @CAPS4’t core!’’ I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM3.’’ @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3  say ‘’arive on destinaton on left’’  ‘’@CAPS8!’’ I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that ‘’water park closed!’’ when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said ‘’sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow.’’ @CAPS9 out it was’nt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I could’nt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1 the park was still closed and we were checked out ‘’I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more night’’ my dad said. ‘’@CAPS8.’’ I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient.
1	16	15	Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient.
3	13	10	I was patient when I was going to the docteis to get???  ??? I didn’t complan about it. I had to wait for @NUM1 hours. Then when I went in thay toke a couple of ways it toke about @NUM2 hour. Then thay take some tests then at the end I finally went home. That was the time I was patient.
3	10	7	Sometimes I done show patience and sometimes I Do. Being patience is being @CAPS1, @CAPS2, And @CAPS3 the good charater traits that a leader has. Without patience you’ll @CAPS5 up at every thing hard you Do. So be leader, a person who @CAPS4’t @CAPS5 up.Be a person who you love in addition be every thinG you can be. Remember, patience is every thing.
0	12	12	Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.
5	14	9	One time I was patient when I was in @LOCATION1 getting on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 parents @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 was a @CAPS5 long line and I'm usually saying ""@CAPS6 on!"" Or sometimes ""@CAPS7's go!"" @CAPS8, I was being @CAPS5 patient in the line. I was proud of my self and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient.
4	14	10	My dad is a very patient person. He’s known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. I’m proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is.
1	16	17	One day when I was at my sisters football game. My mom droped us off at the game because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car she asked me if I had my money with me. I said no then she said your just going to be hungry. I said @CAPS1. @CAPS2 when the game started. I got really hungry. @CAPS2 I checked all of my packets, it just @CAPS2 happened that I found @NUM1 bucks. @CAPS2 I went to see how long the line was. The the was @CAPS2 long it was almost in the street. @CAPS2 I sat back down trying to let the line get shorter. But the line had gotten way longer @CAPS2 I ran in the line. I had to stand in the line for about @NUM2 mins. @CAPS2 when I finally got out of line I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. @CAPS2 she came up to us and asked me to bye her some @CAPS3 fries. I said no because the line was to long. @CAPS2 she said please! @CAPS2 I went back in line and it moved way slower. When I got back she said, what took you @CAPS2 long. I said look at the line. @CAPS2 that is one of the times I was patience.
5	10	15	One day a kid was going to school @CAPS4 was going to turn in a paper for math @CAPS2 @CAPS4 did. During @CAPS1 class @CAPS4 was doing a chapter sketch. His teacher called him over. The teacher said do you have, a page of a story that was due a month ago. @CAPS4 said “no” teacher asked “why” the kid said “because I have been going to a basketball tournament.” teacher said “you have tell tomorrow.” @CAPS2 the next day the kid is at @CAPS1 class @CAPS4 said “I’m @CAPS2 sorry I don’t have my paper.” teacher asked “why” “because my grampa died.” teacher said “okay tomorrow.” @CAPS2 the kid got his paper done.
3	6	3	Patience is something or someone who like waiting for someone or something patience part of life I sometime don’t have patience but I should have patience without patience you will get not because something in lift you have to want for and that is why you should have patience.
2	9	7	Patience is like waiting for something and not froaring out. Imagine if no one had patience everything would suck. Picture this your at the store there is a line at the register, no patience and people are fighting to get to it. Knowing that most people have patience that would not happen. Since the people have patience the world has order so if you think about it it's a good thing.
5	10	5	My dog  tedy bear is very impatient because when he comes in from outside he gets a treat, but he has to wait for the other dogs to come in
1	21	22	One time when I was patient was when we were flying to @LOCATION1. We were in @LOCATION2 waiting. God I thought how long can this take. But evenaly the plane came. Once on I thought ok this is the last plane we have to take today. But then the pilot said it was to be a @NUM1 @NUM2 flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my I-pod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decied I would read. But after an hour and – a – half I finished the book. Then my I-pod come out. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later. After eating lunch which took @NUM3 minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 which killed off enough @NUM4 hours. Then with only @NUM4 hours left I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of the office. Then when there was only @NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in @LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it.
5	11	6	When I was little I was pasent I would always sit and what for derection my mom always liked it that way @CAPS5 now sence @CAPS1 bigger she think's @CAPS1 inpasent  @CAPS5 your what @CAPS1 not I am pasent I get along  I am not ancey I m not the type when they say (when are we going yu gu) That is I when was @CAPS4 learning how to speak @CAPS5 I geuss that is how it gose and @TIME1 I was pagent because my mom and dad were having a talk and I was not about to here it it was gurorope talk.
2	22	24	The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane’s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3.
1	17	16	Being patient is a very important skill to have. You need this to live your life. With out patients your life would be very crazy. One time when I was patient and had to wait for it when it was time it felt good. One day about @NUM1 years ago. I went to @ORGANIZATION1. And if you have been there then you know how long the lines are. They can be up to about a hour and a half. I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted hause. It looked like it would be a lot of fun. Then when I got there it looked like there were @NUM2 people in line at the time. My mom asked, “@CAPS1 do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do the hannah I love?” I told her no and we got in the line. After about @NUM3 hour in line, there was only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and and I. Then it was finally our turn when I got to sit down in the chair and be buckled in, it felt good to know that after waiting for a long time I did it , I was patient. I did peeping asking if it was our turn, I just stood there patient. That was the time I realized that I had been patient. I knew from then en that I really could do it, patients. Its an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy
2	21	19	Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @CAPS1 away, that seemed to take so @CAPS2 to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just @DATE1 I took the @CAPS3.A.T to get into the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also know as @CAPS8, (@NUM1-@CAPS9) I had to wake up at @NUM2 am, on a @DATE2, to get ready. I had to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took @CAPS10 @CAPS11 to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the, we all got solo way afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day!
2	22	24	I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.
3	8	5	Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is being understanding and tolerant. For example a kids mom left for work she takes @NUM1 hours and she come home. The kid said “that was quick.” That is what patience.
2	12	10	A time I have to have patience some times is in class I have to have patience. I don’t have a lot of patiences. I have to have patiences in @NUM1 block @NUM1 block is moth. We as the students have @PERSON1. @PERSON2 talks all the time. He talks till luch wich is about for a half an hour. So I have to wait for a while till he gives us work. That how I have patiences. To conclude that when I have to have patience in class. Though I don’t have a lot of patience at all, but in class I do.
1	11	12	Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life it’s not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren’t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2.
1	14	13	Oh a time when me and my mom was patient is when we had to sit and wait for my mom to get her tags because it was her birthday that day. So it all started that morning we had woke ate breakfast and took our shower and put on our clothes did our hair. and brushed our teeth and bought time all that was about @NUM1 them after we did all of that we had lift then we had stayed in mouth ??? and bought time. all had got to @CAPS1 it our @NUM2 and we were both hungry so we stoped at ??? king and that was the day I had to be patient.
0	16	16	So one day in fifth grade I was running around playing tag on the play ground when  “push”  I got push off the slide a bout a ???fell and back my arm so it went ??? or they in pain so ??? went to the doctor’s and waited for two hours and I just sat patient by not moving my arm at all watching other people walk in and out finily they called my name they told me my arm was broken out the could not put cast on there to we went to the other doctor across the rode waited @NUM1 minutes and got a blue cast about a month later I got it taken off went back to the x ray room but then said I have to cast it up again this time I got ??? and eventily to got it taken off and thats the time I was patient.
2	6	8	Patience is useful in certain times like waiting for a blood test or to me your ??? again. In other times patience is usless as in the army, any army, you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy .Patience is mostly good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy.
0	12	12	One time I was patient. I don’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun.
2	18	16	One time me and my family were at @CAPS1 point over the @DATE1. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didn’t feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got their the wait time on the board said one hour and fortyfive minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but really wasn’t worth standing in that line. So when the line started moving and we were half way their the signs said @NUM1 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that we’ll be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was at @NUM1 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister.
1	10	9	I had to have patient's in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 we had to have patient in the @CAPS3. The @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 here slow we got ther a @TIME1 the we @CAPS5 it at @NUM1 we where in the @CAPS3.

My mom was very patient with me all she did was incorege me to move faster she tried to motiveit me and help me get redy for school she brought me my breakfast and put all my books into my back back. I thanked her all the end of the day for being so patient with me. That was the day someone was patient with me.
2	14	12	For me im not that patient canse if some one close something to me or any of my friends I will go off on them can see I don’t tolerat my frinds bing picked on by some one they don’t even know or I don’t know. Thers this one time me and my frinds were walking down the hall way at school. This kid semes out of know were and start to push my frind around and I asked the kid what his problem was and he said it was non of my bisness came see ur picking on one of my frinds so he stop pick my on him and tried to pick on me but he didn’t know that I had my brother and other frind around the coner of the bilding so I had my one frind that was right next to me go and get them so he did and the kid that was pickin gun me ran away.
2	16	14	My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn’t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re do it over five time I know it wouldn’t be able to be that patient without loseing  it.
2	12	10	One time I was getting a cool @CAPS1 game it was sooo awsome. And my mom said we will get it on fri. It was @DATE1 and was soo part for her to get of work. And she got home and said we well go on stater day. I was a little mad. Bat how cares.But yea we got the game on the next startday I could’t believe  i was patient
5	17	12	I was patient when my dad said he would get me some @CAPS1. They were @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 the shoes caust @MONEY1. I asked a few times. He didn`t answer, so I knew what to do. I decided the dishes, clean my room. I waited the shoes so bad; I cleaned stuff that was already clean. After a month of the cleaning, I still didn`t get the shoes. That’s how something went wrong. SCHOOL!!!!!!! I haven`t ben acting right in school. I got my stuff together. Then I got the @CAPS4.
4	20	24	Being patient is important, as I’ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn’t get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1’s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend’s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldn’t fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.
4	12	8	One time me and my dad were at a store.There was a line about @NUM1 people my dad and I were starting to get impatient so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I was still not calming down then the very first person left and then was starting to calm down and just wait for the next person to go.
3	21	24	Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!
0	20	20	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3â€ I can hear the clock ticking ,probly to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Every body is on the edge of their chairs waiting, why does @CAPS4 seem so long? Its almost @NUM1 minute now.the aroma of peperoni  pizza is so strong that I can practicly taste @CAPS4. This is agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds can I wait that long @NUM3 Iâ€™m not sure. The tension ogf the whole class is so great,I think my brain will erupt. I cant take this, @CAPS4â€™s way to much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 seems to be an eternity, @CAPS4 couldnâ€™t have been just a few seconds could @CAPS4? @CAPS4 must have been at least years. @NUM5 why is time so short? Iâ€™m not a very patient, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do Iâ€™m not seeing @CAPS4 got. Iâ€™m about to just jump out of my seat as if Iâ€™m ejected from a @DATE1. Iâ€™m trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that Iâ€™d be this anxious for lunch that I would have had breakfast. Were down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4â€™s enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again,brouse this time, begging for food, @CAPS5, demanding is more like @CAPS4. â€œ@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,â€the clock nocking me, taunting me @NUM8 seconds I canâ€™t bare this much longer. I think am about to snap. I donâ€™t handle patience well. @CAPS4â€™s a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems the bomb and clock are counting down together. Both anticipating my snap. Iâ€™ll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10, â€œ@CAPS10!â€ finaly, the bell goes of signaling lunch time . I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone.
1	12	13	In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you don’t be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didn’t get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life.
3	12	15	Patients  to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.
4	9	13	Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not.
1	18	19	The I was patient. One day my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my first time going there. We went to this lady and wait for the doctor call us. We sat for @NUM1 minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name. We go inside the doctors room and I sit down he does all this things. Later he yells us that we have to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that she took the medicine and was going through it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she through the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. I didn`t want her to do the other. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn`t she did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn`t so bad.
2	6	4	Well you need patience when your fishing and whe your food is comeing or going to be served to you but also be patient with everybody else.
1	8	9	This is my way of patience: patience is power without patience where would you be in the time of waiting on your house to be built? Yaid probalay be going crazy because you don’t want   to be living in a trashy trailer, camper or even a house! What about if your in a doctor’s office for @NUM1 hours! Yes your going to be agitated! But, see if you have patience your going to be able to wait patience is power!
3	18	15	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn’@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.
1	17	16	A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 appointment was at @TIME1. I was at least @NUM2 minutes away from the place. When we got there it was basically @NUM3, so I missed @CAPS1 appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time @CAPS1 mother and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment wer finished. We waited at least an hour an a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly I listened to music the rest of the time until they called @CAPS1 name. In conclusion this is a time when I was patient.
2	21	19	We were going to @CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting the to ride the skyline. After we ate, me my cousins and my??? headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole??? of cedar point. “im so excited” said one of my sisters. “yaa me too!” said the the other. We were walking towards it. It took really long. When we saw the line we heaked! “this will take so long” said my sister. I was so surprised my @NUM1-year- ol cousin her??? ???. “wow it look really high” said my cousin. “@CAPS2’t, worry we have @CAPS3 with us. She’ll take care of us” said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us. Wanting to go on so badly. “why @CAPS2’t you go ahead” said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she had start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again!
1	15	14	One stormy day, me and my brother were playing soccer in our house. My brother kicked the ball in the air and did a scissors kick. The ball hit my mom’s lamp and broke the bulb. She asked me and I said that it was my brother. My mom said that I should fix the lamp. It was hard and the pieces kept falling off. It took mere patience to fix it. Finnaly, no managed to fix it. Patience is always good to be patient.
3	17	14	Just be patient lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. How soon is soon? Awile. I will be done fileing papers in about an hour then I will take you to the park an hour? that is such a long time. Just go watch tv. but I dont want to leave me alone or when I get done I wont take you to the park ok. So @CAPS1 whent and placed vidow games with his little sister @PERSON1 for awhile, and made some pizza, and then his friend from school come over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his and his mom. So he asked lucie if he could go to the park with ryan and she said yes just be back by five o’clock. and he and @PERSON1 had a great time. and ryans mom got them all ice cream. and he learned that being patient is very very important.
4	22	18	A  time that i was patient was when i had to train my dog. “sit boy,” I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While @CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. “@CAPS2 here I’m done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please,’’ I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. “@CAPS1 done !” I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today @CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. “@CAPS6!” I yell waiting  for my dog to @CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesn’t listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off.
0	12	12	A time when I was patient was when I went to sedar point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and it was a long ride. When we got there it was a long line to get in. My mom said “all right guies time to be patient”. Once we got in we went to the first rid we seen. It also had a long line. Mom said “we are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides”.
6	16	10	One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1. We ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on. But the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient. After the ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a line, I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. The @CAPS2!
8	16	8	I’m going to write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone she said if I be patience I will be able to get a phone so I was patience. Time flew bye and family she sad yes see when I was patience to get a cell phone I got one. Have you ever been patience with your family? Tell me did it work out of did it go bad with your family if you are it probably will work for you.  And that is what happens when you are patience.
1	17	16	Two week sago meandmy family went to siyflags, for fright fest. The lines were going to be long and I would nevero be patient, I hate being patient . We went on @LOCATION1 city @CAPS1 first the lines was only ten minutes. Then the super man, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the riper. Then perisa wooden rollercoaster that goes of the track a lot we waited @NUM1 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we sun the coster people with these flash passes kept coming. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we fin ally got to the front of the line my patients was @CAPS2. The roller coster went off the track. It was a @NUM2 mile coster but a tur one. That is the time I was  patient.
5	13	8	A time when I was patience was on the car ride @LOCATION1. It was a @DATE1 hour car ride but I stayed patience I diden’t complain. Most kids would say are we there yet but I diden’t. Also when I was supper hungry I sat there and did not complain. Finally @DATE1 we got there. That is a time I was patience.
7	18	11	Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have.
5	21	16	Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better.
3	12	15	Today I am talking about patents. Patents mean’s to take something easy or to handle something with comaness. Like for example I went to an @CAPS1 machean and I wanted to get money, @CAPS2 I put the card and the pen, then I wanted @NUM1 dolors @CAPS2 @CAPS3 gave me only the receipt @CAPS4 cash @CAPS4 cards @CAPS2 I dident brack @CAPS3 I just called the company and I got the mony and the card. New this is the main story I vent to the mall to get a shoe @CAPS3 vas one hundred and ten @CAPS3 was on sale one hundred dollors, @CAPS2 I wanted to buyit the casher man sad “one hundred and ten dollars please” @CAPS2 I told “him @CAPS3 was on sale, he sad “get out of my store @CAPS2 I told him I came to buy a shoe. @CAPS2 I returnd @CAPS3 and vent out. Theats atime when I was patient.
4	14	10	I am writing about a time when I was patient. Me myself @CAPS1 not a patient person. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting on the bus to come but I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. So my mother said “@CAPS2 stop complanning and be patient @CAPS1 serious!” so as soon as I sat down the bus came!
3	23	20	For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunter’s orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in it’s place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience @MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.
3	22	19	This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plain in an airport. We were on ar way to @LOCATION1 and we had to take two plains to get there. When we got off the plain to the second airport we went to go see what time our second flights comes in. when we found out the time for the second flight we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. my mom told me I had to be patient but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind we decided to eat. When I was done eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me. So I started to play my ds. Before I knew it we only had one hour left so playing my ds distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so that’s when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden our plain arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learnt to be patient.
4	14	18	A time when I was patient was when I wanted a Do I. for my birthday. But I couldn’t get it because my moma had to pay the rent. So I waited and then finally it was my birthday. I didn’t have it but then @NUM1 months went by and it was @CAPS1 and I got it and I was so happy. @CAPS2 time when I was patient was when I had to babysit my cousin for @NUM2. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not. So I waited and ?? to gave me my money. But not only did he give me @NUM2 he gave me a late fee @NUM4 and I was hapy. And that added up to my money, that my mama gave me and it was @NUM5 and I went skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at @DATE1 ??? and on @DATE1 added held ???. they were then @CAPS2 time when I was patient was when it was @NUM6 days before my birthday and I was leaving a sleepover I ??? went to go buy everything and it was like the next day was my @NUM7 birthday. I did everything I had so much fun it was like heaven at my house.
3	14	17	ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn’t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she’s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten.
3	19	16	Real @CAPS3 was one of fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him beat him in a race, or even sneak up on him. This made him very, impatient. Even when his friends and family spoke to him, this is what they pleaded like to him. ""@CAPS1…@CAPS2… @CAPS3…@CAPS4…are …You…doing?"" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was. So he ran away. He ran away. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @NUM1 minutes and he was already in @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2, he said that people didn't walk and was fast as he could. But that didn't when him team talk to them. For sure where can I find nement  @CAPS6?"" The @CAPS7 responded. ""@CAPS8…ch….first…eh….you….turn….eh….best…ch""   @CAPS9 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 screamed he had to believe that no one was as fast as he was. So he just had to be patient
1	20	19	Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldn’t sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, “hi!” very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient.
3	14	11	The time I was patient is when I was to clean up my house and my mom said I would like me to ??? when she get’s back. So I straighting up vaccuming spreading my bed cleaning bathroom taking the dogs outside clean thier raven did the dishes took out the trash did the laundry and once I done with a lot I would watch @CAPS1 play the game or on the computer I waited about the whole day and once she got her she didn’t when bring would she said I forgot so we were to get pizza.
0	8	8	One time I was pacient was when my mum said that she would buy me a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I waited and waited and waited and wated for her but I knew I had to be pacient because she was going through hard times.
7	17	10	Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience
3	16	13	One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There where about @NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people got in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient.
1	11	12	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.
1	16	15	When I was patient I was sitting at a restront. And I ordered my drink and mike was the first one. Then when we got our food they said it will take about five more minutes so I sat there it was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patient’s. so then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal thes time it was. The right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patient`s I had. And thats when I was very patient.
3	17	14	A time when I was patient was at the doctors. The doctor took to long and I was patient and I was patient for the doctor to come back to the room. I was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and my mom and I go to the doctors because I had an apontment. I got their and the doctor call me and took me to a room and like @NUM1 mins later he came back. All of that time we were waiting me and my mom were talking things. I like what is takeing so long and my mom said I don’t know but just wait. Then the doctor comes and starts asking me quatons like what I eat, and what I do for exersi and say. I don’t know. Then after they stepsesling the quatons they say sorry for keeping you patient and give my mom some papers then we go down stairs and I had to go to a lab to take my blood. Their was a lot of people and I was patient then they call me down and take my blood that was a time when I was patient with my mom at the doctors.
2	21	19	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didn’t happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldn’t stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didn’t panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didn’t take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldn’t stop in time. When I hit my head it didn’t hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didn’t hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over.
2	9	11	Being patience is a good thing because if you are and then you are in some rough time in life. Patience people can do by bringing something to do. They could what there for three hours and not be herd. There are some people that can’t what there for three hours. There are some people that can’t what there for ten minets. These people get made at that and they will just give up. But after all of those people that can and can’t people cant quit. People what there for one hour and will blow up. And then there are people that can’t do it but they do. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can’t do it.
3	18	15	A time I was patience was one time we were @CAPS4 the store and I was @CAPS2 excited to go to the toys section. “@CAPS1 we were goin to have go to the grocerys first,” said mom. I was really mad and mom said “be patice the quicker we do this the faster well get to the toys.”  @CAPS2 we are @CAPS3 done with the grocery and then we have to go to the clothes section. I was really really mad. Mom said “the quicker we do this the fast we get to the toys.” @CAPS3, I had to try on clothes. I hate try I on clothes,” I said. Then I was @CAPS2 excited because we go to go to the toys selection I was @CAPS2 happy. I looked, an look an then mom said “I could pick out a toy.” @CAPS4 was @CAPS2 hard to choose I didn’t what to pick till I saw a cool truck. @CAPS4 had big tries @CAPS4 had flames and @CAPS4 was green. I asked and please please? An mom siad “@CAPS5 u can get I was @CAPS2 happy. And that was a time I was paticene.
4	12	8	Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something . Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patient at all. Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut. That’s what patient is to me.
2	7	9	I am patient every year @CAPS1 one specil day to come. My birthday ??? ??? @NUM1 was a specil day @CAPS1 my mom and dad, @NUM2 boy my mom ever had @NUM3 boy my dad had. I am still wating @CAPS1 my brithday to come again.
1	18	17	To say really I’m not a very patient person, but once I was, I don’t really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting @NUM1 minutes passed then @NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldn’t wait any longer. I “@CAPS1” and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!!
1	18	19	One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the ‘A’ team and the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Finally there was about @NUM1 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was @CAPS2!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Although it wasn’t the ‘A’ team I was still happy I didn’t get out. That was a day I had to be very patient.
0	12	12	Patience, what do you think when you hear that word? When I was little I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that, but after I badly hurt my ankle and was pat in a cast and on crutches for four months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say “patience is vertue,” have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience? Well its really just the ability to control your self, you have to be able to get through tough situations and still be controlling yourself, and you really have to control yourself when people annoy you of things take awhile
4	16	12	A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. My kept saying “@CAPS1 you will be able to go out”. My cousin was very mad, she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch telling her what my mom said. After an hour past I was able to go outside, but my cousin could not. She wasn’t being patient. That is a time when I was patient.
4	21	17	This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say usher tickets on sell that and then I frozzes to listen, the tickets were going on sell down town. I told my mom and she rushed in the car and got dozen there so fast you wouldn’t even see us leave. When I got to the line it was so long it seem like it go on forever. I waited and waited it felt like it only moved on an inch. Ti waited and still waited I beagin to get mad but I stood in line. Which my long wait was over I begain to jump for joy. As I walked to the concer she said “sorry we are all sold out. I couldn’t believe it I begain to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing it was so unfair. And that’s the time I was patient for noting.
1	6	7	I saw someone @CAPS1 patient the got to a rest runt before I did and den I orderd my food and it came. They done sill had no food so I left and finally they got the food now that’s what I call patiants.
4	20	16	It takes patience when you are out hunting. After about @NUM1 deer seasons my patience paryed off. I was using a bow and ran @NUM2 point walked out. He was about @NUM3 yards from my stand and I called him closer. Then he was @NUM4 yards from my stand. I took the shot and he buckled and the @NUM5 minutes I waited to find him felt like in life time. Then I got out of my stand he ran about @NUM6 yards and droped. When I got to him. I was so excited because he wasn't won @NUM2 point he was a @NUM8 point back. Do remember use the regin blood head and be patient you could shoot the deer of a lifetime.
3	16	19	“@CAPS1” The bell had finally rang and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end. I rushed to lunch without even stopping at my locker. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line. I stood there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I justed waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didn’t complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain.
4	12	8	Hi, I'm @PERSON1 And this is A time of when I was patient. My mom and my step dad were going to take me And my step sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. BUT!! There was A twist we couldn't ask ""Are we there yet"". So we had to wait A really long time. But when got there we got there it so worth the wait.
5	22	17	A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didn’t understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didn’t go with science, and he didn’t listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldn’t beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient.
1	14	13	Today I’@CAPS3 going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On test(like @CAPS3.E.A.P) she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is @CAPS2). At the @ORGANIZATION1 she doesn’t await in a long line for a corn dog.Now I’@CAPS3 starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn’t mind to wait for me when I have to do something.
0	20	20	This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the @TIME1, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, @CAPS1!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of @DATE1, and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to @LOCATION1. I was ??? to  get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally” That was the story of how I Was patient.
3	16	13	Having a melt @CAPS1! I have expereanced this @CAPS2 scene when I was in the @NUM1 grade at cross creeds christm school. It was the @DATE1 and we lived just around the corner. @CAPS3 @NUM2 minutes my patients where a little almost at the fact that my mother wasn’t there get and @CAPS3 @NUM3 minutes later I had a temper  tantrism and cryed and my patients was like a ballot that poped and lowered slowly as I grew angrier and. Angryer at the fast my mom wasn’t there yet. This mast ake will @CAPS4 happen again to me. I made the rong chose to get mad over something redic  usasly  dumb. Learn from my words I as @CAPS4 give up keep trying.
5	17	22	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him.
3	21	18	When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family and my cousins were gooing  to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so exited and very impatient I couldn’t wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten say they are gonning to be here in @NUM1 but they were never their. Soon i realized it was about @NUM2 p.m and knew i wouldn’t see them untill tomorrow and i will be patient so i don’t waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good nights rest i got up are breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. @PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk!Honk! could it really be no it couldn’t it was uncle @CAPS3 and his big motorcycle. A few hours later i heard @PERSON1 again and said uncle @CAPS3 is probably leaving but then i herd my cousins @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5 flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked  the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key.
8	16	24	I didn’t know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called buddies. I’ve never been there until that day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet pepsie. My sister got a fruit punch. As always. My mom and dad got a mountain dew. My brother got cherry pepsie. I don’t know why we all got different drinks. It took @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasn’t so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was @NUM2 minutes. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The resturaunt wasn’t even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient.
2	16	14	One time my sister and my mom were pacint was when l went to dicks sporting goods and l wanted a new bag and adidas sandles and crazy scocks well it took me hours to pickout socks there were zebra, strips, blank, blaid, and dots so my sister did not get to get anything cause she did not have money. So finaly I just pick the zebra ones then l had to find the adidas but then l could not find them so like an hour later the only had one left witen were my size but this girl took them right off my feet and took them so l looked at my mom and she was nappy as can be so then l went to get a bag they had one pink left so l grabbed it and went home.
2	16	18	It was a light breezey morning. It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient.
4	12	16	Some people a completely patient. Some people aren’t patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we’re going somewhere special, or I’m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It’s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can’t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I’m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I’m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn’t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don’t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers aren’t always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!
5	11	6	Patience can really help you in life some times it’s the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I’m waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient.

3	16	13	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatience just waiting their. But sudden ly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just reilized it was a hour we been waiting. Under standing in patience means you know why you have to stand their waiting. Because you can’t push or shuvie your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can’t do or get what ever you wan’t unless you truble. You can’t hit, cut, push, or shuve to the front of the line, you just have to wait.
0	10	10	PATIENT. One time I had to be very patient over at @CAPS1 barrymores because we went into a line to go on go-karts that yexi had to be at least @NUM1 years old or older to go. I also had to be patient my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff but I never imagined it would this cool.
5	16	11	One of my storys of being patient is this one time was at my uncles nonse and I wanted to play the tboy @NUM1. Well the was like five other kids to and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited like for a hour or two atleast it felt like it and I didn’t say a word about it the whole time, then I finally got to play. That’s my story about being patient.
4	17	13	A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. It we didn’t understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I’ve ever ???
0	16	16	When I have patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can speat in, my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family. And we all was dress alike for my birthday. So I ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he want to tell what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finly said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finly bring my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. Then I said o I don`t care cause I didnt eat the fries. They said why I because I the fries is neasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have patience.
4	11	7	One day my dad and I decided we would go fishing. He kept saying five more minutes, so I just sat there in the car. Finally I got out to find him a sleep with a note saying @NUM1 more min.
3	20	17	There I was on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner.
3	24	21	There once was a little girl named @PERSON2 @CAPS10 was the important girl in the land of narrative. Narrative was a little land felled with loveing and patient people who waited for everything. And every child was patient but @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was a only child living with her mother and @CAPS12. @PERSON2 hated being the only child so: @PERSON2`s mother named @CAPS3 told her husband @CAPS1 that they should have another chilled so that @PERSON2 would not be only. Soon they told @PERSON2 that @CAPS10 would be having a little brother or sister @PERSON2 was very happy. Infact @PERSON2 was so happy that @CAPS10 ran up stairs and began to make up baby names. Then ran down stairs and shared them with her mother rocking in her chain. I like kuven said @CAPS12 walking toward the dinner table were @PERSON2 and her mother where siting. Ok said @PERSON2 cleaning the table of “Do you like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or @CAPS6”said. @PERSON2. I like @PERSON1 said @CAPS12 pushing in his chair. Me as well said mother walking up stairs toward her bed room. “I can`t wait till the baby gets here “said @PERSON2 on her way up the stairs. The next morning @PERSON2 a woken early to see if her mother had the baby.” @CAPS7 you have the baby yet” said @PERSON2 weaking up her mother and @CAPS12 “@CAPS8” said the @CAPS12,” the baby haves to grow inside of mommy okay. Okay said @PERSON2 . @NUM1 months later. Kerry got up very early screaming “is here @CAPS7 it come “@CAPS8,” said the mother lefting her head over her belly to see @PERSON2.” that baby will never come, I hate that thing I will be lonely for ever” said @PERSON2 walking toward her bed room. Be patient @CAPS10 will com screamed @CAPS12 from the other room. “@CAPS10” said @PERSON2 it’s a girl “@PERSON2 got very much happy @NUM1 hour later “oh, oh, oh” screamed mother form her bed room. “Are you okay mommy “said @PERSON2 walking into mothers bedroom. “The baby is coming call your @CAPS12 “said mother. “@PERSON2” yes “mother going to have to deliver this baby okay. @NUM3 hours later dad come home running up the stair and went in his room and saw @PERSON2 his wifey @CAPS11 & the new baby @PERSON1 fast asleep. Told you if you where patience @CAPS10 would come “said” @CAPS12 talking to his self
0	16	16	It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at school so boring as usal and my @CAPS1 came in on cruches I freaked out and, ran over to her and she told me she broke her leg and that she wasn’t allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was hard waiting a whole month to hangout with her but, her safety was more important than my amusement. It was @NUM1 weeks after my friend breaking her leg out, I was doin well of not bothering he so I was proud of myself, but I got to help her around school. It was a few more weeks later she was almost better so I was excited and went and bought her a gift. The next @DATE1 @PERSON1 was out of the crauches and, cast and back on her foot that’s the story of the time I was patient.
3	14	11	A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shoping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shoping it was boring but it was kind of full because some of clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq. When you have patient's it can pay off in the end and always have patiens where ever you go or are always have patients.
2	12	10	Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good desisons fo me, patience is the ability to stay calm, patience is very important because it alows me to ratinoly deel with suituations so that I @MONTH1 not get into trouble: @CAPS1 patience in times of stress is dificult. It is dificult beacause people are giving you greit. without @CAPS1 patience people make bad dessisons, this leads to bad things hapening. Paitence lets me deal with bad ideas like the @CAPS2’@CAPS3. by using paitence, I can deal with the problem and then move on @CAPS2’@CAPS3 are a very bad idea
2	21	19	@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day @PERSON1 was out of his cage playing with his ownersâ€™ sister hamster @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just got a brand new hamster toy. @CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb in and a slide and running wheel. @PERSON1 wished he had one, @CAPS1 his owner didnâ€™t have enough money yet. Even when @PERSON1 play in his, he still wanted one. @CAPS5 was very hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 saw @PERSON1 playing in his. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking ta @PERSON1, I really wish I had one of those hamster toysâ€ said @PERSON1.â€ @CAPS1 my owner doesnâ€™t have enough money!â€ â€œ@CAPS2â€™t worry â€œsaid @PERSON1.â€ You can play in mine until he does. I hear heâ€™s almost got enough.â€ â€œ@CAPS3, I guess, thatâ€™s close enough. â€œA few days later, @PERSON1 got the brand new toy, never than @CAPS4, â€œI guess @CAPS5 was worth waiting!â€ @CAPS5 was twice as big than @PERSON1â€™s, so they could shore. And they both lived happily ever after.

1	14	13	The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it.When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient.
1	20	19	Patients for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn’t have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and @NUM1 other people were sitting and watching for @NUM2 @DATE1!!!. I wasn’t vary patient then but @DATE1 on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paper work because she didn’t make me all appointment. So that took about @NUM3 min. then we waited, and waited, and waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1 if you add that up this @NUM2 @DATE1 waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasn’t. So finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for @NUM3 min. then finally they gave us the paper/ physical, and then we left. Practice ended at @NUM7 and we didn’t get home until @NUM8!!!. That is a time I was patient.

2	17	19	One day my mom, my sister, and I was going to the hair salon to get our hair done. It was so many people there talking. It was kind of noisy too. The tv was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people talking. When we got there my mother signed all three of us in on the sign in sheet then we had to sit and wait. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry and I was sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn’t let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 player and listened to it until it was time for us to come next. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry but I didn’t say anything. So we waited and waited and finally we were up next. And we all got our hair done. Then when we left we went to get some food because we were all hungry. And that was a time I was patient at hair salon.
2	14	12	Anna sat there waiting patiently, come on come on come on! She thought to herself, meets, and was very excited to perform her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go,only making her situation more difficult she took a deep breathe,and sat down patiently, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges

2	14	16	There was a boy that wanted to go to gym so when he got there he had to chance. But the was a sertant basketball he wanted. As he was getting dressed other boys got out there first and took the ball. Later when he got out he saw they had it. So when he got over he was mad and took it from them. After the insadent he came and gave it to them and sayed “I can wait”. So when the were done he got it he was so happy and proud, that he finally got the basketball. When he got home he told @CAPS1 mom and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked,”what is that?” @CAPS1 mom said “it is a thing when you understand and tolerant. The boy was very happy because he always used to take things and now he can wait to use something to be happy. That boy now lives happy with @CAPS1 mom in high school patiently moving along the end.
1	17	16	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person.
4	20	16	Patience the thing going mainly tell you time and me going at and you about a time when I was patient and how I did stuff to make myself patient. One day my dad and I try out wait in the hospital to get a trip replacement and we had to sit and wait in the waiting room @CAPS2 @NUM1 hour.  I was wondering why wait @CAPS2 all time and come hand. Well thing kept telling us wait @NUM1 more hour. Anyway I hurt I quit next my mouth in the chest two hours that then I touched my chest was a look all that a sure when he’d to ride a @CAPS1. Then after that when we had counted the circling tiles @CAPS2 @NUM3 minutes and noted that I remember them over @NUM4 tiles. That the can climb I didn’t complain that yet at least.  After I counted the circling tiles I played @CAPS2 all with my dad I won and we ate up @NUM5 minutes @CAPS2 the rest of the time I played my @CAPS3. I played @ORGANIZATION1 and the game. I was me a while then I did it. @NUM6 more it was time to go home my dad and I was tired beyond help. I didn’t complain once and that is the time I was patient.
3	14	11	I am always patient. But  do you know when and were I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut. Every time I go to get my hair cut it is a lot of people in the @CAPS1 shop. So day people say they have to go some were for a party or for church and need there hair cut pronto. So I let them cut and I have to wait and be patient. It makes me kind of happy to be patient because I am helping others and if I need someone to be very patient with me then I will want them to be patient.
2	11	9	When I had to be patient, was when I wanted a psp. So there was a time when I wanted a psp so bad so I ask my parents, they said I had to wait till @CAPS1. But I really wanted it but I decided to wait for a long time and I finally got a psp.
3	16	13	Hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremly still and quiets did you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a musle all the turkeys will run away. Some times you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was  hunting with my dad @CAPS1 sitting under a tree fro probablee three hours and finally a turkey came, unfortunutly just about when I had a shot my dad scared them all away but I still had the patience to stay out there for another @NUM1 hours. That is my example of patience.
0	24	24	I’m currently writing my comic book, I havent begun drawin it yet. Here is a major scene in the @NUM1 book. “@CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet?” @CAPS2 asked with curiosity “@CAPS3. not yet” @PERSON1 replied with a sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really lost. “Are we there yet?” little @CAPS2 asked again. “@CAPS3, @CAPS2, you’ll just have to be patient. “@ORGANIZATION1  said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So the walked for hours, but still @CAPS3 sign of the castle. Little @CAPS2 was egar to meet the queen, for she had imagined the queen as a kind, patient, beautiful woman. @ORGANIZATION1 could @CAPS9 that @CAPS2 was tired, lifting her on her shoulders she said t @CAPS2, “@CAPS9 if you can @CAPS9 the castle from here @CAPS2.” @CAPS11 a few long patient minutes, @CAPS2 finnly saw the castle “I @CAPS9 it, I @CAPS9 it!” she said with a smile. Jumping off of @ORGANIZATION1’s sholder, she bolted down the narrow path way. Because she had waited she was as excited as ever. Not only because she had found the castle but because she learned how to be patient.
1	18	17	You being patient is important. People should always be patient &not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time & wait. People need to understand that it you are not patient then particular things want happen to you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, shayna was not being patient because she wanted on get on the dance box. But, she could`nt because a lil girl named @ORGANIZATION2, was on the dance box & shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when you we get our attitudes. Shayna got mad & started to cry & roll her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS1 she now up to me & said, “she want let me get on,” @CAPS1 I said, “@PERSON1`@CAPS2 , you have to be patient & wait your turn because she was on it first & that would be rude and unfair to make her get off.” @CAPS1 @PERSON1`@CAPS2 apologized & they both took turns on the dance box. But last, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 was happy & she learned her lesson.
3	20	17	Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way A song can make you feel, I love how walking a line on the @ORGANIZATION1 can change your day. As a young musician I all I can ever think about is music, I had reache my @NUM1 instrument @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, the only instrument my family owns I can’t play is the bass. So when my @ORGANIZATION2 broke I took mr.groth up on his need for a @CAPS3 in @CAPS4 band. I studied my butt of learning the art of the bass @ORGANIZATION1, reading the clef and learning the notes, I was waiting for my ranking to increase and memorization and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better and it seemed each week I got better and better. I had easily fell in love with the sounds it made and I had found  I  loved it way more than the @ORGANIZATION2, shure it will take time to become a pro but I u learned its worth it .
1	17	16	Waiting into the @LOCATION1 double doors of the fravential I am @CAPS1 by a man in a suit, “welcome to the fravsthat” the man??? as soon as we enter we can walk on firther to the??? ??? infront of us. “when does the show start?” I ask excitedly. “@CAPS2 till about @NUM1. “ my mom replies. Eight thirty was about an hour away and we couldn’t sit down due to the crowd ahead of us. @NUM2 minutes passes by and @CAPS2 one person was admitted into the show. @CAPS2 even the elegant music could mask the crowds uproar. Another @NUM3 minutes passes and our seats finally await us. Walking down the walk way I ease into seat @NUM4 as the show begins.
3	11	8	The time  I was patience was when I snowbling with my family .Because my dad and I h ave to get them wormed and get them  off the trailar and start them  and he has to ride one around and get us a track and  I ride be hind him on the other sled and I muc to get the snow geon on and that is not ,we go to my aunt and house in @LOCATION1 ,I’ve been to a lot of places on the sleds .
2	21	19	Some people say that if somebody’s trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but thats not always true. One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It’s really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides he’s going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didn’t really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didn’t have to the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn’t always work.
8	16	24	At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient.
5	24	19	I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think it’s time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didn’t say it was the time to get a phone the next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better. I still didn’t get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said “@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something” I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said “wait @CAPS2” me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said “@CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out.

But we were patient and that she longed date ever the end .
1	13	12	A time when someone was patient was when a guy named @PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the side walk and it was a red light. She yelled out loud “go old man”  the old man went and she flowed him to the store and she asked what was that and @PERSON2 sales that was nothing .No you tried  to hit me no you were rushing  me so I went. @PERSON1 saies to @PERSON2 I was looseing or patience .@PERSON2 tell her well learn how to control the in.
0	24	24	I was patient for a whole @DATE1. Although, that was only because @CAPS2 mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the wii. For @CAPS5 had just come and had me interested the first time I saw @CAPS5. @CAPS5 was comoletely doctor and had advanced graphics.  I had informed  @CAPS2 mother about this system immediately.  ""@CAPS1, I will buy @CAPS5 for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" @CAPS2 mother had guarenteed me.  ""@CAPS3! Thanc you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting @CAPS2 hopes up and expecting @CAPS5 within  @CAPS6 weeks. Although I had done that only to later on dissapoint myself. @CAPS2 mother had informed us that I was to get @CAPS5 in between the time period of one to  the months. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" I had shouted. "" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life. After appioximontly one and a half months of waiting, @CAPS2 mother had finally and, ""@CAPS9 are going to @CAPS10 today to buy your wii"""". At that very moment. I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even  me. So when @CAPS9 pulled up to @CAPS2 favorite video game retail store, I was so excited  I couldn't sit still.  ""@CAPS13 down! Geez, @CAPS5's just a video game system!"" I @CAPS12 stopped immediatly. ""That's what you @CAPS14."" I mumbled to myself. When @CAPS9 had returned home, I had kept playing until @TIME1. So that is when I learned  @CAPS5 pays off when your patient.
0	9	9	Patience @CAPS1 is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying “hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody.
2	7	9	Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.
1	23	24	Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it’s a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn’t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad’s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, “will you use it?”
1	12	11	Being patient is waiting your turn in line and @CAPS3 cuting you should wait because cuting in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and  @CAPS1 disrespectful. and you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you don’t wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rouged to rush things when other people don’t want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you don’t wait. Be respectful and wait it’s a better way to make friends. And if someone is @CAPS3 being respectful to you tell them to be. And then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr.
1	13	12	Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.
3	19	16	Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.
0	18	18	This is a story about a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient is when I was at food store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took olday to give it to me . I waited so patient. Other people was ??? in ???  there ??? they still did not give me mine, so I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food . I told him that because he kept asking me why they are taking so long. So I went back in the food store and asked them why are you taking so long, they said it’s coming in a second. Then I set down in the food store and I looked and so my friends coming into the food store. So we started talking and waiting patient for are food. Their names are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @PERSON1. My name is @CAPS3, I was born in @DATE1 , I was raised in the city of @LOCATION1 oit. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I’m about to go home, after that I left. Thats a story about a time when I was patient.
0	19	19	One time I should patient was when I friend same thy that I wanted for long time. As soon as I got here I charged towards the computer to see did was still available. ""@CAPS1."" I sad try am plently, it was still there. It had taken me sad a long time to sort up for it.

I went school the next day and the next, and for a week @CAPS2 continued till I thought was how coal it would be to finly get @CAPS2.

My heart hoped and beat faster @CAPS3 I ran inside and ward it up and there, it was my @CAPS4 new I pad buck I was so, so happy and all of ""my patience had payed off I had got it.
4	23	19	A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a @DATE1 when I was at the park. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slide. My little brother came running over their and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1. when my brother returned he asked “where do I go?” And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone I was trying to be patient when  he got back he had my mom. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like along time to me. When he called my name my mom picked me up and she went toward the doctor. He asked “what brings you here?” we told him the news and he took into the room. The doctor moved my foot around. Ten minutes later he came back in with the x-rays and annoced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crushes and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient and I said thank you!
6	21	15	I remember the time I got my new puppy we had to be patient. We had to be patient because, he wasn’t fully paddy trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows .So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I don’t know  why it would try to move us but it did .We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took until he was @NUM1 and a half years out to figure out that he wasn’t supposed to do that  but on (my dog) is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dop to brave his hobbies, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient.
2	17	19	Waiting in the line to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I complained,"" @CAPS2! When are we going into the park?"". ""@CAPS3 patient,"" @CAPS9 mother hissed back. ""Being patient is boring!""I complained again ""yeah,"" shouted @CAPS9 sister. ""@CAPS4 so bored! Its not and @CAPS9 feel hurt and- ""@CAPS5!'', shouted @CAPS9 @CAPS2. ""Were almost there!"" @CAPS6 @CAPS8 seemed like hours, we @CAPS7 got to the ticket booth.""@CAPS7!"" I meaned.  We went inside the park."" @CAPS8 first?"" I asked @CAPS9 sister pointed to a ride. ""That one!"" @CAPS9 sister yelled night before she ran to a ride. We followed @CAPS9 sister to the ride."" @CAPS10, lets ride @CAPS12. It looks fun."" said @CAPS9 dad as we walked to the line."" @CAPS11! More waiting!"" I shouted"" @CAPS12 is gonna take forever!"" I complained.
1	18	17	On my last trip at @CAPS1 point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for @NUM1 hours on the mantis. I had to be patient, but it was hard to because… the mister fans were having tecinal diffucatties . And how can I be patient when it is @NUM2 degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was @NUM3 way I kept my patience."" I told my self, ""and in no time you will be there."" @CAPS2 I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like @NUM4 hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after @NUM5 hours in line the mist fans @DATE1 to lift. Patience can bring luck. I wait for what seems like only ten minutes but accaully was an hour. After I got off the ride, I was releaved. I guess patience in some ways, is the key to success.
1	20	19	Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners.
1	17	16	Sometime it can be hard to be patient, @CAPS1 me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C.I had just turned @NUM1 and was going to meet president @PERSON1 face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the white house a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around @NUM2 then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited played hangman and saws other @CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30pm @PERSON1 came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?""I said ""yes""….we went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 having to wait, but I didn't care it care it was worth it.

4	10	14	This is a story about patience, one day my friende tells me hey did you ever be patient. I told him no I have never in my life been pacients, well you should he told me. One day my frend is telling my new game is coming out and I just talk why he was talking  I can tell that he did not like it at all, so in class I  am telling every one that I won him in race. But I had no patients on me so I stoted complaining to him I said  I won   and he said  you have no patienc and it  kepted going on and on. Then my other friend said stop it right now! I am sick and tired of this you have no patients and you lost @NUM1 game! Ok some time we all have complained in are life! Just stop fighting please. So the next day I said do you have eny thing to tell me I will listen better now. I learnd that I should listen to what people have to say then talk that will  get  are friend ship to the next leveal.
1	14	13	Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: t cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just can’t wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but I’m not. I’m not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I don’t think that will happen anytime soon.
2	16	14	Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patience because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a pisered   since birth. It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I’m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She’s improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don’t yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience.  So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will @CAPS1.
4	21	17	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you”@CAPS1 be patient? Recently @CAPS2 been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasn’t enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (@CAPS3) I really don’t like eating in our living room it @CAPS1 seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So that’s a good thing. Idon’t know how much longer I can keep up with this. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient.
3	12	9	Today I had to @CAPS1 Patient @CAPS2 of the meap. The meap is a @NUM1 to @NUM2 day @CAPS3. It has writing, reading, math. It is the hardest thing you will have to do in school. I think it is the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn a lot more and it might help with your future jobs.
0	14	14	As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I’m older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I don’t care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don’t want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don’t say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help.
2	20	18	“@CAPS1 go!”, I yelled while running to the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. “@CAPS4 a minute, you got to @CAPS4 for your friend”, my mom said. As I stopped to @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5 brother @PERSON2 I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. “@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8”, I said histaticly. “@CAPS9, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the back”, my mom said. “@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!”, @PERSON2 yelled. As we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a @NUM1 minute @CAPS4 for us to go. After we got in line I thought to myself, wow this is a long line. It wasn’t that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. “@CAPS11!”, the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. “@CAPS12!”, everybody said when we took off.  After that I told myself I can be patient.
1	17	16	Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home!
0	14	14	I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive.
2	17	15	In my life there has been many times were I have been patient and times when have hot been patient. For example the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to target I could got gum. My mom said you but I had to with a little bill. I was patient by waiting for my mom to take me. When I got to target my mom told  me to ???  up. I ran into  the ???  in the  pay ???  so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad I was patient. Also instead of my mom getting mom she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is, about. Week ago when I asked my dad do play ??? with  me. He said  you but  you have to wait a whiler. I got very mad for some reason and lost my patience. I started yelling why I have to wait. I then reach  I was having rate and that I lost any patience. I said sorry and then we played  catch.
0	20	20	When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw at cedar point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the @CAPS1.  The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things.
7	21	14	I was patient when I was at my friend’s house in the winter shoveling a sleding slot so we can but water on it to make ice. When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didn’t bother me at all. That’s how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But… I couldn’t  or we couldn’t go on it that night because it was to late. I that’s my story about  patientce  The @CAPS1
0	20	20	I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient.
1	14	13	One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help and so did the kid in front of me. It took him a while but I just stood there and waited. It took him around @NUM1 minutes because he needed help with a lot of thing. That is the time I was patient.
4	24	20	When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice. “@CAPS2 this is going to take forever!” I whined. “@CAPS3’t be so negative. It’s not that long.” @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. “@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game?” @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS7, when you’re patient, you get food!” @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home.
2	16	14	Two years ago my dad had surgery on his because he broke it at work .I had to sit in a waiting  room  for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do .Every two hours my mom ,grandma ,grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch .After about four hours I got really  tired ,but didn’t fall asleep .That was the longest I’ve sat in one place my entire life .At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two .
4	20	16	One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tryed to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. When we realized it wasent coming off we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him we asked for bolt cutters. We had o walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had them we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there he tryed to cut the lock. He tryed for @NUM2 min. They wouldent work. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @NUM3 min. I think this took a lot of patients from coach @PERSON1.
4	18	22	Once upon a time their was a princess named @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 was invited to a royal ball where @CAPS1 awaited her handome prince. As her carriage  arrive @CAPS1 stalked at the people before getting out. Finally @CAPS1 stepped out of the vehicle. @ORGANIZATION1 walked down the red carpet. As @CAPS1 arrived, the more noisy it got the princess finally aproched the opened doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and warched the village people dance among her. @PERSON1 sat for two hours. @CAPS1 wandered “will he show up?” and “  will he like me?” @CAPS1 doubted her luck. The princess grabed the microphone, “@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Does @CAPS3 know where my prince is?” “@CAPS3?” a complete silence went over the croud. Finally at the last minute. ‘@CAPS4” an anonomyse voice crosered. I am the prince!” A sigh of relif came over her. “@CAPS5 I’. I’m so late ??? fought a dragon and a thousand knights. To get here  to meet my love!” awwwww! The crowd said softly. And they lived happily ever after. The @CAPS6!
7	9	16	The @CAPS1 out in @DATE1. One day when my aunt @PERSON1 was watching me and all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse so my aunt @PERSON1 and she went to go fix it and it didn’t work so she ??? calling my mom and he connection got lost so then we got our generator and watched the news and my mom got stuck in the highway ??? I was worried so the we finally got our phones to work and some of are family came and we were so mad cause nothing worked for a week and we had to be very patient.
4	8	12	I think patience means when your calm and you don't care what somebody @CAPS1 @CAPS2 doing, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of patience @CAPS2 when your mom @CAPS2 shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store and you stay there that a good sill of patience a bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you throw a bit of the store, @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when your at @CAPS3 amusement park and theres a @CAPS7 long line And you don't complain that's a very good sign of patience . A bad sign of patience In that situation @CAPS2 that you complian the whole time. . @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom and you just wait until she gets out. A bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you brake down the door and you have to pay for @CAPS9. Asked @CAPS6 good sign of patience. @CAPS2 when your locked out and for go to your friends house.
1	9	8	One day I was at a baseball game in @LOCATION1 and the line was huge it stretch out for half a mile and we were at the end. So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very very patient or else my dad would’ve gone crazy, so that’s my story about patience.
0	24	24	“@CAPS1 kids. Today @CAPS10 are going to look into our microscopes. I will pick your partners.” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 picked @CAPS2 to be my partner. I think she is really smart. @CAPS10 were assigned to microscope” The teacher told us @CAPS10 had to draw everything @CAPS10 see in our notebooks. @CAPS2 looked into the microscope, and saw blue lines scattered everywhere. “@CAPS3, can I see?” I asked. “@CAPS4 I have to draw it in my notebook.” @CAPS5 @CAPS2. “@CAPS1, @CAPS17 hurry up.” I @CAPS5, not noticing I was being impatient. “@CAPS8, who can accept @PERSON3 in their group? He needs  a partner.” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised her hand. “@CAPS10 can!” @CAPS5 @CAPS2. “@CAPS12! Really @CAPS2?” I complained. “@PERSON2, don’t be rude. You know he is new to our @CAPS8.” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON3 walked over, got a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for @CAPS2 to draw what she saw in her notebook. “@CAPS2, can you go any slower?” I shouted. “@CAPS17, can you yell any louder?” she shouted back. Finally it was @PERSON3’s turn. He looked at the microscope and started drawing. I tried to peek at @CAPS2’s paper. She noticed, and I quickly glanced back. “@PERSON2, you really need to @CAPS4 your turn and be patient. @CAPS10 will all get a chance to look through it.” @CAPS2 @CAPS5 to me. “You’re right. Thanks @CAPS2. I’m sorry I was acting like that.” I @CAPS5. “it’s alright, I act like that too, @CAPS3, maybe @CAPS10 should all sit together at lunch.” @CAPS5 @CAPS2. “That would be cool.” @CAPS5 @PERSON3.

4	24	20	Have you ever been patient before? Well l have l was sitting there in a nice warm and cozy seat exhausted dozing off waiting for them to say the came @PERSON1. It kept going throught my mind @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so l just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silence orthodonist office. I kept asking myself things like I wonder what their gonna do today, I wonder if I'll get my expander off or what about my top braces. Then l starting to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out ""@CAPS1"" l was excited and nervous at the same time but l was proud because l had sat there the whole time patiently.
1	11	10	Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. I have been patient many times. For instance when my mom uses the phone late till she gets of to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie are play begins. I am most patient during tests. Like this one the mean patience is very important. If you dont have patience to some people that is anrcoying. If i didnt have patience I would be a completely???person people would mind me very amount and every they would @CAPS1 get along with me so inside of bothering someone @CAPS2-stop be patient.
2	13	15	When dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. Elderly often @MONTH1 become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks @MONTH1 be hard for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. That is how I feel about the word patience.
0	12	12	Patience is very important, it can help you be successful in many things. In school patience is very important because some things just have to wait. Being patience in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other persons makes his or her move  you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting. For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and can’t wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also on your birthday you don’t know what you’ll get but instead of peeking you have to be patient you can open the presents up. Patience is a very helpful skill to have
1	14	13	Sometimes its hard to be patient, especilly when you have to be tolerant to little kids. Well I have to do that sometimes, when I go to visit my little cousin, @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old and get on my nervers. She asks dumb questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom says, ""When you grow up, you two will be best friends,"" @CAPS1, right, I don't think so. When ever I visit her I just have to tolerant her and be patient. For now I have to deal with her, but when we grow up we might become  friends, but maybe not.
0	24	24	Here I was on @CAPS1 third day of volley ball tryouts. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way.
0	16	16	One sunny after noon I was so waited because. I was going to see my faveret band. When I’m in school! My mom picked me up from thired gread I was so excited it was time to go. My dad droped my broter of at my grandma’s house (he was only at doy so he could not go.) I was bounsing of my seut “mom are we there yet?” I ask “@CAPS1 we have two more hou’re to we are there, then a nother hour, so we are going to see the place here.”mom said  “@CAPS2, can I have my d.v.d please.” I side. So now it has been two hours I’v been in the car. Then we went every were my mom and dad wanted to go not were I wanted to. Then it was time to go see. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! When we aroved I was a little sleepy but that would not stop my. When they only plaed two song I want to sleep on the seet. I wated all day to see them and I went to see. That was a time I was patient to see my faveret band.
1	17	16	The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don’t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don’t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!
7	22	15	Once upon a time there was a preeteen name lola @CAPS1 lived in a land called wounder land and lola was a single queen @CAPS1 had lots of money and food and @CAPS1 had a big house but there was one thing that lola was missing @CAPS3 was a preteen prince there were lots of boys thowing themselves at her but not one of the cute strong preteen boys was the one for her. So one day @CAPS1 wanted to go to the village and see all her people and they were very happy to see her they yelling her name llola lolal and telling her that is was the best queen they ever had. Then after they stop yelling her name @CAPS1 saw a cute and strong preteen prince and has name was @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 fell in love and went over there and said hello and he said @CAPS4. Then @CAPS1 said do you want to come to my place and have diner and he said yes. Were do you live and @CAPS1 said in the big place he said ok see you at six. He did not know @CAPS1 was a queen so he went to the place and they at carb legs then after diner they played veido games afer that they started to like each other. Then a month later the were boyfriend and girlfriend everything was going good. @CAPS1 wanted him to ask her to marrie her but @CAPS1 had to wait patiently and @CAPS1 did @CAPS1 waited a year and he still did not ask her to marrie him. @CAPS1 new that if @CAPS1 ask him @CAPS3 would not work out so @CAPS1 wait and @CAPS1 waited some more and he tell didn’t ask her so the next day @CAPS1 went out with her friends @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, feanne and @CAPS5 and they went to the @CAPS6 and they sat in the mud bath and they were talking about how @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 were doing and @LOCATION2 said they were doing good. @CAPS3 is just won’t ask me to marrie him I don’t think he wants to ask me but we liveing together. The next day @CAPS1 @CAPS1 came home and all her friend and family were in her house and in front of everyone he ask her to marrie him and @CAPS1 said yes and everyone was happy for her and he said I was going to ask you I just wanted @CAPS3 be one you will never forget and @CAPS1 ask her friends if they knew and they said yes everyone knew we just couldn’t tell you. A year they had a big wedding @CAPS3 was so perty and @CAPS3 was the wedding of the village and everyone was there and they partyed all night. The @CAPS7.
1	18	17	It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now.
1	19	18	Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a gon??? and your not patient maugio wait  your turn here not going to hire you, here not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 but we had to leave at @DATE1 am so I couldn’t go to sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I was tired. I couldn’t take a nap because if I did the nap will turn into a deep sleep. Next I and to finish packing ?????????? so I  was really tired and  ?????????? show I was ran because it was  a hour left. When I was done packing. I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I can’t go to sleep under a ????????. Then   my cousin  had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was @CAPS1 about to get ????????????????? called at and said “let’s go.” I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van.  In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience.
0	22	22	That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole @NUM2 hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little.”
4	14	10	Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift.
0	12	12	Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can’t stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I’m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.
1	13	12	Patience @CAPS3 a sense of tolerance. Having ‘’the patience’’ means that you can wait, it will come to you if you just wait. like when you gobble your food down thinking its going to he stolen, when really, you could have left it there and yet it would still there. Patience @CAPS3 knowing that everything @CAPS3 going to be ok and you have time. Having patience to do somthing, @CAPS3 to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @CAPS3 qenrally how long you can wait to do somthing, or even put up with something. Patience could also mean now long you can put up with somthing, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before your just pushed off the edge and you cant take it any more! THAT’@CAPS1 @CAPS2 PATIENCE @CAPS3.
2	6	4	Patience is about whaiting and having what for staff you want like if I wont anything Patience is that you have to what before you get it. So patience, it means that you have to what in a good maner
3	16	19	A time I was patient is now @DATE1. The reason is because I am waiting for @CAPS1 new phone. See in @DATE2, I spelled orange juices on @CAPS1 phone. Everybody would call me weired and responsible. At first @CAPS1 phone was fine and everything alright. Then one day @CAPS1 speaker stopped working. I could call anyone or  listen to music. @CAPS1 heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1 dad and told him about @CAPS1 problem. He first lasted and shook his head. Then grabbed @CAPS1 phone to test it. After he disconnected it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned,so i couldn’t figure it. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1 dad. I told anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a why are you laughing dad. He said “You are going to have to wait until I get the money.” @CAPS1 face was calm but here I am still waiting for the phone.
8	19	11	@CAPS1's cold @CAPS1's raining, I'm wet @CAPS1's been @NUM1 hour and still no activity. All I have to do is wait. I'm hunting deer hitting with my new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 bow. I'm a decent shot but not that good. I know patients is the key to deer hunting so I will just have to wait. I now see a deer about @NUM2 yard away and shoot @CAPS1 so my patience pays off
4	22	18	I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my @NUM1 @CAPS2. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten soit was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running @CAPS4 it and “@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 it. The party started at @NUM2 am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I keeped @CAPS4 asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldn’t wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and curds. I guess all that waiting really payed off. I also got some really cool presents.
5	22	17	I had a friend well she is @CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from @NUM1 grade then in @NUM2 grade she said she said she has to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of @CAPS4 mom friend calls me and I told  @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best  friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she  was still o the phone. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 moms friend said can you get me a glass of water and @CAPS4 moms five other friends said the some thing. I went and got them water. After that @CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash so I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took at the trash out the like @NUM4 mins I had her waiting. When I took out the trash @CAPS4 best friend was and she said @CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit and I forget all about @CAPS4 friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 min. then said I got to go back inside. I ment in and sat on the sof and @CAPS4 moms friends that were over are house were talking and I sat with than talking laughing, playing, and watching t.v.  After two hours and a half while I am watching t.v. I tell myself what am I forgetting. I knew I forget something, but I didn’t know what so I get up and I walk around the whole telling myself what  did I forget when I get to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 in I seen the phone on the bed and I picked up and said @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there even if I had a feeling she didn’t which did. She told me you kept me waiting for the longest time ever. I told her wow your so patient I would never wait that long. She come on you’re @CAPS4 best friend. I would wait forever for you so we continued talking.
3	16	19	A time that I was patient was during the @DATE1. My @CAPS1  @PERSON1 was nice enough to invite me to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with her family acoarse my pacents said yes. It was a @NUM1 hour @CAPS4 I think to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS7 it was fun cuz we brought lots of things to keep us buisy, we watched a movien on my @ORGANIZATION1, listened to music I had no trouble waiting till we got there. When we got to the hotel we picked are bads then jumped in the car to go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @NUM2 awesome. First few went on the @CAPS10 my eyes were watering it was so scary, then the music, it was so fast I felt like we were going to fly of the tracks. Next we we wanted to go on the malliniom force @CAPS7 the line was a hour long and we were in the middle of it. So it would useless to try to escape the line, then finally it was areturn to go, @CAPS7 it wasn’t working so we had to wait, it wouldn’t copperate so he told use that we can get free passes to go on any ride, and cut ahead of everyone @CAPS7 we only got to do it once. As you see us being patient , rewanted us, I think it was so worth it!
1	13	12	When I was patient I remember writing an article at sea world when I  was very little. I didn’t complain because I knew I would get those sometimes my sister was complaining being she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for @NUM1 minutes for a role called @CAPS1 drop, or something like that I can’t remember. Then there was a line at the ??? for ???. We waited @NUM2 minutes plus the time for every to get out.
1	19	20	One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctor’s because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor’s office’s and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told it will only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some games. I actually brought my @CAPS1 with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said “how are you sweety”, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. after the ??? I was patient at the clinic so then we spent @NUM1 minutes. Here so I ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? to sleep. I was ??? ??? Because I was patient its not that ??? believe ??? its actually easy. That’s a ???

4	17	21	Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn’t sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted.
5	22	17	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room. Folder laundry and watched television. It was about @DATE1 and she still wasn’t home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it.
1	14	15	One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying ‘’do we really have to go’’ of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said ‘’lets go in the waiting room’’. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient. And that is the story of when I was patient.
3	13	16	I have to be very patient for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet @NUM1 in @DATE1. So it kinda hard for me to be patient about that beacuse my mom and my sister are planning so much at one time. It gets hard for me to relax while they go out and get stuffs for party and on top of that we are taking a trip to @LOCATION1 before her birthday. So we have a lot of planning to do in a month in a half.It’s very hard, she has to be patient. Watch my mom?? ?? plan a party and still be able to ?? on the trip to @LOCATION1 with my family. All my life, I have lived ?? being patient but it  ?? ?? ?? ?? try to be patient ?? ?? ?/ ?? ?? ?? ?????????
1	12	11	I do not have the much patience because this year I’m getting a laptop every day I look up one I have I cant down I my iPod, I keep talking to my family about it I do not go a senond without thinking about my laptop I have everything ready for one but I have to wait. Waiting for a laptop is not the only thing I had to have patience for. Last year for @CAPS1 I got an iPod favor but I had to wait till @CAPS1 eve because my family pitched in we bought it on black @DATE1 so I looked at youtube vidoes on iPod touchs because I could not wait any longer. It is hard to have patience when you want something when you already have it.
0	19	19	Patience is an important thing to have. If helps you and other respect yourself. If you are not patient things will only get worse. My cousin is a big @PERSON1 fan. She wanted tickets to his concert, but when the sold out online she didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1’s face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin would had been so patient she would have gotten the tickets. Patients will get you @NUM2 long way, especially if it trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be @NUM2 patient person, and maybe I will get concert tickets someday.
3	19	16	One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs.
0	16	16	There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly for a monthly chek up. When we got to the building my aunt and I relized that there were more cars there than usuall. When we stepped inside we noticed that a flier said “@NUM1 shots @DATE1 threw @DATE2.” @CAPS1 when we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room we seen @NUM2 people. Luckly not all the people were waiting for @PERSON1, but I did have to wait for an hour and fortyfive minituts. @CAPS1 when I finally got to see my doctor she gave me my shot and made shure I was ok. After a long day I went home took a big nap.
2	9	7	I was being pationt when I was waiting for my own phone so I cam text my friends and call them and more. I was also waiting for to get my own snowmoble licens so I can ride my own snowmible on the troils. Know  matter what you are always be patient.
6	22	16	I was at the detrait airport. It was around @NUM1 am,the sky was bright and gloomy but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing in my face. My mom,brother and @CAPS1 through the tall metal doors and saw everything from gift shops to our destiny where we would @NUM2.We got our tickets and headed off into the plane.We went through metal detectors that caught nothing but my leather striped pink and brown belt.I slipped it back and started walking.When we entered the plane we passed alot of people i did’nt know.I got the window seat,and there my mom,brother, and i sat in  carnined blue chair s waiting in excitment and  fear to fly off into the sunshine state
1	17	16	A time when I was patient was when I was at my football and the defence hid the was in and I was waiting to go back in. Then finally my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball an dthe offense including me ?n in on the field, and then they had me run it up the middle and I scored and then we passed it for the two point conversion and it came to me but it was high and it tipped it then it came right down in my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because the defence ?? back in but then it was half time. I am the kick returne and we got the ball as I got the kick and returned it all the way for a touchdown and it was really cool because my tem was bleding and I broke a lot of tackles. Then it was the @DATE1 the all the other ?? we doing kneeing it and finally my ?? swotted the pass and if one a ?? the my team jumped on it and we had the ball then our full back got a pass and got the game wining touch down and thats atime when I had to be patient
3	8	5	Patience. What is patience? Patience is waiting for something calmly. Its waiting for the right time to propose, or ask her on a date. Life is going to be hard unless your patient. You need to be patient when getting a job.
3	21	24	A time when I was being very patient was when I went to “@CAPS1” at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called “The dead zone”, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say “were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called “The mauerie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I don’t think so.
4	16	12	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave.
2	10	8	I think patience is a time when you have to be calm. It is also a time of wateing. For some people being patient is extremely hard. But for me it’s easy. At times I can be inpatient, but everyone can be. Being patient is kinda new racking, but I manage. A lot of times I get mad if I have to be too patient. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world don’t like to be patient. with patience comes a reward is you are really patient!
1	20	19	The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead” and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong
3	12	9	Patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. I think patience is calm, doesn’t lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience
0	24	24	Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 step-dad, @NUM1 of   @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and, @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and sack. The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient
4	16	12	I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.
4	12	16	Their was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop and my family and I was going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so that’s when my mom called my phone and asked me was I done because I been up their from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and she said go to some one else chair because was was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff will be leaving at @NUM3 a.m the next morning.
5	18	13	One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were some were in my room so I looked every were. After twenty minutes went by I still could not find them but my dad was still patient: I deystroyed my room looking for his keys, they were not in my dresser, closset, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car and now the keys are gone then when I went to tell my dad who was being so patient for a hour I fond them in my pocket.
2	17	19	There was a kid named @PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for every else and he never complained. That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bath rooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honered and also happy. That night was the best for @PERSON2
1	14	13	A time when I was patient. Was when I went to the book story and I woned a book. I was at the book store and I wanted a book called tayler swift back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she know I love tayler swift book and her life. As soon as I got it I stared reading it. My mom said thank you for being patient I was you welcome I said thank you for buying it. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store and she said not today and I keep on asking and she said not and I keep on asking and she said maybe. So I was and the car listen to radio and we when to the mall and there was a book store in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find the bok that you wonted I find it and she bote it. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and dont keep asking.
1	20	19	Over the @DATE1 my dad, my brother and I went to @CAPS1 point. It was really hot but we didn’t care we really wanted to ride the millennium force. We found the ride but we first looked at the line it was huge. It shaked almost around the whole ride twice, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found our cover selves under a tent they put up so it was some what cool in line. So we waited a longer and longer till my brother started to flip out yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, “I can’t wait here any longer” @CAPS2 he went under the ?? and ?? off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finnaly, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here so l decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When l got on they still weren’t there, well the ride took off and they weren’t the best ride ever with me.
3	12	15	Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1 we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.
0	8	8	When I was patien we had to wait in a line for a @CAPS1 coster I was scared of some kids in line were unpaitent and wanted to get on the @CAPS2 fast I was patient and waited util  we got on I was verry scared when I were on When I got off I had a smile on  my face I was glad I was patient
2	13	15	I was patience when I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hours just to ride ???. Then I got on it took off @NUM2 miles pa hour. I was stuck to it for five minutes then it went down ??? @NUM2 miles pa hour. I got off and rode it miles cum force and I was faced to it. The drop is ??? . The ride was @NUM1 minutes long ??? @NUM5 people. I went on the powa hour it was sence. My ??? was the reply it was fun to. I came home as it was in the @TIME1. I woke up and ate breakfast. The whole time is waied patience in everyone.
1	23	24	To @CAPS4 being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. That’s what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasn’t going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music.” mom that our favorite song.” @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said “you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here.” @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. “lets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said, “ @NUM2 hours later”. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. “@CAPS8 you don’t crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal.” @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next.” The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. “@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I want”. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there  life just like @CAPS4
1	16	15	A time when I was patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was waiting to get on the dragster the line was suppa long. We waited for @NUM1 hours long and we still was in line being patient. Finally we got up there and they said that the ride will be closed   for a while that have to check something and it took them a whole hour for them to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and we were waiting for the train to come and it came it took the train @NUM2 minutes and when we got to the other side of the park the ride I wanted to get on which was shoot the rapids the line was really long so we waited and waited and finally it was our turn we got on it was fun then when it was over we got back. On the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster then the line was back long and we waited and waited and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait that was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long I was about to lose my mind but we had don. And we are going back this @CAPS3.
5	14	19	It was @DATE1 when   my family and I went to cedar point. It was really exciting and fun. The trip was about three or six hours long. I went to sleep but when I wake up we was at burger king.  I ordered we a kids meal and it was good. so  as  we  got  back  in the  car I stayed up the  rest  of  the way there.  Then I start seeing water parks and hotels it was really nice. Then I seen this really tall roller coaster   I got really excited that I ran to the line, bed they were all long. I had a wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was my tom in like  I was so  happy and  excited   that  when I got  my   stamp  I ran  to the @CAPS1-@CAPS2  in  door  roller  coaster. So I had to  wait  an hour  in line , so I got  really tired, but I kept mouing  forward, when I reached the  stairs  finally I got  on the  ride. I was binda scared at the sometime because it was dark. then  we  took off then it  got  off I was  dissy, but I went  on another  ride  and  got  disser. I got on this ride that rocks side to side. His is the time I was patient.
2	8	6	A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want.
3	22	19	Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!
2	13	15	There haven’t been many times were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!
5	8	13	Patience is truly the hardest thing and body really ? that a ?.I hard to because im on punishment for not doing what I was suporse to do. So I have to be patient it and what it out until it was being patient it is what for a perfect of team to did. From my pop it of how. So while im on punishment I just waiting it out so my time will come because I can’t speed up there and just make it ??? quicker but it  I could  I would but  for now I have to want. Im a permanent for quite a while so I can just be patient .I know before taking it hard but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do it patience also helps the maker  and cam saved you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can want for certainly things like; money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transportation, and things of the sudn because at you post rush every thing you want get it the way you were surpose to but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!
2	19	17	I rember this hot @DATE1 day I WAS on my way to the @CAPS1 / octhndontist. And /left school bEcAUSE it was the second to lost day, And I left school about fourty-five minutes @CAPS2. My oppointment wAs @CAPS3 @CAPS4-thirty. So / @CAPS5 @CAPS3 the @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 lifteen @CAPS4 was About @CAPS4 people @CAPS3 and of me.

I felt so happy for myself for being so patient, And I got A tooth-break for being patient!
3	16	13	One day I had to put up with my big brother all day. He went to get a cell phone I wanted one to but I was to yang to get one. So when he found out I couldn’t get one he naged me. I wanted to take that phone and break it but I didn’t because I played it cool so when he got back home I walked away from all of the naging. I went to do something else but he kept following me so I found a big thoe that he could not get up to and hang out there till he left. After that I went to go in. But I had got locked out I thought man shoube I have got a plane? Thanks for listening
1	16	15	There’s many times I’ve been patient @CAPS1 this one time, my little sister kept buging me, and I didn’t scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said “no”, she through a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she get hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was desterbing me. I didn’t become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person.
0	16	16	Patience. My cousin ??? most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor, he must go through eight years of college. Eight years of termanology, teaching cells, learning human anology he has to be patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complain about homework or school or anything has got the highest patient ??? trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college which means four down four to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his??? It’s not easy being motivated and relaxed ??? does that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1 he told me patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is patient.
1	15	16	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm.
3	24	21	One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain.’’ @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane’s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6’s back turned.’’ @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.’’ @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances.
2	14	12	Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I don’t really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too!

0	11	11	I have to be patient when I’m taking the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I’m patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .I sometimes have to wait forever .But that’s fine I can just take a nap .I sometimes hate being patient .It just frustrates me .Waiting for like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test .It’s good because you shouldn’t rush on the @CAPS1. Its justs frustrates me that people take so long .It’s not just at school it’s at my house too. The doctor, dentists at a friends house and and at the library. Man this is so hard to be patient .But it’s not good  to be  in patient .I wish people were as fast is  I am during a test .Then I wouldn’t have to be very patient.O well I guess I’m just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient.
0	13	13	One time I was patient??? was my dad was going to sent me a @CAPS1 present. I was just waiting and waiting for it. While I was waiting I just and my??? day I sleep, are, play games invites class a lot, and watch tv, after two week I only got it, it was @ORGANIZATION1 dangs game and one houndred dolar, I call my dad and said, thank you after he played my game all night and save my hundred dollar until my birthday.

2	12	10	The time I was patient was when I was wait on my mom to have her @CAPS2. The reason why is becaus she was being a pain to me. She was mean and every thing. So I was lik oh my @CAPS1 she need to have this @CAPS2 so all this can be over and done with. This was when she was oly @NUM1 months so I know that I had to be so patient with her antill the @NUM2 months was over.

0	14	14	The place I was paitent it was at my mom’s doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was small and I had to wait out at the lobby and it was boring. I first started watching chanel @NUM1 news it got intrusting. Then I went at the front counter got a blue pen plank piece of paper then begun drawing when I finish drawing  it look like a car that look as, it was a far car; and then I began looking something to do. I begaing finding and finding and then ther  was a car magazine and there was cool cars low riders, exotic, costome, and more.When my mom was done I was patient and then we left home
1	17	16	I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday @DATE1 I was over my dads house. My dad asked me were do I want to go for my birthday. I didn’t know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him I’m done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasn’t going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars and we have went. And now until this day I am still being patient.
0	16	16	Patience you are under standing and tolerance experaners differ allys with out complaining. I will tell you about a time wen I was patient. “I gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall” @CAPS1 you don’t bye me this” @CAPS2 yelled. That is an exsampel of black mail one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six year old girl that I baby sit.one day she was at my house we wer playing a game that involved kiking a showe into a wall. Wen it was my turn I kiked the shou into the wall literally. My mom came home and I told the boys did that of corse she bileved me. But the one thing I had to do with was that thair was a witness. The six year old that cant keep a secret. I told he not to tell my mom because @CAPS1 she did I would get in big troble and she would not be abel to come over any more. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of black mail she said she would tell my mom @CAPS1 I didn’t buy her icecreem. I a @NUM1? F day. I refused to  buy her ice creem so she told my mom my mom didn’t care.
0	24	24	@PERSON3 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Vincenta was walking one day and @CAPS9 saw his friend @PERSON5. â€œ@CAPS3, a - @PERSON3â€. Said  @PERSON5, â€œ@PERSON5 you know to call me @PERSON3â€, replied @CAPS4. (@CAPS5-shen-tay) â€œ@PERSON3, my mami told me to sec  that @CAPS12 beans get to @PERSON1. Would you do it for me? â€œ@PERSON5 asked â€œcee, @CAPS21 of @LOCATION2 has eachothers backs.â€ @CAPS6 you @CAPS28! I have to go now! Bye!â€ @PERSON5 said as  @CAPS9 ran off. @PERSON3 walked over to @PERSON2â€™s house and knocked on the door. @CAPS16 answer. @CAPS7 @PERSON3 walked over to @LOCATION1â€™s old house. Abandoned,â€ I know! Iâ€™ll @CAPS8 them here!â€ @CAPS7 @CAPS9 dug a hole and planted the beans. @NUM1 minutes later @CAPS9 was still waiting. â€œ@CAPS8!â€ @CAPS9 yelled. @PERSON4 was walking and soul @PERSON3 angered. â€˜@CAPS4, @CAPS14 you a screaming boy? You gonna wake up my papi!â€ @CAPS11 exclaimed, â€œ@CAPS12 stupid beans donâ€™t grown @PERSON4.â€ @CAPS9 replied, â€œ@CAPS14 do you want to see beans? Go to bed theyâ€™ll be where under!â€ @CAPS11 told him. â€œ@CAPS16! I am here staying! Eizel will support me on this one, havenâ€™t you heard of that â€œ@CAPS17â€ guy?â€ â€œ@CAPS18, @CAPS19 will see you later @PERSON3.â€ And @CAPS11 strolled off. The next day @PERSON5 walked by â€œoh my a god! @PERSON3â€@CAPS9 yelled. @PERSON3 woke up and couldnâ€™t belive what @CAPS9 saw. The bean stalked ran @CAPS21 over @LOCATION1â€™s two story house. â€œ You stink!â€@CAPS20 cavd @CAPS21 of a sudden @PERSON3 woke. It was a dream,@CAPS9 looked at the @CAPS23. â€œ@CAPS24!â€ still nothing.   A day later @CAPS9 was still waiting hungry and tired, @PERSON4 came by again. â€œ@PERSON5 doesnâ€™t know, does @CAPS9? Well, @PERSON3 please come inside and forget about the seeds. â€œ@CAPS16â€, @CAPS9 screamed. â€œYouâ€™re just going to anger yourself â€œ@CAPS16! Go away! @CAPS9 screamed.â€@CAPS27! I will â€œand @CAPS11 stomped off once again. Two @DATE1 of waiting and finally popped up. One was alive and lasted @NUM1 minutes then died. The other was just a car bolt. @PERSON3 had bone bugs for the @DATE1 and was putting inside air @NUM3. Then @CAPS9 asked himself, â€œWas it worth it?â€ cee-yes @CAPS28-friend
0	13	13	One day when I was walking put side I found a snake on a rock. I yelled for my big brother who was playing his game. He said” hold on I need to beat the leavie “ but the snake was getting eratatid sot said,” now garrid its leaving finally after ten minutes he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand. He asked me “why do you have a snake “I re plied “I saw it cool.” he liked I and let it go.
2	12	10	One of the many times I was patience was when my @CAPS1, my @CAPS2 and I went to a restrant. We oderd our food and found a tabil. We were siting there waiting  for the food. I ask my @CAPS1 ""@CAPS3 much longer its going to take?"" @CAPS4 said ""you have to be pactien and waitie"". And then a little after the our food was done. It was toatlly worth it.
1	16	17	When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything what everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren’t to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and I passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I’m not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me. I hope I’ll never have to do that again.
4	23	19	“@CAPS1 on”. Said my little brother. @CAPS2 line is tacking forever. “@CAPS2 is the last time we are coming on @CAPS2 ride”. The ride that we were on was space mountain at @ORGANIZATION1 land in @LOCATION1. As we got into line at the ride there was a sighn I have and @NUM1 min wate from @CAPS2 point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking smil. The line would not go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand we were standing in line in @NUM2 weather. I was being as patience as I could be I just stood in line wish, hoping to pay self we could get on the oder. The first hour went by and another sighn came up @NUM3 hour from @CAPS2 point. We all got mad. The walk way sounded silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop or someone’s?? hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally we wated @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 ride. That was the first time I was that patient.
2	16	14	I recall once a famous madican named @PERSON1 was prefering a stunt that took enourmous amounts of pateints and courage it was named “@CAPS1 In Time”. The madichian had to stay in a block of ice for @NUM1 day’s or @NUM2 hours! The great madichian had only a sweater. He had the consiled  ice open to public as the magnificent madichian said “I could bearly hear anything”. He waited hours on and like falling down on abyiss or bottomless pit. Until the final seconds ended. The madichian as finally free. And alive
1	17	16	One day there was a little boy named @CAPS1. He was really hungry and his mom was a slow cooker. She would take forever to get done cooking. @CAPS1 was starving and he was getting real unpatient with his mother @CAPS4 @CAPS1 went outside to play with has friends. He came back home and was wishing dinner was ready. He went in the kitchen and said “mom is dinner ready”. “@CAPS3 right now” said mom. It won’t be ready until another hour. @CAPS1 was thinking what can he do until dinner is ready @CAPS4 he went to go to play his video game. It was a space ship game. The space ship was shooting other space ships to survive. @CAPS1 got bored @CAPS4 he went in the kitchen to see was dinner ready. His mom wasn’t finish @CAPS4 @CAPS1 was patient and his mom was finish less than five minutes.
1	16	15	One day i spent a night over my bestfriends house for @NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still. I wasn’t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school.The next day i was really looking foward to getting them and I comforted her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the @DATE1 and she still didn’t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. Finally she gave the back and you will never believe that am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she’s a good friend and im a patient person.
4	16	12	Today was thanks giving. We had to drive up to ??? to visit my cousins. The car was buning an @NUM1 trip. But the patience was hard I wish I hun a plane ticket out I saw cool things. I ??? to  out there we turn off the highway???and we were??? With family we sat down caught we gave  gifts wnD @CAPS1 a turkey @CAPS2.???                 Iillegible
1	16	15	One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.
0	16	16	In my thirteen years of expirience I have road many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster these is normally a two hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we got to the entrance @CAPS4 said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down.
0	10	10	When I was patient. Was when I go down the river with my dad and my two sisters (@CAPS1 @MONEY1).The only way I'm patient is when my dad says we are going from north to @LOCATION1. So I have no chose to be patient because it is a two houre trip. But there is a train track brige that my dad least use @CAPS2 off of and tack a brake and eat some lunch and the brige is about one houre ride down the river if you realy all the way but whe just me and my dad go we just slot the hole way.
3	22	19	“@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon don’t worry,” @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called “@CAPS3” person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn’t come in the mail. I’ve been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn’t. “I’ve been sitting here since ten o’clock where is the @CAPS4 track!” I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! “@CAPS5 coming” I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 that’s it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.” @CAPS10!” I sob in agony, “ why does this feeling consume me like this?” I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. “ @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!” I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!
2	24	22	I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dad’s house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I don’t really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because it’s implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun??
5	13	8	In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.
2	24	22	“so @CAPS1 do you want for your @DATE1?” “A @NUM1” “@CAPS1 else do you want?” A @NUM1” I have been wanting a play station @NUM3 for so long. It’s my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one… I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I don’t want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. “hey mom when are we having the family party?” “@DATE2.” @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isn’t patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now I’ll be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldn’t have made it. Im not very patient.
4	13	9	These storys is about times when I was patient. This is one story so one time my guardaner was puting my winter clothers away this @DATE1 and I told her like these my good clothes and I was like there not really winter clothes she said she know and she said im just puting them up because she said I had to many shrits that was same clolor and I was trying talk back then I was like o I see what you saying because I couldent fit every thing in my dresser so I patient and help her put my clothes up. Patient mean can you do something somebody ask you or can you do the right thing to people. Or can you help somebody when you think they help in something.
4	20	16	A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my present’s there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the day’s got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didn’t even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didn’t get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and app’s and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. That’s why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision that’s the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but it’s some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..I’m happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. That’s why??? can play it because I’m saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one.
3	18	15	Write in your own say about patience. @PERSON2 and his mom are on their way to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @PERSON2 been waiting his whole life to go there. Bill’s mom gets a call from cousins, @PERSON3, bob and @PERSON1, his cousins ask can they go? @PERSON2’s mom say sure. @PERSON2 is patient boy so he just lets it go. Still patient. Once @PERSON2’s mom gets his cousins, his mom gets another call from his five friends. They all ask the same question his cousins ask. His mom says yes.They each live in a different place far apart, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. Finaly there. @PERSON2 is so mad but is still patient.When his mom gets another call @PERSON2 says who is it now !?! Its his dad calling to say. I’m at the @CAPS3 with @PERSON2’s brother and sister, where are you? @PERSON2’s mom responded, I palling in now @CAPS4 is my story about patients.
5	19	24	One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said “yes”. So I went and packed some things to take because they don’t have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said “I don’t know” of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didn’t listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didn’t work because she didn’t talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said “why”. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didn’t reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back “here”. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don’t know why she didn’t talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient.
2	20	18	One time my friend told me to read this book, so l borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called “The @CAPS1 @CAPS2”. It’s also a tv show on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named @PERSON2, brother of @PERSON1 are vampires. They turned into a @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they wouldn’t die, they would become a @CAPS1. They thought @PERSON3 was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. @PERSON2 came back after @NUM1 years searching for something to help get @PERSON3 out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don’t complain while doing it.
4	24	20	It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldn’t wait till I could open them. I’ve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didn’t stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. “@CAPS1” I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied “@CAPS2 can’t afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. “@CAPS3” thank you “mom” I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the?? I got the wii and it ??, which was @MONEY1. I couldn’t believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and @CAPS4 enjoying every second of it.
3	15	12	My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting till he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was. He was sitting inside, watching tv waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could ride the @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend was being patient.
2	19	17	As my dad allways tells me, patient is one of the vary begs to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patients is important. I remember a time when I had to display patients for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to ceadar point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. “@CAPS1 ride gave me the most fan, heartstopping, andrenalin pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After @NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disapointed to find out it’s a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figure the best way to do @CAPS1 was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get to get on the ride!
4	17	21	A time I was patient is when I took @CAPS19 @CAPS1. @CAPS7 @CAPS2 test. It took two days to take the @CAPS3. @CAPS19 @CAPS3 was on @DATE1 and @DATE2, @CAPS5 @NUM1 to about @NUM2 pm. I passed @CAPS19 @CAPS6! I then had to wait (patiently) until @DATE3 the @CAPS7 @CAPS2 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 I received @CAPS19 @CAPS11 @CAPS7 @PERSON1 level one. That is/was @CAPS19 greatest accomplishments in @CAPS19 whole life so far it wasn’t easy. I started when I was five, and I am now twelve. I had to perform @NUM3 @CAPS13 I knew at the time, and about @NUM4 stances, @CAPS14, @CAPS15, @CAPS16, and blacks. @NUM5 minutes of sporring ,also called kumite (kun –@NUM6 minutes of practicle self @ORGANIZATION1. I also needed to make a poster, aparent recemendation, and teacher recamendation, @NUM7 written  report, and a written  @CAPS6. I needed  to perform a @CAPS13 and show self @ORGANIZATION1 application and do  @CAPS17 weapon skit and practicle  self  @ORGANIZATION1 skit and send in a progress report and/or most current report and card. Inconlusion  I had to  “@CAPS18” @CAPS19 @CAPS7 @CAPS2 ,[@CAPS22 @CAPS23 or person were hormed in the making of this  incredible martial artist/@CAPS24] (@CAPS25 life story )
0	8	8	On my way to @STATE1 I was patient because I had to wait for the buses. I also ??? On some stops it ?? buses @NUM1 it o @CAPS1 hes to got ??? those haves I was so tired that ?? bus got the I fell asleep.
2	17	15	When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom, and dad. @PERSON1 has downs syndromd. And he likes to wach game’s. He like’s to cheer them on whene their playing. He also like to give them hi fives after they are done playing. I did not laugh at him. I thought was a perty cool guy. He like to talk a lot about’ suff like sport’s are cartoon’s. I dident make fon of him win he talk’s. I dident win he walks and or win he make nosies that are funny. He think of every one as his filend wich they are. When he standing in line he dosent move vary much. He yell’s wen @DATE1 port has the ball and is heading for a tuch down. When he gets mad when spirg port, don’t have the ball and they score. I @CAPS1 him That we will get it @CAPS2. He say yeha I now that. So he like’s to go on to the feeld to wach. But they won’t let on the feeld yet so I @CAPS1 him to be patience so he will calm down. When the game’s over his mom take’s us to @LOCATION1 house. We sat in the @CAPS2 being roud and taking. But she did not get mad.even now we had to set in a hour traffic jame. So after all that what I think patience is.
1	15	16	A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!
0	24	24	Once upon a time there was a girl named @PERSON2. She had always dreamed to be a princess. Every present she got was either a dress or jewelry. She loved to try on dresses. She had two sisters both @NUM1(one year older than @PERSON2) there name were @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 house is an old house located in the woods. One day @PERSON2 went out to get the mail, and a man with a tuxedo on gave her a letter that looked very fancy. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud, it said “@CAPS2 @PERSON2, your invited to ball at the castle on @DATE1 at @NUM2 pm.” @PERSON2 screamed in exitment. @PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown. She found a beatifulgown but it was to much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price was I she helped around the store for a couple of days. She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And fonaly her patients paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home and put the dress on. She only had an hour so she had to hurry. She put her makeup and jewelry on and looked at her self in the mirror and said I did it. She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the gold paint. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs and every one stared. It was @CAPS3 best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce him self and when she turned around he fell in love. @PERSON2 couldn’t believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her will you marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true.
1	17	16	@PERSON1 was swinging with her friend all day when she was swinging so high that the chain came loose and @PERSON1 fell, she was screaming in pain. So they waked in the house. When they got to the house @PERSON1 was screaming and crying they all got in the car and drove to the doctors. The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 wasnâ€™t patient until her and her friend were talking. When the doctor was ready to see her she had forgot all about why she was there, @PERSON1 found out that she broke her arm. Later that day she thanked her mom and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient.
0	14	14	One rainy day my dad's leg was brothering him. He took medican but that didn't work so we took him to the hospitle in coro. They looked at his leg and they told us we had to the hospitel in covent hospitle in @LOCATION1 so we got on our way to @LOCATION1. When we got to the hospitle these was like @NUM1 people in the wating room. My dad had patience to wait. When we had to go in the room. My dad had to get x-rays. He was also had enough patience to wait to see what was wrong. When he found out what was wrong. He had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgey on his legs well after he had all the patience he had to go through surgey. He had enough patience to go through surgey. It is a good thing my dad had all the patience because his legs are all better I didn't think my dad had enough patience.
3	9	12	One time I was patient for the doctors and I had a great time. Another time I was patient, I was at the dentest. My therd time I was patient when I was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and it was boring waiting but I was patient. Last but not least I was patient to go on the tower of terror. It was the funest ride there.
3	12	15	I want to say I found her, tex right away but I did’nt. I learned something though yeah it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together. But love is, love is patient if you rtun to it it probably won’t stay with you but if wait and are patient maybe, just maybe it’ll come to you. I just have make sure I’m somewhere she can find me”. said church. @NUM1 year later. “@CAPS3 what’s thhhiiis.” @CAPS4 said “I know what this is” can I just shut the door for the night?” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. “ @CAPS6, Patience @PERSON1 were waiting for @CAPS7.”  @CAPS8 replied. “ @CAPS3 here he comes now” @CAPS10, @CAPS10.” @CAPS11 what I found I church. “@CAPS6” @CAPS4 you found the @CAPS1. Capture wait he’s in.” “do you think we have to wait for it to unlock.” When will it do that unlocky openy thing. I don’t know we will have to wait and see. That is if it will open.
0	24	24	Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.
4	13	9	Every day at launch I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especialy when your waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. But sometimes your lucky and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch you can go out ride and play. But @CAPS1 you must finish your food and throw it away and wait patienty. And thats a time when I was patient.
4	18	14	Are you patient?well I am always patient.Iam going to tell you a time when I was patient at school.One day I had to register for school it was very busy.I had to wait to every line atleast to ten to fifteen minutes.When I finally got all my paper work done,I had to take my id picture.When I took the pictures I went to get my id.All of a sudden it comes out,but my eyes were closed.So I had to wait in the line again and take more pictures.Then I went to take my other id. I waited very long,like about twenty minutes.My second id came out and it was messed up.T he lady told me when I start school,I will get the correct one.That is a time when I was patient in my life.
1	14	13	A time when I was patient I was patient on @CAPS1. I got to open are presents at nine thirtey in the morroning I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I wacth telavison. I though @CAPS2 would be hard @CAPS4 I made @CAPS2 through. That @CAPS1 I thougt was the funnest @CAPS4 I lied I think this year will be. That day I made breaskfest in bed. I actually had a lot of fun. I got my mom a couple things of purfoom. @CAPS4 of course she doesn’t use them I do I got her some candles we got my dad a bright orange sweat shirt. We also got him some @PERSON1.
3	17	20	A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasn’t one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I’ll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. That’s a time where I was patient.
2	10	8	I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy and I waited till he had time to put gas in it. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had, but he had to wait and then asked the question
3	11	14	Patients is about many things. First, there is diffrent ways to express patients. Second, people either have patients or they don’t. I admit I am one of those people that don’t have patients. My mom is always saying, “@CAPS1 your horses.” @CAPS2 I know. I don’t have patients so why does she have to tell me I don’t? I don’t have any patients in grocery shopping I can’t wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can’t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don’t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it.
3	19	16	When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing so well in math so my @CAPS1 agreed on helping study for my upcoming test. So on @DATE1 I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there. So my @CAPS1 was being really understanding and patient. So my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my @CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still try to her best ability to help me understand it. She had to helping me for about @NUM1 hours but she followed through and really helped me and I actually got a A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must have been hard to work with me for that long without losing her patience with me and I really respect that and I am very grateful to know someone like that.
1	17	18	I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my called and said she was go send me @NUM1$. @CAPS1 I asked her when she was to send it and she said @DATE3. Today was @DATE4 so that mean I had to @NUM2 days. @CAPS1 the next day had cameup  and the ???  truck came by and I thought I had mony but it wasn’t @DATE3 yet, @CAPS1 I said, “@CAPS2.” @DATE1 came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by “ @CAPS3 it! So @CAPS1 it was @DATE2 they had my favorite game on sale “The bully” the case had a yellow sticker that @NUM3 and no tax at all,@CAPS1 I was mad and @CAPS4 went home. My dad woke me up and said “its @DATE3 “ I @CAPS1 I rose up ate breakfast @CAPS1 check the mail, @CAPS1 it bills, bills,bills and “ my money” my sent we an ???. At last I said I have money, so I bought some icecream @CAPS1 I bought my favorite game “bully”. “that’s the time when I was patient.
2	19	21	Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana!  @PERSON3 is hurt!"" I yelled. ""@CAPS1? How? """"@CAPS2 bleeding by the highway at the corner as the fence @PERSON1's with him. ""@CAPS3 replied ""papa! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4!"" nana yelled ""@CAPS5  get @PERSON1 and come inside!"" nana exclaimed. ""@LOCATION1, @CAPS6 we @CAPS7 leo!"" @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, nana, and popous carried @PERSON3 (@PERSON3 is a horse) to the car port and took a look at him. Hours later of trying to keep him warm @PERSON4 arrived. They got @PERSON3 on a talk. And started to bandage him up. They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I were wating in the house trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her hourse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up. And see @CAPS1 else they could do. They stitched him up for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds would come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the folowing @DATE2. That @DATE2 came and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while @CAPS11 eventuly got belter. That's how I showed patince in the @DATE1.
2	17	15	Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you.
0	14	14	When l was patient l was in the car and my mom went to get something at the store and l went whith her. I was patient because l didn’t tell her when are we gonna go home or this is @CAPS1 boring. I tried to go whith the flow. I was there for @NUM1 hour but did I care no because l was the one who wanted to come whith and l came. If l would of complained then she would of said then “why did you come.” @CAPS1 at the end my mom said since you have been patient then you can get a chocolate bar @CAPS1 if your patient, there might be a reward at the end.
2	11	9	I was patient when I went to cediar point. I had to wait in line along tine for ??? for priencse ther was a lot of people @CAPS1 the longest word ??? drogster. I had almost anhour for a ride that @NUM1, teen  ??? that is the ???.
0	22	22	“@CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!” I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the “maverick” at @CAPS2 point. “That’s what the sign say’s, but it could take longer,” my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone “I gusse we can wait,” but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zipo, none no patience! Why did I say yeah. Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didn’t work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didn’t want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up. We were finally at the front, and I didn’t complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I was really worth it I thought. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain. That was a time I was patient
3	22	19	My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top l will @CAPS1 at (cedar point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simpily silent cvery unasul) and just waiting .I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I was about to die of boredom .My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn’t stanistrn. She was just standing there not talking. When we started to move I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient
2	21	19	We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let @PERSON2 go up to clean”  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. “friend” @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1’s  text messages. I’ll admit @PERSON1 wasn’t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!
1	11	10	One time when I was patient I was playing a football game with my friends and the other team was creaning us. But even though we were losing I still managed to stay calm and we ended up beating them, @NUM1
2	8	10	Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have.
2	8	10	You have to be paceint when you are cooking some cookie’s. It takes a long time to cook cookies. You have to be pacient when you are waiting to play a game. And you have to be pacint in the watting room until they call you’r name. You have to be pacint when you get out in a game you have to be pacint to get @CAPS1 in. When you get a home run you have to be pacint when they try to get the ball. For exaple the game of the sorry you have to be pacint to get the card @NUM1, @NUM2 if you get a one then you can get out of the house. if you get a to then you get out and get anouther turn.
0	14	14	A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at cedar point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music but that didn’t really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever.
3	19	16	One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test.

0	16	16	I’m not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I’ve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn’t complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn’t too bad. that was one of the few times I’ve been  patient, and don’t know if it counts since I was with somebody.
1	17	18	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And than I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening.
3	10	13	Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet.
2	12	10	Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.
0	19	19	‘Patience’  @CAPS1 were on are way the the big city, to go to a very specil baseball game. Can you guess what I game? It’s the “@LOCATION1 tigers,” @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 stadium, “@CAPS1 were so excited, it was the first time @CAPS1 had ever been in @LOCATION1. “@CAPS5 much longer till @CAPS1 get there?” I asked. “About @NUM1 hour, why? my mom replayed  “because its so boring siting here for four hours strait.” “I know, but you have to be patient.” “@CAPS6.” I thought in my bad. “I wounder @CAPS5 I could be patient for? I just though for a moment. Then a minite, then boom! I was out cold: for two hours I slep. Then I woke up just as @CAPS1 hit trafic. I asked “are @CAPS1 there yet”, “hope” my dad said. So I sat there waiting pacently. About @NUM2 min later I asked can @CAPS1 turn an the radio. “@CAPS7” my mom said. @CAPS1 sat there for about @NUM3 in. Then @CAPS1 finaly sarted moving handest not to be anoing, what I was going to do when I got to game. I was thinking mabey I’ll get a bit exspenedve, bur by the time I thought anything else I hurd “were here!” “@CAPS7!” I skeamed. So @CAPS1 got out of the and walked about a @NUM4 of a mile to the ticket booth. As @CAPS1 were walking up I though “I guess all it does take is patience.
4	17	13	One beautiful morning @CAPS1 went to renew his lisence. But me though if he wake up really early he would be the only one there. But of course he wouldn't be the only one there. Unfortunitly everyone thought the same thing. But @CAPS1 was really tired he woke up at @NUM1 am o'clock but they open at @NUM2 am but @CAPS1 didn't know that. So @CAPS1 went to the panacake house and got him a nice hot coffee but when he came back there was a line around the coner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited and @CAPS1 got his lisence.
2	22	20	A time when I was patient, was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We rode some rides, then @CAPS6 sister said “can we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?” I replied “sure, even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. @CAPS6 sister and I went and stood in  line for the ride. I said “we should ride front row.” @CAPS4 said “we should.” @CAPS5 we went to the front row and the line was packed. @CAPS5 we waited twenty minutes or @CAPS5 when someone threw up on another cart. The employies had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. @CAPS5 we kept waiting and waiting un till they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed “who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7,” @CAPS6 dad replied “I don’t know.” @CAPS7 day is a day that I rember @CAPS6 patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasen’t worth the wait. What was worth the wait is seeing the smile on @CAPS6 sister’s face and her laughing.
4	11	15	Come on I need some help. Sir please sit down. I will be writing about a time my @CAPS4 took a suit to a tailor for a conference. Can you please find my suit. Sir we are trying our best, we might have given it to someone else on accident. I need that suit to go to my conference. Well sir what we can do is have you pick out another suit and we will have the tailor start imediently on you’r suit o.k. I like this one. What needs to be done asked the tailor pants are to be long. I will have it done in no time, @CAPS1 me about two and a half hours thats when my plane leave for @CAPS2. I will have it done in @NUM1 minutes. I will be back here in @NUM1 minutes for waiting I will even @CAPS3 in a free tie. At the end my @CAPS4 ended up with his suit.
4	23	19	“@CAPS1,when @CAPS5 we open presents?” I asked. “@CAPS2 we get back from church” she replied. It was our typical @DATE1 schedual, make @CAPS3 eve dinner all day, go to the @CAPS3 eve service , have grand parents for dinner than all the kids get to open one present than go to bed for about one hour get up , and open more presents.  Amen,” our pastor concluded the service “@CAPS5 we go now, @CAPS1?” I blubbered “@CAPS6” she said.@CAPS8 we ate dinner I felt like I had ants in my pants, I was so excited. time seemed to go by so slow I was @NUM1 years old before my grand parents left. Finally we were all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree @CAPS8 I was about to open my present. All it was was a sleeping bag than my dad said,” you @CAPS5 all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but be sure you go to bed.” @CAPS8 I was laying on the floor, while my sister was sound asleep, I was thinking, I wonder what I‘ll get for @CAPS3. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at @NUM2. I jumped out of bed woke my sister up and ran into my parents room to wake them up. I was thinking finally we get to open presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient. But it was all paid off in the end.
2	17	19	I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient.
2	20	22	Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 was going to get her drivers licence. She was to and was so excited to be able to drive. When @PERSON1 got to the licence place she saw that there were a lot of  people waiting. She estimated about @NUM1 people were there, “@CAPS1 did there have to be so many people here,”she thought to herself. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting she got @CAPS6 mad, because only one person got his licence in the time period. She thragh a big fit  right there. “ugghh! I was supposed to get my licence today not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!” she started blabbering and said. “@CAPS1 do you guys take so long! You are so slow!” she went home and started talking to her faend @CAPS3 on the cell phone. “@CAPS2 there were many people I am never going to get my licence @CAPS3!”   “@PERSON1 just calm down. Stop being so impatient.”  “@CAPS4 the line was so long and . ’ @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1 off. “@CAPS5 you keep running home crying, you will never got your license. The line for a driver licence is always that long. I had to wait @NUM2 hours to get mine.“@CAPS6 five hours!”“@CAPS7, @CAPS4 I took @NUM4 hours with me so I wouldn’t be bored. Take your phone with you. “@CAPS8, ’’ @PERSON1 replied.The next day she went back to the licence place, she took her phone and a book with her. While she waited, she texted her friend, went online and read her book for her book project. She kept moving in the line @CAPS4 she didn’t even realize @CAPS11. @PERSON1 waited for @NUM5 hours that day @CAPS4 she only thought @CAPS11 was @NUM4 because she was preoccupied. @PERSON1 felt great when she finally got her licence, she was the second one in school in got her licence (after @PERSON2).“@CAPS9 @PERSON2, you taught me how to be patient and calm down.”“@CAPS10 problem, @CAPS11’s the least I could do for my best friend.”
2	9	11	Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn’t just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience.
1	7	8	I am always patient with my family, my mom and @CAPS1 do a lot of me and fan always patient if they take some where. Sometimes, for hockey my mom and @CAPS1 take me. Hockey. My @CAPS1 usally takes but on @DATE1 my mom takes me and I patient. For homework, I am always patient, if I go to @PERSON1’s golfland my mom, saids she will take and I’m always patient.
5	24	19	During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didn’t know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didn’t know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didn’t say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who don’t know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes won’t go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I’m not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn’t once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didn’t yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would’ve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I’m amazed at my mom’s understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too.
2	16	14	Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great jorney to california. I had to stand in six very long line for up to @NUM1 hours it took forever to get on the plain when we finaly got there we were hungry so we had to wait inline for @NUM2 minutes when we were finally up to get our food we were starving we ate and went to a friends house we stayed  for an hour it started to get bouring but I had  patience and  waited  turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life wether you are or arnt patient is up to you that week was all about patients and lines lots of both it was a long day. Sadly we had to leave after that day which equals. Yap you guessed it for patience first was had to go huston, texas then @ORGANIZATION1  then we had to drive  @NUM3 hours to get home when we got home we were so tired  and passed the story to my friends and family.
1	16	15	The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to go get my customized hat. This is the only time when I was patient. I went to the store called lio's. I picked out my hat and everything. So I said I wanted saad on their he did everything then I asked how long he said @NUM1 mineuts. We went around the mall and went back to the store that took like @NUM2 to @NUM3 mineuts. So I asked the guy is it done he said ""not yet"" I was watching him doing another guys hat. So he stopped the other guys hat, I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy so I'm waiting and waiting until he's finally done with the hat that took about an hour. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat & I was happy.
5	12	17	A time I was patient. @CAPS7 were going to go camping, so @CAPS7 got packed up and loct the car cide was @NUM1 hours long so i had to be patient. I played @CAPS4 ps @NUM2 for a cupul of minutes it was @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 left early so @CAPS7 could Do some thing when @CAPS7 got there. Then I tried to @CAPS1 I was so ticed.

3	22	19	I’m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I’m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked “@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?” @CAPS2 responded “with patience and years of practice.” The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom “@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?” @CAPS2 replies “@CAPS4, @CAPS9?” I answered “@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with”. “@CAPS6.” @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there’re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn’t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said “@CAPS8, I know you’ll catch on soon!” and I wondered out loud “@CAPS9?,’ @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper “because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.”
0	9	9	When I was patient. I was patient once or twice. One time was when I had to use the phone but my mom was on it. So I waited an hour and a half to use the phone. Another time was when I wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some pop. So I was patient while my mom got everybody ready to go to @ORGANIZATION1.
4	9	13	At the @CAPS1’s office. I had an @CAPS2 appointment. At the @CAPS2 office I was waiting in the room for her to come back. Then the @CAPS1 asked me questions and my foster mom question. Then she left out she went an found the othere @CAPS1 and talked to him. Then they came back and said @CAPS4 you. here goes the papers you need. The foster mom said ok @CAPS4 you. Then the @CAPS1 said to me, “@CAPS4 you for being patient @PERSON1. I apprisiate that so much,” “@CAPS5 to I’ll see you guys next time ok.” @CAPS5 we said “bye.”
1	20	19	A time I was patient was at my friend cousins birthday party. I was patient because the whole intire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friends parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and icecream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watch my friends cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 my friends mom said not to night because my friend has a volley ball game in the @TIME1. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when your patient you get what you want more often.
6	20	14	I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on I was a huge line! It was like a big line of domminus. I do not like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I dont wine and fuss about waiting. In my head I’m thinking when I whould get to go on the ride. I dont scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The second go on. tic tac tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later it was finnaly my turn to go on the rollercoaster I was so exited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! that line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Well on well. That line was worth it.
1	19	20	A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an @CAPS1 girl doll. I was super excited because it was my first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday. I kept waiting for the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck to come. I was dissapointed, because the shipped it from @LOCATION1 and it doesn’t take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasn’t happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom go ahed to ask when they’re going to send it and the lady said, “it’s on the way.” A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up. It was worth the wait.
4	19	15	Long ago in the land of @LOCATION1 their was a young boy named @CAPS1.@CAPS1 wanted to become a ninja like the rest of the older boys but he was to young, he was only six the years old.One day @CAPS1 came running home,he wasn’t just running he was fliping, twirling @CAPS1 was acting like fire work, @CAPS1 came bursting threw the door, and said “mama mama im @CAPS2 old enough to be a ninga” said @CAPS1, and kins mom said “ well, sorry you can’t ninja training isn’t till another six years”said kins mother, “why now when I @CAPS2 turn twelve.” @CAPS1 replied “well the sensai in still on his training, so you’ll have to be patient” so @CAPS1 waited six long years and @CAPS2 became a ninja
2	18	16	One time when I was patient was when we flew in the @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the I asked school. We flew to @LOCATION4 well and the to @ORGANIZATION1 but after that it was down hill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! after an hour I got bored with my little brother with us didn’t help at all. Then over the intereem we hear that we have to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop ??? all for @NUM1 hurs. When there was an hour left there was another announcement and it was that we will be delayed three more hours, after that I was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally get to leave we walk up to six seater phase for us to fly to a small island near by. When we got to @LOCATION1 we hurry to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours.
2	15	13	There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient.
3	14	11	I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be I am. For example at my house we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go. But I have to wait because I don’t want to jungle pee so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bust. I hate waiting its so boring. But patience is a good thing to have.  If we didn’t there would be a lot of deaths by car accidents, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient she can wait in one spot for hours one time it was @CAPS1 I was all figtxy from waiting until the bell rang so we can go trick or treating. She waited well she did her hair I complained that is a reason why patience is important.
1	12	13	My name is @PERSON1, I’m in the @NUM1 grade. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you have to know is that if have no kind of patience, you want get any where in life. Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Let’s just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you. Here’s another example let’s just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience.
5	13	8	I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. First it started out when I got a can from my friend @PERSON1 he asked me to go. So I said yes. I had to be pation derms the @DATE1. Then he drive it way long but I was pation. When we got to the entrance I felt good for being pation.
3	21	24	A time I was patient was in @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again!
1	23	24	One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep. Our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late. So I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we wake up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder @CAPS3 it could be…."" I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom ""@CAPS3's going on!?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowely brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.'' it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 ""That's like, two months away!!!.""  ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" @CAPS11 normal kids did. I said ""@CAPS12…"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said ""@CAPS14 things come to those who wait. I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like mont's to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patient got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time come for us to head on a plane for the cruise."" That quick! It went by that quick! I m so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You we're patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait.

1	3	2	I do not have patience.
3	24	21	I have lived in a lot of different. Places through out my life. They are @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2. That's @CAPS3 different place. @CAPS6 was and still is land to about to @CAPS6 @CAPS4 somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2 my parents got devased. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom (my sister and me). @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4 I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma says to not to moving and till see him soon. By soon @CAPS6 didn't think like meant @NUM2 months. In those @NUM2 months we wanted a house neat to a patch of works and a fresh water @DATE1. My mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with. Then later she started and still is dating the guy we are renting awe house from. When my dad called and said that he was coming, @CAPS6 made me. So happy. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 didn't that @CAPS6 could make @CAPS6 @NUM4 months without seeing my dad.  @CAPS4 @CAPS6 did @CAPS6. Now that he's settled in a see him once a match for one weekend. With better than @NUM4 months or not at all.
3	15	12	About three or four times I was patience; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother when shopping for me I had to be patience and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I was up super early and ready to be to patience, once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I can open my presents. Then the  other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patince again so ,I waited till he got back. This will conclude my being patince paper .
1	15	16	Time when I was patient was at the doctor appointment I was standing there, calm quiet. When the doctor called, me I wasn’t nervous. So when the doctor gave me @NUM1 which, @CAPS1 didn’t have at. Then, me and my mom went home happy. Got some hwigese  and watch @CAPS2. Then , we had some spaghetti and went to had early for school. Then, I had a good day in school in the @NUM2 grade when I was in land.  Then, I went home, do my homework, clean up the house, watch. @CAPS2, eat dinner, then went to led has a early start
1	11	12	Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life.
1	23	24	There was a girl name @PERSON1. She loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend they would either @CAPS3 the movies, amusement or water park, or just stay home. This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about @CAPS1 was about @CAPS3 happen. Today was a @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed. Once they settled down, @PERSON1’s mom looked sad. “@CAPS1’s wrong mom?” @PERSON1 asked. “I have @CAPS3 go. I have @CAPS3 go somewhere for work and can’t take you with me,” mom replied. “@CAPS2 not?” asked @PERSON1. “I don’t know, but I need you @CAPS3 wait here with your father. I’ll be back soon,” the mom said calmly. With that @PERSON1’s mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there confused and wishing her mom didn’t have @CAPS3 go. Then she went @CAPS3 the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1’s dad came @CAPS3 her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. @PERSON1 went @CAPS3 her room and began  @CAPS3 wait patiently for her mom. Weeks past and @PERSON1’s mom still hasn’t returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though see never complained @CAPS3 her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom. Two years have passed since @PERSON1’s mom had left. @PERSON1 didn’t cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother @CAPS3 come back. One day @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other. They both cried and her mom whispered “I’m sorry.” @CAPS3 @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were unseperatable. They never left each other’s side again.
0	16	16	I was patient at the dentist office. When I went to the dentist office, I was getting my bracts put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire. While they were getting the brackets and wire I got to pick out colors. I waited about @NUM1 mins. Without complaining. Next, they started putting the brackets on the glue. When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and kido tasted like heated metal “@CAPS1” I said. After they had put on the brockets and then they put colors. My mouth hurt like crazy! When it was all over I noticed  it had been @NUM2 hours! I was surprised because I didn’t know I sat there for @NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time! That’s the time I was patient at the dentist office.
5	14	19	One day, my soccer team was in the chamionchip game in we facing the lions. At the start of the game I was on the bench I was the worst on my team. After the @DATE1 we were up @NUM1 but my coach still put me on the bench and I just sat there and cheered for my. The next to quarters went by and it was tie game @NUM2. Half way through the @DATE2 are star player got hurt so coach put me in. I had no due what do I was just chassing the ball. With one minute left I was standing by their goalie and one of my team mates shot the ball zinged through the air and hit me in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal my team started to cheer we were up @NUM3. After the @DATE2 minute was done and horned went off and every one cheered again and lifted me up. That’s how patience helped me.
1	14	15	Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can’t. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new “@NUM1” flat screen @CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he could’ve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just won’t. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into  tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont
2	17	15	One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I had to wate about @NUM1 hours to go on the top thrill dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were wating and wating. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I don’t want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a @NUM2 second ride it was the best thing that I had ever wated for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.
6	23	17	@CAPS5 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 loved playing various games with her younger brother @PERSON1 @CAPS2! One day when she was playing sorry with @PERSON1, sadly @PERSON1 was taking an unpleasable amount of time on his turn. @CAPS5 was getting extremely angry at @LOCATION1 for taking so long. So @CAPS5 started scream. As you can imagine when @CAPS5 and @PERSON1â€™s @CAPS8 @PERSON2 heard this she ran to @CAPS5 and @PERSON1. She questioned @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @CAPS5 â€œ@CAPS5 dear, what are screaming about? I sure hope your not screaming at @PERSON1!â€ â€œ@CAPS4 I was, but thatâ€™s only because @PERSON1 wonâ€™t hurry up!â€ @CAPS5 exclaimed. â€œ@CAPS4 @CAPS5 says sorry to @PERSON1 then for being so sour and not letting him take his time. Heâ€™s younger then you, which means he doesnâ€™t know any better.â€ @CAPS8, @PERSON2, exclaimed forcefully.â€  Iâ€™m so sorry @PERSON1!â€ @PERSON3 said with a tear trickling down her cheak. So they gave each others hugs, and went on patiently with their game of sorry.
0	24	24	Are you a patient person? Well I’m not! Well, I can be patient I just won’t like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since they’re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. it’s hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn’t want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is.
3	14	11	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah dad is a firefighter and he had to put out of fire a could not pick me up to the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned Patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time I had to live with it.
4	20	24	Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever.
2	16	14	One @CAPS1 I was patient of waiting for a game to arive. I waited @NUM1 years for it to come and the @CAPS1 finele came I started out the the @CAPS1 like it was eany other. @CAPS8 the @CAPS1 just kept @CAPS4 on so @CAPS5 the time I @CAPS6 @CAPS7 I just sat the froant porch the rest of the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 it never came so I just went to @CAPS9. The next @CAPS1 I came @CAPS7 I checked the mail @CAPS11 it was empty so I  slamped on to the coach and watched tv I looked out the front @CAPS12 and the was a packeg that was just @CAPS13  it was my game and that's the story of my patients.
0	24	24	Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, you’re time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman – @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didn’t even see it, truth be told I’m not even sure if it happen but you can’t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn’t took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn’t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didn’t a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite! Nobody‘s perfect, you’ll have to wait and see who will score the next point!
1	12	11	One time when I waited game but I couldn’t get yet .So I asked  my mom if can she buy me a new game, how much does it cause? @NUM1 dollars then she said you have to wait for some days the @NUM2 went by then I finally asked my mom can she buy for me she said well yet .I said thank you .Then the next morning we went to the game store, then I saw the game I wanted,I told my mom that we went to the counter and bought my game .
4	19	15	When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen.
2	22	24	RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didn’t care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they weren’t bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now we’re at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself “be patient.” @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most.
0	17	17	A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience.  My classmates and I were divided into groups at differents areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the differen characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it. Our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, “@CAPS1 @CAPS2!” as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!
0	13	13	Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. It’s one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting  their turn without complaining about it . Sometimes people don’t like being patient I know I don’t lik to a lot @CAPS1. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not ??? tuned others wait. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet don’t talk very much even when they do talk they ??? talking when people inturupt them. And they defiantly don’t yell as someone  out at all. It’s a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an ??? (part not legible) good family good friends and a ??? .So in conclusion that;s why it’s good to be patient.
0	24	24	Melted @CAPS1 One day @CAPS13 sister and I have just woke up one bright @DATE1 @TIME1. @CAPS5 was at @CAPS13 door. The light shinned through @CAPS13 cartains and @CAPS13 covers. @CAPS5 pushed the door open just a crack and said, “@CAPS2” “@CAPS3”, I got up moaning “@CAPS4 me up. I’m sleeping.” @CAPS5 helped me up and hugged me while I was searching, I went in to the living room. @CAPS5 were in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but @CAPS19 was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didn’t know @CAPS13 mom was on the coach. “@CAPS6, go put the clothes in the diver”, called ?? “@CAPS7.K.” I ??, “(@CAPS8 want to come down stairs to.” “@CAPS9” he exclaimed. “@CAPS10’ I thought in @CAPS13 head. We walked down stairs in the ??? to the laundry room when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” @CAPS5 look frightened and said “@CAPS9 I’m cooking something. “@CAPS13 eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened @CAPS19 and @CAPS14 pushed me out side hare coms. “@CAPS10 air!” we m joined. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards @CAPS17 still on the couch sleep. We shook her and shook her but @CAPS5 didn’t wake up, so I said “cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” “@CAPS16 wrong with ya’ll!” @CAPS17 yelled. “The @CAPS1, fire, @CAPS18 @CAPS19!” I screamed. @CAPS5 stood, we ran, @CAPS5 grabbed a cup of water and poured @CAPS19 on the @CAPS1. “I need to teach you how to cook better or until you won’t set any thing on fire!” I said.
2	11	13	Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient.
2	22	20	The time I was patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 ""mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go."" @CAPS2 mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beutiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2 and it was also @CAPS2 step dad's birthday. ""@CAPS3 you need to be patient okay, @CAPS4 have a long drive, do you have everything you need."" @CAPS5 got me there. I had to get, coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, ect…. I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @CAPS2 head, food thats what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""of @CAPS4 go."" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked @CAPS2 father."" @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally @CAPS2 step father yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tierd when I woke up, "" are @CAPS4 there yet, first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth ""yeah"" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause."" @CAPS13 take in some off the bags."" ""@CAPS14"" I said with a scowse on @CAPS2 face. ""@CAPS15 youhave to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of @CAPS2 dreams and the first thing I did was sleep.
3	15	12	The time I was patient was when I went @CAPS1 fishin with my step dad. I could not wait for long so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs. My step dad said you set ur pole down on a sling shot holder and do whatever. So I went walk around explore the world and I was think about how I can do patience. I was to go check on my pole and I got nothing so I feel in the coast out for way so I sat wait and wait but until that moment my pole start to jak around so I reel in caught a large @CAPS1 I was so happy. My step dad said see you do got patience.
3	23	20	Today was the final day of tryouts. The deciding day .Tryouts we over I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I didn’t know if could handle this. “@CAPS1 until you’ve left the building to open your envelope,” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS3’s only fair .If everyone opens them in here then people who don’t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn’t make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out .Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building.” she called my name .I came up and grabbed my envelope .She dismissed us .some girls opened their envelopes right away .But, they didn’t make @CAPS3 .karma .I waited until I got outside. I could barely @CAPS1 .I needed to know but I had to @CAPS1 .Patience isn’t such a lovely thing always. l opened my envelope. I made the team! I was so excited and I was glad I had the patience to @CAPS1 and be surprised.
1	17	16	A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip ,she moved slower than my grandpa you are probally asking yourself  hour does this make her patient ,@CAPS1 @CAPS2  had to follow her every where she went if @CAPS2 wasn’t patient I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in @CAPS2 mean @CAPS2 took here almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom . Normally I’m  not a patient person at all ,but when this  happened I had to be patient .I’m  glad @DATE1 that I was  patient because now I am more patient then I was before .My mom is proud  of my behavior ,because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed @CAPS2 .Being patient is a good thing, you look at life  different .now I can imagine me being patient.i mean I’m not glad my mum get hurt but I’m glad of my consequence of the problem .After the big accident hapend I have learned  that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me that is one example about how I thought of  I small were here away ever  been patience ,without my mom.
1	18	19	Are you good with being patient? Sometimes I am but sometimes @CAPS1 not @CAPS2 going to tell you a story when I was patient when @CAPS1 normally not patient in situations like this. I had want to school with my mom so she can take a test @CAPS4 drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting I was texting and on the internet, @CAPS4 my stomach started to rumble, I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I can get something to eat as I was texting I stopped and thought about what was I about to do. I knew @CAPS5 hard long she had studied for that test. I didn`t want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there. I texted people. People called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test she came out the room. I asked her “@CAPS5 did it go?” she looked at me smiled and said “I felt confident, but know @CAPS1 hungry I shouted out “me to” we got in the car and went to subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cooking, chips, and a drink it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @CAPS4 we went @ORGANIZATION1, charlete, @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and others places as well. After I thought about it I never want to do that again. I was starting and my but started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do never again will I do that. At least I had bounding rime with my mom. That’s one bright side.
5	17	22	I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.
1	16	17	This is a story when I was patient. I believed in aIeons. So I went in a field and sat and waited for them. I was about @NUM1 years old. So I thot to go out there, I am out there waiting and waiting. Then I saw something, my gosh its just a shotting star. I was so existed but is wasen’t one. All of a sudden I saw a deer and it was running rite after me. So I shot it. Then I was waiting I was waiting. I was bored so I made up a song. I am waiting for the aIeons yes I am waiting yes I am. When it got dark out I saw something. It was the aIcons. the space craft stop in the field. The aIeons walk out and shot all of them. Then took them home and showed them to the hole town. They didnt believe me the I told them to go to the field and look at the space craft and they all fainted. Thats a  time I was patient.
4	11	7	Patience perso is someone that deal with difficulties without complaining. Like when your waiting in the docters office fora checkup. Or in the eye doctors maybe a dentist. When your in the doctors office it all quiet then there a phone ringing! Then the doctor walks in or dentist all there is is waiting and waiting.
1	19	20	“@CAPS1” @CAPS2 my teacher said “@CAPS3 we are starting the meap test!” “uhhh” the @CAPS2 sighed exactly at the same time. After teache passed out our booklets we filled in information, wrote our names and begain. As the test dragged on I @CAPS4 @CAPS5 finished! But there were slow workers who were very slow. I was bored! Nothing to do but sit down. I wanted to complain but I decided not to for the sake of my @CAPS2, finally part @NUM1 was finished. “Time for part @NUM2 @CAPS2!” exlamed teacher. “oh you’ve got to be kidding me I said to myself. Part @NUM2 was short, but it took one kid @NUM4 mins! At the end of the day teacher was very proud of me for being patient. Later that year my meap results came in and they were fantastic!
2	19	17	One time when I was patient was when I was in the end of the year in fourth grade and I’d just signed up for football. I had @DATE1 wait from @DATE1. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. @DATE1 passed by and it was @DATE2. In @DATE2 I show cows so that made @DATE2 zip by really fast. Finally it was @DATE1. I only had @DATE1 wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came fast. Then it was time @DATE1 go. I liked football that year and I have did football ever since.It took patience @DATE1 wait for football. Two months @MONTH1 not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard @DATE1 wait that long.
1	13	12	One time when I was patient I got a @ORGANIZATION1 last @CAPS1 I asked for a @ORGANIZATION1 and my @CAPS2 said maybe. So I waited all year I knew I would get one but I kept waiting and you know what I got a blue @ORGANIZATION1 and on top of that @NUM1 new goues with it. But over the time I wated I was going nuts knowing I was gonna get the @ORGANIZATION1. But when I finally got it I was glad I was patient the wait was wen worth it especially because I relly waited my @ORGANIZATION1.
4	18	14	A time I was patient was waiting @NUM1 to @NUM2 whole months for my baby brother, @PERSON1 who is @NUM3 now. @CAPS1 felt like @NUM2,000 years’ @CAPS1 was ??? long I couldn’t wait but I had to use patience to wait. He was due on @DATE2, but instead he was out on @DATE1. When I came to the ????. Finally at @NUM5 am on @DATE1 my brother @PERSON1 was finally born ??? @NUM2 long months. The ??? a time I used ???
3	16	13	One time my friend @PERSON1 was at my house and we were playing halo. We were having a very good time. We ate popcorn, drank alot of pop and ate alot of candy. Then @PERSON1 had to go to the bathroom. He was there for a wile and suddenly I had  to go the bathroom. Iwaited and waited and had to go very bad. I was very polite and  patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry up, I did ask him once if was ok and said yes after that I just waited, then he came out and @CAPS1 a very big realife
2	14	16	That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game.
0	12	12	One day I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a very long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patient cause we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours when that time past we all went to get our spots and before we had did that there was this long line again but even longer but it was ok cause I had patients. With all this patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in his waiting room. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept on interrupting her and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone so she ran up the stair and she said your stupid punk so I said I don’t care.
0	7	7	It’s like when your wating in line thats patience. Or like when you kep on rasing your hand the techer kep on saying do your work and you does l it a gen she will say, if you do that agen you will go to the chouse room. Thats when a teacher loses her patience.
3	18	15	One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said “are mom and dad”. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reason’s why I had to be patient on are @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town.
5	21	16	This is the time when I was patient. One @DATE1 day I was playing with my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said ""@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient"" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine she got that to. So I just keep waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, ""dad can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?"" ""@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""ugh okay!"" I hollered to the next day my dad had already gotten what my brothe and sister wanted, and I was the only one who my dad and mom that never gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard just takes patience. Thats how patience helps you ecomplish what you want.
2	16	14	Over the @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @CAPS1.  @CAPS2 got up early and drove to @LOCATION4 I was the firts time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patients or else the ride was going to be boring me and my sister got on the plane and flew to @LOCATION3 and it took @NUM1 minutes and that was easy but then @CAPS2 got on another plane and went directly to @PERSON1 and that took @NUM2 hours I was a very long ride but I had patient, but my sister didn't have any patients at all the whole ride she was asking which @CAPS2 were going to get there. And that was the time, I had patients.
5	14	9	A time when I was patient was on the city bus. So me and my mom could go to walmart. We waited for @NUM1 hours till we got there. Before we got on we had to pay a @MONEY1 each. Then ask for transfer very nicely. T hen hop on another bus then get off and go shopping. Then wait till bus comes back and go home after @NUM1 hours. Then get of bus at the corner and walk back to the house.
2	22	24	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day.
1	8	7	Patience is the way to being a only ??????? patience is waiting a while for something,as ??? IF you wait a long time without getting mad on reading out, you are what people all patient. If your kept up this habbit, your will have a good life that ????
1	12	13	I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to fuzzys and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seemed like took forever. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I did’t eat nothing. There was me my mom and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tries to. Some people have patient and other don’t. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients.
0	16	16	A Time I was patient was the time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I whent to the @CAPS3 @NUM1 hours early. @CAPS7 we walk up to the front desk panting from ruming because we thought we were late and the @ORGANIZATION2 said ""Are you ok!"" I said ""@CAPS4, am I late for the appointment for foyce""! Wo your @NUM1 hours early "" she said"" @CAPS2 you pulled me. Out @CAPS1 two favorite hours in school to be @NUM1 hours early""! I said ""sorry would you like me to take you back to school"" ""@CAPS6 I'm good "".I said @CAPS7 we waited in the loby and I was fine with it because I had the???west as game @ORGANIZATION1 ball @CAPS8 than chichi @NUM4 for @CAPS9.S! I just played that until I got bored of it then I read some wired adult magazine. By the easy I was only @NUM5 when this happened and now I'm almost @NUM6. Then the @CAPS3 walked out and I got @CAPS1 shots. That was the time I was patient the most ant longest
1	13	14	@NUM1. Last, year I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. So after I came home from school I left right back out. When we got there we had to wait in the lobby. There were crying babys every where, we still had to go to the movies, and shopping. @NUM2. There were still to many people in front of me. I started to get mad. Finally, they called my            name. I was so happy I didnâ€™t know what to do.
4	17	13	When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a spacific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talking for long time, but my grandma said if I wasn’t patient I wouldn’t get my new phone that day. We make it up to the counter and he’s showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!
5	17	12	I chose write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting, I was only hunting squirls but still. What I had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. So I was sitting very still for @NUM1 minutes and finally I seen a squirl. So I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirl. So that’s my story on patients.
7	18	11	@NUM1 years ago on my birthday the only thing I wanted was an I-pad touch. Well everybody got to the party we ate cake and ice cream then I opend presants. I got @NUM2 but none was the @CAPS1 toach. I was sad then I opend birthday cards and I got @MONEY1 I told mom since I didnâ€™t get the @CAPS1 I can go buy it. But I had too wait till everybody was gone to go get it. and @NUM3 hours of being patient I finally went and got it.
2	17	19	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end.
1	23	22	A time when iwas patient was a last @DATE1. My friend, @CAPS1, took me to cedar point in @LOCATION1. The place was so packed, it took five minuites to get from the car to the entrance. As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on  was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we weren’t even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks people’s seats said “go!” and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient
0	15	15	Patience! Being patient can get you want and I gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It @DATE1; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didn’t get it. I waited another week I still didn’t get it. When my birthday came, (@DATE2) I finally got my matai scoot! I was so happy! That’s why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!
9	13	22	Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient.
3	12	9	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should’nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.
6	11	17	A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed schoo) while waiting I did plenty of things. I played my xbox @NUM1 and I got on the computer. But while xbox I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in @CAPS1. Moures @CAPS2. After he got online we played most of day then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn’t work. After that I tried to play my xbox but after another hour (nowaround @TIME1) it got bored. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online. We played all day till night
0	18	18	A time I was patience was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide. The biggest water slide there. It had the longest line cher, it made a swerl and my family was at the end of the swerl. I was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the leaver water slide. It was huge just about @NUM1 feettall. And we got in line and only an half an hour had gone by when my mom let it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my my other brother my sister, and my dad is left in line. When some one got hurt on the ride and the shut it down for two hours. Finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad get scard end left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. The old man met his pance and l was so happy to finally get on.
0	19	19	Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to resturaunts when we wait for our food I get board very easially. On time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot.@CAPS1 my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said “I don’t think there is anything wrong, but we won’t be sure.” @CAPS1 she sent my mom and me to the urgent case out on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty five minutes car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in we waiting in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patient because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle.
1	16	15	One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were writing in line to put school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 out and we had to stand there. It was so long the new battery I had just put in my @NUM3 went dead. It took areand @NUM4 hours just to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barly got our things that day, but because we were patient, we did.
1	13	12	Do you have a mother who is bisy all the time. If not i do. For some reason I like travel every where with her. One day we went to a place that I forgot the name of. I was so patient. Being patient is kind of hard because, you really dont have nothing to do. @CAPS1 took her like @NUM1. I was happy when we left but I wasnt say things like, come on, hurry up, @CAPS1’s taking to long, @CAPS2 hungry, @CAPS2 ready to leave and things like that.
5	19	14	In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.
4	11	7	Being patience is hard to do, @CAPS1 I do remember a time when I was patient. This was at @CITY1. Me and my group had to wait for everyone to get back to the bus. We were the first one’s to the bus so it took a while before they came. @CAPS1 before they did I was as calm and patient as can be.
2	14	16	I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it wast the first week of football. We went town to subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!
3	19	16	There was this day not to long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but wait. It was at basketball tryouts when we were finding out if we made the team. I had to wait, and wonder if I made it. I thought to myself… I wonder I wonder if I pushed enough I wonder if I messed up to much.” @CAPS1 I could think about were the mistakes I made so that day @TIME1 that I had been sitting down waiting to here my name… I had my name! “ @PERSON1 number @NUM1 tryouts please come get your paper.” I got it, took it outside, opened it, and read. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 you had made the goled team.” I jumped up and down. That day I had my patients, and there  for. I made the team.

Twice as much people were lined up. “@CAPS4 least there wont be as much people on the other rides, I said @NUM3 was very paitent to go on the ride, even though it lost @NUM5 hours
2	12	10	I’m writing a story about patience. Patience in can say like I’m waiting for you to get done with whatever your doing. Something like the o, say @CAPS1 been waiting for the kids to be quite. And they can’t so even though she’s getting mad, she still being patient with us instead of saying get out my class giving us chance after chance. Because she want us to be good and stay in class.
0	20	20	The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. @CAPS5 were loading up for a three-hour drive to the @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if @CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until @CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" @CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as @CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least @CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother @CAPS3's still like that now.
4	12	16	It was one @DATE1 morning in wisconson last day of deer hunting. I got up and dressed me my dad and friend where all sitting down to eat we had pankacs and milk. Out side it was about @NUM1 so we buttered up and  and headed at. I was kind of scary in the worst at night because we don't know whats out there or whos out there. but after we got in. He stand all my ways went away. After @NUM2 hours in the stand my dad tells me ""@CAPS1 time to get back and eat"" not right now"" l said ""@CAPS1"" said my dad then l guess I'll see you latter so after he came back it wa right around @NUM3 when out of the bruch came the buck l was wating for. So l bought my gun up and shot he went right down. I have never been  so proud in my life The @CAPS3.
4	20	16	??? One time when I was being very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn’t get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said that’s ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma and that we were going to spend the night in a hotel I so we would be even closer to @CAPS1 adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our??? ??? and @NUM2 extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to @CAPS1 adventure that next morning. Even though we were suppose to go
0	21	21	One day in the beginning of foll, @PERSON1 was watching @CAPS1.V. As she was watching, a commercial comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day of school, everyone was excited. They all couldn’@CAPS1 wait to see the movie that night. Finally the time come to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line was already formed. @PERSON1  was waiting, then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up her lime. Her name was @CAPS2. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn’@CAPS1 get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient.
1	18	17	One time I was patient when @PERSON1 @CAPS1 would not work every body sat down and was quet. It took up the hole hour there was a little, chitt chatt her and there but mostly every body was quiet for her while a capo of sudents helped her. We going to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2, but when she tryed to play the movie, it wouldn’t come on you could hear it but couldn’t see it, the at the end of the hour you could see it but you couldn’t hear it, “but it worked for all the other the classes” @PERSON1 said the next day she gave us fruits snacks for being so patient and she got the movie to work first it was in just gray and white the she jiggled a card then it showed color but the day that I was patient was the @NUM2 time. I was patient with a teacher she was proud of me and I was proud of myself I can’t believe what I did for @PERSON1 then it happend again this time she let every body just chill in our chair and talk with our friend but I just watten her fix her @CAPS1 but the next day she didn’t give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends’. That was a time when my classmates and I were patient.
1	15	14	I don’t have much patience, but I’ll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was @DATE1 after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasn’t. My mom said “@CAPS2 hes not here in two minutes we have to go with out him”. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads “@CAPS1, we had to go with out you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-@CAPS4”. But when I was signing the note he pulled up. That was the story when I had patients.
6	23	17	I was patiEnt wen I saw a huge bass jump out from at my cottage. I waited and ate break fast and then went fishing. My little brother wanted to go fishing too. So I was patient enough to wait for him to get a new bait tie it and come out. So we get out front and he catchs a small bass so I unhooked it and brought him over to show mum and dad wat he had caught but little did I realize that a huge @NUM1 pound bass was rooming around out there. So as soon as I got out there first cast @CAPS1! A huge bass take my bate. At first I thought I caught a carp. but wen I saw that @NUM1 pound bass jumip with my bait in its mouth I shaking with exeitment! When I showed that fish to my dad he about fainted and the same with me, my mom and my little brother cody. And right now that fish is at the tax adermy.

3	19	16	When I was about seven And my mom was pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said “she coming” my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day.
2	15	17	I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at ceder point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the rapter that took one hour just to get on the ride but when we got on it felt like it was even longer then the wait in line it felt like @NUM1 hours because of how ??? it was. We walked and saw the ??? force it had a ??? ??? on it so we waited in line was much longer than the rapter it was like 3-@NUM1 hours. But when we got to the hop of the stairs we were up it was so much fun because we waited so long and my brother stopped complen because he was so ??? in me. the ride was fun but when we were done we had to leave ??? was like mom. We only wait on the rides but it was fun and ??? That was a time when I was patient.
1	12	11	d time I was patient was when we where going to disocy w orkerd for the first time and l was very excited ! We only bad one week left to wait to go .But I couldn’t wait that long l thought l waited long enough to, and I wanted to go at moment.  Even thought I had to wait still bad a fon time a disrey word I juss had to be patient!
1	17	16	I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while.
4	10	14	There are some ?? ??? in ??? ??? you ??? ??? to second and one of those thing is a patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate and when you experience thing that not ??? complain that when patience is.You have to have patience if you planning on having kids or being  I cather or any other job you have to wait in ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???.Those are a just a couple reason why ??? patience.The final reason that am going to say you need patience is because in life everything  is not just ??? to you.You have to work for it and to that you have to have patience.So no matter what if you don’t have patience you will have  a really hard time getting through life.So thse are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience.So if you don’t have patience learn to be patient.I believe that you can do it all you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and don’t complain about ??? that hard in life there is going to be a lot of hard things in life.Theres only one more thing I have to say and that is just try.
1	4	5	I was patient when I was at the @CAPS1.R whe I broke my finger A week ago almost.
1	23	24	Patient is a great thing. It means to be understanding and calm. Sometimes people can take difficulties and pain and still stay calm. Any time when your brother or sister annoys you your still patient and never little back. “@CAPS1! “@CAPS2 up already!! “@CAPS3 my brother.” @CAPS4 I ‘m awake! “I hollered. I took in a huge gulp of air and let it out with a sigh. “I ‘m soo bred!” my brother shouted in my face, “can we @CAPS13 walking “I was counting past ten in my mind and then finally spoke “@CAPS7”. I got my coat off the rack followed by little brother. We walked outside right when we saw my mom coming to give meachore. “You’ll have to cut the grass to day and rake the leaves.” @CAPS5 said calmly,” @CAPS6 you walk your little brother “.  “@CAPS7”, I was completely furious @CAPS12 the inside. I tried to keep calm, but the that didn’t last long, “@CAPS8 @CAPS9!” my brothers friend said cheer fully, “can you come over and play?”@CAPS10 asked him my brother looked up at me and I was closing my eyes breaking wont out. “I stammered walking back home. I grabbed the learn mower and right when I was about to turn it @CAPS12 –“@CAPS11, get inside and start your home work. . . Then, you can not the down!”  “ One two. . There … “I counted silently. I walked with a fake grin @CAPS12 my face.” @CAPS12 the other hand … @CAPS13 take out the trash!”  “One hundred seventy-five…! Kept counting. I ran down stair grabbed the trash and walked to the trash can as I dropped the garb age inside I tried to put my self in a happy place – @CAPS1! I sped inside to gaze at @CAPS24 had happened, it turnout my sister broke my x box @CAPS12 the tites because @CAPS5 wanted to play. If get passed @NUM1 in counting in my brain I ‘m going to @CAPS15! I thought. I held my little sister and gave her to my mom.” @CAPS5 broke my x box! “I repeated “@CAPS17 @CAPS7, your dat will fix it . “@CAPS5 said calmly “@CAPS19 @CAPS13 get your brother,”  “@CAPS4 … “I speed walked down to my brothers’ friend house and told him I had to get my brother. “@CAPS7”…  @CAPS22! @CAPS10 shouted “your brother is here to get you.” “@CAPS23!” I urged to stay silent and patient and I managed to. We walked back home and I threw my self @CAPS12 my bed. “@CAPS24 a borins day! “I spoke to myself. “I don’t think I ‘m ever going to be this patient in my life again!! And I smacked my head @CAPS12 the pillow and said “@CAPS25 @CAPS26! “and went to bed. Wow! @CAPS24 a day! Patience means to be understanding and calm. Patience great. I tried and learned a powerful lesson, always try. My life is way better @CAPS19 I bays try to stay patient and never hit my brother or sister even though they get me @NUM2 mad sometimes. The @CAPS26 would be better if everyone would just stay patient, people have to try to checeed, it’s a very very famous phrase.
1	16	15	Patience, it’s something that my family doesn’t have. Here is the story. Wile am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister @PERSON2 hit him. So sence @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone. He is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon. And what do you know he does. Okay you think it’s going to get better? Nope wrong. I get @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 just won’t so l call @PERSON2 in here and @CAPS1 got to hit her then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying now @PERSON2 is being a brat stomping of the stairs. When ??? got ??? calm down. Now just as l am about to go crazy @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes  @CAPS1 down stairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @CAPS3 back down. What a day well l guess my family does have patience well not my step dad.
0	9	9	Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans.  Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn’t pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine.
6	11	17	One time I was pacient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. I had to baby sit my cousin @CAPS2 while his room pack up cause they were making back to @LOCATION2. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way. But I was pacient  and waited til the trip was away. I didn’t complain til  I got home til  my mom. Me and my cousin got in lots of fights on that vacation. But I still love him . I had to be very pacient with my cousin and even maybe do what he wanted but I knew his mom was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then @CAPS2 wanted to go to the pack.I knew I had to give in ( considering that hes @NUM1 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the pack. That was a time that I had to be pacient.
2	16	18	One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my slurpee and inline to buy my slurpee. then an old lady got in line. So to be nice I let her in front of me. @CAPS1 a while she found out that she was a dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me said thanks and gave me a mint @CAPS1 I bought my slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat their for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house my friend hold to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market. he told us he got lost. We walked home and on that day, I learned that it’s tough to be patient.
2	15	17	One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher my class a leaf project. We had to collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf you will have to put the leaves in newspaper then put books on the newspaper so the water will come out of the leaves on to the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you half to do this a couple times for each leaf. I had to be patient because the first due date was coming up, but mom said to form my project in the next due date. So since I was patient, my project got done before the second due date and got @NUM2 extra points. So when your patient you can get rewarded
4	16	20	When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she I had to wait until @CAPS1. That got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchsreen with a key board. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone. Also a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it it was only a week until @CAPS1 so I was excited, even though I had to pay for phone bill. I just wished the time would fly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was wait. After six day past, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating of excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom. So being patient will eventually pay off.
0	19	19	A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun  time in @LOCATION1!
3	15	12	One time I was on my way to the bus stop, and I had got their @NUM1 minutes before the bus came so I sat their and I looked at my watch it was @NUM2 minutes past the time I was support to get picked up so I waited and waited so I boked at my watch again it was @NUM3 minutes pass the time I was support to be on the bus. So I was growing in nation but I had thought well buses are???  I sat back down and I wanted because I????was going to ??? and I grew very patient and after @NUM4 more minutes the bus had came, and it had let me on free because I was the only person who  stayed at the stop? So when I got back home my mom asked me how did it in gow I said the bus was late @NUM5 minutes  she said what did you do I said I waited and they let me on free she said that is what you get for being patient.
1	12	11	I was patinent when we were on the bus, we had just arrived at school the kids were loud and nociy in the day. Were a lot to get off the bus when someone jumped in front of ??? then I fell back into my seat, the was about @NUM1 - @DATE1 kids getting off the bus. So I waited for all the kids to pass me then I got up and walked down the  alie to the door, then the bus driver said"" thanks for waiting"". Then I left
0	24	24	“@CAPS1! Look out!” @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulences’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, hunny!” my mother teared up as @CAPS6. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.
7	17	24	Patience? I am not a patient type of person. I am a @PERSON1 @CAPS1. He played in a @CAPS11 called @CAPS2 which l really wanted to @CAPS10. Which came out @DATE1. That l havent even seen yet until One day l was sitting in my porch where l asked my mom to @CAPS19 to @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS2 that @DATE2 when she said ""wlc"" l was really upset because l wanted to @CAPS10 it really really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my @CAPS4's, @CAPS5's, sister's and brother's to fave me. @CAPS14 they said they were busy so l cried myself to sleep. The next @NUM1 days my mom and dad was talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling ""@CAPS6 ARE @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 AND @CAPS10 A @CAPS11 AND @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS7 @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS9 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 OWN @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 I left out the room. The very next day my brother and his girlfriend went to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 it knowing l wanted to @CAPS9. They came home reasing me saying @CAPS6 good the @CAPS11 was. So that night l went down stairs to demand to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 ""@CAPS2"" saying "" I am being very patient with you all about taking me to @CAPS10 @CAPS2 @CAPS14 you all are pushing my buttons so l demand to @CAPS9 tomarrow"" @CAPS22 I waited @NUM2 second @CAPS22 she said that l could @CAPS9 this @DATE2. That was the very @NUM3 time that l was patient, and I'm proud of myself, I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 wait to @CAPS10 my @CAPS25 @PERSON1 @CAPS26
4	19	15	Being patient means that when your in a bad situation you don’t complain. Some people aren’t vary patient and some are very patient. In my eyes patience is very important, I likes to think of myself of sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privillage to go when you want get taken away then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself be patient we’ll stop at the next place. Another thing was you were alway hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times that was not fun. Also whenever you got food was not enough. But I did’nt complain. Lastly you just really want to get there you couldn’t wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience. When we finally got there I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience and I pasted, and actually it wasn’t nearly as bad as the trip back.
2	13	15	The first time I learned patience was when I was I my mom said she would by me a play @NUM1 I wanted it so bad but in, had to wanit to get it so I did and I waited and waited and waited then if figured it’s a whole month that and nothing happend I just was so mad but I didn’t do anything so we went to wal mart and she bought me a play @NUM1. I was in happy. Later I asked for an xbox (stirl seven) my mom said wait I waited for @NUM3 months but still nothing. @NUM4 months nothing, @NUM5 months nothing, I was just so angry but a whole year passed I got @NUM6. I was awsome I got my own room and @CAPS1. I got an xbox @NUM7 to being older is awesome.
4	20	16	Today was the first day I was patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again.
4	20	16	I was patient when my mom was giving  birth to my baby brother. We had to sit in the waiting room. My sister and I for @NUM1 hours I slept @NUM2 times and a lot because my dad was hungry so he got @CAPS1 food also.The first hour I was excited and couldn’t wait. The second hour I was coloring with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to @CAPS1.The third hour I watched tv. The fourth hour I slept till about @TIME1 that’s what my sister said. My dad came out with plastic looking dress on with the matching head/shower cover and slippers, and  he said “ the next time he comes out my sister and  I were gonna be sister to a baby boy .” @CAPS1 and sister were so happy. So an hour later my dad came out and said “ do you want to see @PERSON1 ,” @CAPS1 and my sister screamed “ yes “ When we seen him we were so happy to think he was all ours .
5	10	15	This was one day when I had to do something that I didn’t want to do and if I didn’t do it I couldn’t go no were or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt house an I had to clean up her house an I didn’t want to do it so she had told me that her house should be clean when she come back home an I was the only one there. When I went to @CAPS1 point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride an you have  to take your shoes of than we got something to eat. The next day when everybody wolk up we heat from the hotel and went home an ate breakfast an than I didn’t won’t to ride my uncle four wheeler down the hill but he had started it up an push it but I had on knee pads and elbow pads and gloves. When I got to my grandma house.

Wow a was watching the football game out the window the other childs run out the door an I was not done with the wall
6	9	15	When I was around the age @NUM1. I went to @CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, and mom, and dad for a family reunen, we stoped so menny times I cant even count. I think it was to but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but the dad post was we hade to leave are dog home for a week, was in patient to get home to because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave from are house at @TIME1 and we got to the motel at @TIME2 am the after noon I was sick of sitting in the car I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it that is long ways to white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could of gotten there in a half of a hour or a have would have been a lot better than like, @NUM2 hours of time but it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen befor on your way there because on are way home. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient I was so board that every stop I would switch cars and I did not have tating at that time but I did have my @CAPS2 until it died then I made my I pod and my cells all I could do was call and play games on that but I was so impatient at the coner to cuzz I rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there lission to older people talk bout what has happened. I don’t know hardly any of them I could not tell you who every one was.
1	18	19	When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me.
0	20	20	Someone l know that is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people l know. Especially on this certain day. Every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle. We where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me… she pinched me. Then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. I know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why l think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave.
1	17	18	“@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!” @PERSON2 said, “I wanna go first!” @CAPS2 the time in cheerleading this girl named @PERSON2 thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah my name is @PERSON3. I’m always a fiuter along with @PERSON2. I’m always patient and wait my turn because I dont wanna complain or be a poor spot. “@CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6” the two bases and backspots yell. They pop @CAPS4 out and up thenscream “@CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job.” @CAPS7 says. “@CAPS8, it’s my turn, @PERSON3, you can do this your better then her.” I thought to myself “@CAPS9 we can do this. “One of are bases @PERSON1 said. I get @CAPS3. Hand on shoulders @CAPS3 to get poped up into the air. Are other base @CAPS10 says “@NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3,@NUM4,@NUM5,@NUM6- @CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job @CAPS12!” @CAPS13 cheers but loss. “I was so excited, “I just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5.” I thought with excitement. Being patient might be @CAPS6 after @CAPS2. From that day on I’ve always be patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on.
1	20	19	Patients is everything, ever hear these words! When you waiting in line for a test food restaurant, or when you stuck in a traffic. You’re annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. “patient is everything,” one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didn’t blame him, wich all those choices, he didn’t know what to pick, the lost of the line wasn’t as patient, “harry up.” One said “come on.” @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasn’t really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed

3	14	11	I was patient when I had a doctors ipointment. Me and my mom had ben waiting almost an hr for them to call me. Twenty minitues later the nures calls me. She says sorry for your wait. Thank you for being patient. Then after that my mom took me to get something to eat so we were waiting @NUM1 minitus later the gives us are food from the drive through. Sorry thanks for being patient.
1	17	18	You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “@CAPS2, don’t do it again.” @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have.
3	14	11	What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient. Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want think of other people, understand why it might have longer then you want and be patient.
1	10	9	I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. Soon I will once again have patience when I tutor for @CAPS1. To me patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have.
2	10	12	Pacience is a talent that is difficult to master. Pacience is a mental game. Pacience comes in everyones life. If you have no pacience then therefore you have more anger. Pacience for those minors stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a seal of years. Pacience is required there also. Pacience is among people everywhere whether it’s waiting for a toy or waiting for god  to save your pacience is something that will stay here forever.
4	24	20	Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me.
2	24	22	When I was @NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my @CAPS3 “can we go to get pizza?” @CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, “if you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza”. I didn’t want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. @CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” I asked. “Were done with the house @CAPS1 the car has yet to be washed” she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, “Are you done?” I asked rudely. “You could help if you want it to faster” @CAPS3 answers. “@CAPS4, fine I’ll help”, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, “lets do!” @CAPS5 the whole day I waitd @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish @CAPS1 in the end I finished the job.
1	17	16	Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremly happy. I would always backtrack of my days so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt.  @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude  ??? I was patient.
1	19	20	When I hurt my hand on the same day of meaping, I was patient, I was patient. I fell in the hall and I went to the office, I waited patietly for them to call my mom. to pick me up. When my mom she said she was going to take me to the @CAPS1 room. It took a wile to find a parking spot when we got there, I was patient even though hand hurting. The we finally found one and then went inside. My mom went to the font desk to tell them I was there. We waited to a little while and then a nurse came out and use go in a room and talk, she said I would have to wait for a bed to open up for x-rays. I saw a lady through the window I knew it was for me, she opened the doors and asked for @PERSON1. She had us follow her to a room where we waited about forty five minutes for a doctor to come in and take us to the x-ray room. When they finished we went back to the room and waited a wile. Antill the doctor come in and said I didn't broke anything, he gave me a brace and I went home, @CAPS2 all of that I was patient.
4	18	14	One some day, it was about @NUM1. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready I don’t know what we was getting ready far, but we get on the road as soon as we cloud. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height. I woke up from a big @CAPS1 on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars,” where are we?”I ask “six flags.” @CAPS2 my brother. I could hear impatience people all around me. They were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seem like we were moving faster than @CAPS3 of the fast people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the @CAPS3 impatience group of people I’d ever seen.
4	15	19	A time I was patient was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2. I was sitting doing my meap test when my stomach started to hurt. For about @NUM3 minutes I sat there moving around. Then I raised my hand to ask call my mom. When I called on me I asked her and @CAPS3 said “ @CAPS1.S @PERSON1 can you take ??? to the office.” And @PERSON1 said ok. Then me and @PERSON1 went to the office and I called my house phone my sister picked up the phone I said to her “@CAPS2 me speak to mama.” @CAPS3 said “hold up. Then my mom said “it do.” I said mama can you please come pick me up my stomach hurts reel bad.” @CAPS3 said “ok” and hung up I waited about @NUM3 minutes sitting the patient, tosing and turning from my stomach hurting so bad. Then finally called agian “I said moma is you coming“ @CAPS3 said “@CAPS4 on my way”. I said “ok” and hung up. I was sitting there patient and in pain till finaly my mom walked through the school doors and signed me out the @CAPS3 said “come on” my sister and ??? were sitting out in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat. I was sleep the whole way home then I woken up when we got there I went in the house layed on the couch and fell asleep.
3	16	19	This is a time I was patient. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 on my birth day, we had @NUM1 boys at my house. We all wanted to play xbox. (@ORGANIZATION1.core @NUM2). Only have @NUM3 controllers. So you now the rule let your geus’s no post! They all played ??. @NUM4 minutes! I had to ?? minutes to play my own game! @MONTH1 all my ?? lucky I was patient. I  hated sitting there it got me mad plus after a while they didn’t ?? play.so I asked my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 if they would play ?? with me. They said yes so after waiting @NUM5 minutes and then nobody wanted to play anymore. It made me feel pretty doing bad! It was my birthday you cant play a little ??. I felt good I stayed patient and didn’t go bisunck. This is a time I stayed patient.
1	18	17	Yo! I’m the narrator… you know the dude that tells the story, well I’m gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!
1	17	18	It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and we were up @ORGANIZATION1. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubeing. We vent cared out to the boat and go all ready to go, we tried to start the boat but there was nothing. My @CAPS1 and cousin took the back of the seats off and peared in the back, there was boat-roads of water the birage pump had stopped working. My step-dad took a look at them and said that it was going to be re-wired. He had soon re-wired the boat and it sill hadn’t worked all the kide were now getting antsy. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody had now calmed down and walked away. Pretty soon we heard a boat start up that sounded like my @CAPS1’s we ran down there with excitement and sure enough it was started we hoped in and there we went tubing down the river. Later that day my mom had said to me “patince is a virtue.”
0	14	14	My mom was patient when she was in line for her drivers licence it took three hours to get her drivers licence. She was angry but she was patient. And the lady that would give the drivers licence took a break when she came back my mom waited another three hours an she still was patient I was there too and I was patient but I wanted to yell at the lady for taking a break and making us wait for her for one extra hour. And another time my mom waited in line under the rum it was burning the only thing she did to cool down was drink for about two hours under eithy one degrees an she was still patient.
0	24	24	I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she’s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they’re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I’d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. It’s too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1, that’s not nice, please stop.” @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:” I realized tothem that’s like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn’t believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!
1	14	15	Patience is a very diffult thing @CAPS1 some people. One time I was at a huge party. But none of my friends or cousins were there. I was board the whole time. I asked my mom if we can go home she said ""no"". Then I sat down I waited and waited @CAPS1 a really long time. Then finally we went home. The next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house @CAPS1 a sleep over. This was because I was being patient at the party. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You recieve good when you be patient.
2	15	13	This one time my brother and I were coming back from @LOCATION1. Everything was fine until the car broke down on the free way. So we called our parents to come get us. Well when they got there they forgot the cabols. So just as they were getting to us they left. So @NUM1 hours went by hear they come. I said did you remember to get every thing. They shook their head yes hooked up the car and a way we went.
1	17	16	@PERSON2 and I went to the slove. @CAPS1 was picking up some marsh mellows and chocolate to make someone. @CAPS1 was walking??? Ial six when @CAPS1 came upon a huge bunch of people looking to bye stuff for smiles. So @PERSON2 and I went in the line. @CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marsh mellows and chocolate; but @CAPS1 came out with two â€“mash mellows and two chocolate packs. I asked her â€œ@PERSON2 why do you have two!â€ @CAPS1 said that when I waited they were getting rid of them so they gave me two to the same of one. I smiled and we??? Thank you! When we went back to the car we told @CAPS2 other sister â€œ@PERSON1â€ that we get two @NUM1 said???â€ @CAPS2 sister snicked we went back into @PERSON2â€™s car and but the bag in the trunk were one other???cryâ€™s were and then toke off. We got home and @PERSON1 ate three, I ate, two and @PERSON2 ate five @CAPS1??? us. Thank you.
1	12	11	You got try to be patient with homework. One time when I was doing my homework I started to be inpatient. Because I was having trouble. But then my dad said he was going to help me @CAPS1 he told me to be patient. @CAPS1 I sat there and sat. And stayed patient as l long as I could then he finely helped me. I usaly get unpatient when it comes to homework or something like that. You @CAPS2 need to try your hardest to be patient.
0	21	21	A while ago when I went on a trip to cedar point in @LOCATION1, it was an hour and thirty @DATE1 drive to go there, the reason why we went was because of my dad work @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I kept out of the car with??? @NUM1, wait for my suaisn  family, waiting  was all I did until @DATE1 were burst out running into the parky my dad points out the height  limits (I was only @NUM2 and “4.@NUM2”ft tall @CAPS2 I wasn’t tall enough for most of the, @CAPS4  rides ,my dad saw that I was tall enough for the @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We walk around looking for the ride and more importantly he line. So we finally??? the ride my attention was drawn from the ride to the  line ,my mouth practicely hit the ground with the expression  “@CAPS7 luck getting to the that ride”, my father looked at me than my sister  “ where is mom and will?” I pointed over by the faress whell being covard of course. So we just get in the line and sign, it was at least @NUM4 something degrees. we waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got into the chair and a bar came over us, I remember one thing set a quarter on  your leg and gravity takes a hold of it . A minute @CAPS8 we are going down like a neteour the quarter doesn’t float @CAPS9!  At that split second were on solid ground now the ride was not really worth the wait, but hey I’m not a covard.
1	15	16	One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They so, dit would only take @NUM1 ??? days so, I said “ok that’s not to so days flew by and hats were supposed to come in the mail that day so when us truck came by I was so exited but there was a box for my mom.”@CAPS1.” I said I was really, so planted but I thought to myself they i.e. come tomorrow and??? the didn’t come so I as stil patient but close to not being two more days past so I just gave up then one day when I got home from my friends house they were there yes, finally all my patients payed off and thats the time I had patients.
2	19	17	Have you ever been patient?  I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. “I’m sorry but @PERSON1 won’t be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that you’d like to do your @CAPS1?’ A perplexed expression spread across my face. “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?” I asked. “yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o’clock. “she suggested. “that’s fine.”  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didn’t get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has it’s advantages.
0	16	16	One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online it said three day shipping and to me it wasn’t very long. When the third day came and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in @LOCATION1 and it wouldn’t be here until next week. after she told me I figured that did just have to be patient, as for the next week I just went to work with my dad. after my week was up, and I was sitting on my porch waiting and I almost fell asleep when a @ORGANIZATION1 truck came and gave me my brand new helmet.
2	22	20	Patience. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was at my sister’s house playing  wii with my niece, when my brother in law matt comes into the living room and says, “@CAPS1 bored, lets do something today!’’ @CAPS2 we all decided that we would go to michigans adventures for the day. My sister @PERSON1 told us to pack the coler with snacks and drinks and to put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to @CAPS3 to go to six flags and that @PERSON1, matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours i moaned “are we there yet?’’ “no.’’ said @PERSON1 “were lost” “oh”  I replyed. But I really didn’t think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment. I stretched and squinted from the sun’s  raise when my eye adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at six flags! When we got in the first ride we rode was the supeman on that ride you sit and things lock around your legs and stomache and i tilts you over @CAPS2 its like your flying we wanted to ride it @CAPS2 bad but the line was @NUM1 ½ hours long. While we were standing in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I spy and all sorts of things and when we finally were on and off the ride I realized that it was really fun, and worth it and that i was patient and didn’t complain.
2	8	10	My friend an I were wateng to go no a new ride at @CAPS1 font. The ride was cold shoateng the cat. Is it was a water ride we wated. Over @NUM1 hours to go on if it. Was bouring after that we went on. The cowrcscrowe it was fun.
10	16	6	When your at a store or the doctor or anywhere where you have wait for something you always have to have patience or you wiil never be able to do anything. I remember when i was at the store with my mom we had to wait in this long  line just to buy a few groceries but if didn’t  have patience we would put are stuff back and went back home but sense we did  have patience we got to buy are stuff. That why, if you dont have you won’t be able to do anything you wanna do.
1	9	10	Patience is a very long task @CAPS2 the rewards out weigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to a line to a rollar coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However many people are not very patient. (@CAPS1 me) @CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. In short, be @CAPS1 a trile and lots of patience.
1	10	11	One time I was patient because, the teacher had to tell me something. So I wated by the door but then she had to go to the office so I had to wate. When the teacher came back she told me thanks for being patient. Patients really means you can wait. Some kids don’t be patient they get so made for example, there was @NUM1 kids in one group we were playing a game and they would get so made because they didn’t get called on a lol. But the game was radom you pick stick and who ever sticks it was went. So being patients mean you have to able to wait.
2	7	5	Patience is when you can wait for a long pereied and not complain I don’t think I have very much patience. I think patience is like waiting in a line for hour’s and not careing because you are very patinct but every thing takes patience games, driveing, eating waiting and even being at school all taken lot of patience.
2	18	16	Patience, if you are a patient person you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time I was very patient. ""@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 go yet!? ""@CAPS2,"" she replied, ""@CAPS3 need to buy all of your school supplies."" I always didn't like back to school shopping. That would mean going with @CAPS1 to a store for @NUM1 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencils binders and pens. ""@CAPS4 I really have to go too?"" ""@CAPS5 patient ok?"" ""@CAPS6, I replied. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I began to get more patient. Whenever I had to wait for @CAPS1. I just sat there, I just sat down and waited. And the day seemed to go by a lot faster @CAPS7 had been @NUM1 hours but @CAPS7 only felt like twenty minutes, when @CAPS3 left. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again!
1	17	16	The time I was patient was whene I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end if they made  it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient.
0	24	24	“@CAPS1!”I yaled as the ball came over the net right to me. ” That was @CAPS1!”@CAPS2 said.  “@CAPS3 I was already there.”I responded.  “@CAPS4. @CAPS3 it’s @CAPS1.” @CAPS13 argued.  “@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you??? Moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. “@CAPS7 I guess.”@CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. “@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!” the A team coach demanded. “@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!”@CAPS13 said??? Mu two best friends som and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. “You want to be partners with me and make? “@CAPS14 asked. “@CAPS15, “I responded. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11 we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. “@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!”??? One of the coaches. It was the end of the second @DATE1 tryouts. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was hard for me @CAPS3 I managed to keep together and patient. On the @DATE1 of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A-team! So that’s a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still came through and succeeded.
7	17	24	Being patient isn’t always that easy, in fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with @NUM1 rude, screaming and crying kids for @NUM2 hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great @CAPS3 davn in???. with my grandpa. My @CAPS1 pa is fan bag to talk to, @CAPS2 later than I found out my @NUM1 younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @CAPS2 my cousins brought??? loud noisy and flossy toys they bot just for the ride. As we started heading for @LOCATION1 I turned my ipod on and found out it only had @PERCENT1 battery left. Half way there I was almost dad of borden, @CAPS2 the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep I decided to join them. WACK! I auske is a sobbery slap to the face, “were here” my cousin enchoired, finally I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore, and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my @CAPS3, it was about @NUM4 hrs and my cousins were all asleep again and I knew it was going to be a nice ride home.
3	20	17	Patience is when your understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasn’t even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters’ face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.
6	21	15	Sitting in the car waiting for @CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and into the car.When she got in the ca    we were off.On the way to the???  For the @CAPS1 party I got pretty bored after about a couple minutes,when got out of midland I thought  it would go by preety fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever.I was bored out of @CAPS2 mind and the thing s that made it worse was that @CAPS2 little sisters were screaming in the back.So  then we stoped at a gas station witch felt like forever.I preety  much never talked the whole way up there I was trying to be patient but I  couldn’t take it.I manged to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming.They finally fall asleep.I just sat there loking out the window when we where about forty-five  minutes away it felt like we have been driving for days.It was probly like @NUM1 minutes away when the girls finally wake up.They started screaming “Are we there yet”@CAPS2 mom and dad just keep saying “@CAPS3”When we pulled into the drive way it was probly the happiest thing that happened hat day.I thought I was preety patient on the way up there but on the way back I might just sleep.At the party I was  patient  until we could open the presents.I freacked  out.I hope next time none of that will happen.
0	16	16	Don't you ever whis ever one in the world would be patience, @CAPS4 if you don't I do. Lucky   for me one time I was a not so good girl and I did something I was not suppos to do, but since I have such grate parent they were trying there best to be patience with me, like all parent they had to give me a lecksore about what I did, but they did not let me got out of the hock that easy. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 please come down to the office"" I herd on the anoament, @CAPS6 I was walking down one hallway I was really??? ""what have I done"" I ask myself, I was thinking really hard. By no time I was at the office ""yes"" I said to the person that was there ""Do you now why your hear"" @CAPS3 said ""no"" I replayed. ""@CAPS4 I been having some complain from these  girl"" @CAPS3 had told me ""@CAPS4 oo ya"" I said ""@CAPS4 ya what"" @CAPS3 said ""was the only reason why I was bing mean was because they were bing mean and they were bing so suck up they would tell my friends that the only reason I hanged out with them was because they had money wich was not true"" I said ""ok I get were your comeing from, let me call them down"" @CAPS3 said."" @CAPS5 and alesay come down to the office please."" @CAPS6 they came down the hallway I could hear there foot step. I really did not want to talk to them to be contined.
2	10	12	I was patient when I was at home yesterday watching the movie called @CAPS1. So I waited for a long time until the food was ready and he?? I was so interested in the movie that I couldn`t get my eyes of the t.v because the movie was so good until when I was really hungry then after that I had a second plate after that second plate I didn`t get to eat the rest of my food. And I didn`t complain that I was hungry.
3	22	19	One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself “nothing will get in my way” well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. That’s when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minuets. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn’t so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something.
1	16	15	Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didn’t say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didn’t go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children… I don’t like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are “guardian parents” they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.
5	17	12	I am in the middle of being, well trying to be patient right now. You see @CAPS1 my birthday coming up my cell phone is not working that ??? I told my mom that I needed a new phone. She is  illegible so I have to be patience just hoping and we thing ??? super cool! @CAPS1  the is nv @CAPS2. I don't know which ???  Being patient is really haid. Being patient involves not whining ?? no and mw yelling. Patient can sometimes come with ??? that ??? . so I'll be patient and see how it oges.
1	17	16	I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future.
2	19	17	The time I needed patience. We were on the groccery store, @CAPS1 man to be exact.m When we first got there I was exited because we were going to get lots of junk bad, but ther. We started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to just eat it all. The cart was half way. ??? @CAPS7 we got more stuff and it was @CAPS3 full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. But the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said “@CAPS2 me just get a couple one things.” @CAPS3 I waited, and waited @CAPS7 she told me to go to checkout. All of them were @CAPS3 long and I felt like I was ???(@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6) @CAPS7 this little girl walked up to me getting smart I couldn’t take it, I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself @CAPS3, @CAPS7 I realized it was our turn and I was @CAPS3 happy. @CAPS7 when I got home mom cooked bacos and I was just ready to go to bed.
1	13	12	One thing I am not very at ient with is the meap. The reason I am not patient with the meap because it is very boring you can not talk and it is dull. I hate the meap it is very difficult, you don’t see tenn see or @CAPS1 doing the meap. The meap expect you to do to much work the meap is one of the reason I dislike michgan. The meap asking you questions and words you never saw or herd before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we are going to do meap I wou ld prefer them to ask question and words that we know. Another thing I dont like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion they grade of what they think of it. To mi the meap is stupid @CAPS2 I had a choice I would chose not to do it. Since the meap is important I do it for my grade. These are the reason why I am very inpatient with the meap.
2	17	19	There are many times when l’ve been patient but here are just a few. It was a late afternoon my family & I were supposed to go to a big function that day. Like always I didn’t know what I was going to wear, about an hour later I found what I was going to wear. I went down stairs to the soon no one was ready & we only had @NUM1 1/@NUM1 an hour left. I was frustrated told everyone to go get ready, but nobody listened to me. But I didn’t care so I went up to fore a shower right  when was as out to go in my mom come and told me I had to wait ??? She took a shower. Then one by one everyone took a shower except for me. I was loosing my patients. I still waited because I didn’t want to start a commotion. Finally I went into take a shower. We were all dressed & ready to go. At the last minutes when we all got in the car, my sister for got her bag & jacket so we had to wait till she got it. We finally made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few exam pies of me showing patients is when I waited to take a or over when in waited for my sister to got her lay a jacket.
0	9	9	Once I was patient, I want to go they football with my dad but didn’t want to. So when he was puting shoe on when I would ask him to come play football he would take his shone off. Then I had to wait two and half hour just for him to get one shone on. When he was putting second shon I didn’t say anything so. We faihl when and play football. That’s how I learn if you use your patience on will to be able to do some safe.
4	11	15	Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you don’t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that’s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences.
2	22	24	Patience can lead to rewards, @PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1. He might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting @PERSON3. One day @PERSON4 seen a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline in a newspaper. He put @NUM1 in the machine and opened the newspaper holder to grad one, it was jammed.  He went into the gas station to tell the people but they were not there, he hit the top of the bell and nobody came .@PERSON4 was trying to be as patient as possible .He went to a different store and got newspaper there. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  was  that his favorite star ,@PERSON2 ,was going to be in town  .Can hurried  to buggle town and seen the line that was @NUM2 long ???.He was so excited to see @PERSON3. @PERSON4 got to the line at @TIME2 and has been there for @NUM3 hour and she only got @NUM4 autographs done .This was going to be a long day for @PERSON4. @PERSON4 got a hot dog and  a soda from the sidewalle food business  at @NUM5 p.m .@PERSON4 was still the last person in line his patience went down quite a bit .At @TIME3 there were only @NUM6  people  including him there . He finally got to @PERSON3 at @TIME4 @PERSON3 and her crew notified @PERSON4 that he won the patience contest .They told him be gets to see her in concert, gets  her phone number  and wins a date with her. He was so happy he kept himself patient for fife hours. @PERSON4 was about to blow at @TIME1 knew he would never forgot this moment .Also, @PERSON4 ended up being @PERSON3’s boyfriend. That is when @PERSON4 learned that patience can pay off in the end.
1	20	19	Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I had been in the waiting room for nearly the whole time. The nurses kept giving me updates, to calm me, to no avail. So I @CAPS1 out a smoke to ease my nerves. I didn’t know if my wife, or our baby would live. Would it live happy? I just @CAPS1 a puff of smoke, and waited for hours I sat, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own thoughts. Would it be picked on? I sat, ignoring the nurses pleading, trying to reassure me. Would it shut life out? I sat, waiting for my newborn child. My silence was broken, by a baby crying. I rushed over to my wife’s room, to find her holding a beutiful baby girl. “@CAPS1 you long enough”
1	16	15	One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.
5	16	11	@CAPS4  @CAPS1 lives in ohio. He goes to @CAPS2 middle school and day after school he was walking home when @CAPS3 his friend asked him to wait in the parking lot for him so that he could call his mother and ask if  @CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. @CAPS4 had to wait an entire half hour while @CAPS3 talked and argued with his mother. But after @CAPS3 finished talking thanked @CAPS4 for being patient and they all spent the weekend at @CAPS8 house.
0	19	19	On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well that’s what I thought but no it was jamed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked “what are you doing.” @CAPS1 I said “I see a doe,” @CAPS1 he said “then shoot it,” & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, “I missed” I said all that patience for nothing.
2	18	16	A @DATE2 ago my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because of her incision from a previous operation panste open. Because of @DATE2 physical coller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it.
1	7	8	In some point you have to be patient. If you are in a line need to be patient. you have to be patient to waiting for a share to part. You have to be patient if something is coming in the mid and you can as wait to what is or you no what it is and you just can’t ran to get it. When you go to the store and you see some thing you want and have mom or dad say they will git you for your brithbay then you can no wait for you bathbay then you can no wait for you birthday.Well I have been there . I love crismase because you got almose everything you want; When something you to do something you have been wanting forever you are going there for the first time. All of these thing you have to be patient.
1	23	24	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousin’s house to watch her daughter @CAPS1’ @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn’t wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldn’t hush. Tthen I said, “ @NUM1 , what’s the matter ?” @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didn’t complain to @CAPS1’@CAPS4’s mom.
2	16	18	@PERSON2 and her twin brother, @PERSON1 waited excitingly in line for a concert. @PERSON1 hated going place with his sister, she was @CAPS6 weird. â€œ@CAPS1,â€ @CAPS2 whined. â€œ@CAPS3, @PERSON1@NUM1 asked take an earbud out of her car. â€œ@CAPS4 did I have @CAPS8 come?â€ @CAPS2 asked impatiently. â€œ@CAPS6 you could learn how @CAPS8 be patient, smart one,â€ @PERSON2 said looking @CAPS8 see how many people were in line now. @PERSON2 put her ear bud back in her car and blasted â€˜@CAPS7 @CAPS8 The @CAPS9 Of @CAPS10 @CAPS11â€™ by allstar weekend. Allstar weekend the awesome band they would see in concert. @PERSON2 had always been the patient twin in fact that @CAPS3 everyone called her. @CAPS2 was the complete oppisite of her, the impatient twin. @PERSON2 almost enjoyed waiting it made her more excited for things.When then time finally came @CAPS8 see the concert @PERSON2 was glad she was patient; she was ten time more excited then anyone else there.
6	16	10	Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didn’t because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait.
1	20	19	As a child my mom always. My be patient well I couldn’t do I’m writing this about her. My mom is very nice, cool, wealthy, and most of all patient.  As many thing I did as  a chid, and still some hour my mom just calm her  self down like we didn’t even do anything. it’s kinda funny how much patient  she  has. Along time ago. I remember wasting grape pop on her new carpet!!   Wow how scared did I get….I think I wet my pants!! @CAPS4 instead of hiding it like any other kid when she got home I cried to @CAPS3 I wasted pop on your carpet don’t get mad “she replied in her soothing mother loving voice,” @CAPS1 me exage to clean it up. “I passed her a dry towel and siled just remember this time a kid I can`t reach the sink`s) @CAPS4 with out yelling she walked she walked up stairs and wet the towel her self. I stayed down stairs look at the @CAPS2 purple mess I made trying to help my mom,” just sit down .” she say holding my hand.by this time momma got don with the stain I was fast a sleep on the couch. My mom gave me a kiss on the cheek @CAPS4 she doesn’t woke up!!The gig was up soon as she picked me up. “@CAPS3 is that you??” I said in my morning voice. My mom being @CAPS4 patient.” @CAPS4 what`s for breakfast??.” in a high piten voice. I will get on it” she said will taking out my breakfast.  I love my momo.
4	16	12	A time when I was patient was when I was at the dentists on the to get a cavity filled. When we got there they said my appointment wasn’t for another a??? but my mom didn’t want to leave. I was so??? TV was on???.When it finally was my turn it took the???or who is also my ???about another??? hour to get ready. A learning experience is ??? learned to be patient when someone  takes to long to do nothing
5	21	16	I must admit there are times when I’m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, “You have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also.
0	15	15	Patience is a special skill for some people and some its very hard. When I was a little girl I was never had any patience and even now. I do not have any either but my friend was always patient for me yah she would tell me to hurry up or lll leave but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and jekc it to the pound that’s what she would always do to. Patience I will probebly never lean till @CAPS1 like older but I know I will learn it someday. One time my friend waited for @NUM1 hours just to learn about history I would have never learned that my but then again she did get ??? ???? on her @CAPS2 homework. so her patience for that was like really cool and she told me that patience is a number one priority. his was one time my friend had patience.
0	13	13	Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION1 state game. My dad was Patient and that is unusual because he is normally in patient. So we where surprised. when we got in the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and @CAPS1 sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move it took about a half in hour for them to find as and again my dad was patient but the @CAPS1 at us could not wait and we started to set very angry when security got there  we had to wait for them to ghoole our rist barn he was still patient and after that we got a seats I was slat but the rezzon my dad was patient was because he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium so he stayed  patient and stayed calm.
5	15	20	My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights untill we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours untill we got there. Then we checked are bags went throug securely, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. Then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride untill we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there.
3	8	5	I was patience wen I wanted my thot @NUM1 and I hod to wait to my b-day to get it I was patience to get my new fone but I had to be good and school and that was hard for me because I use to all ways be bad and staff like that I use to want everything but I use to have to be patience and I use to always be good to get it.
1	16	17	This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was a two days before I had to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots, I never liked shots because they hurt and make you fill sleepy. I usally never have patient’s but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor. I experience why people should have patient and it’s easy to do. Today was my doctors appointment and I was scared. When I walked in the clinic I always fill sick and tired.  My mom will go sign my name in and I fill more sicker because I will worry about how many shots I will have to get. My doctor had call me and I was terrified my mom always told me that it don’t hurt if  you don’t look at it. So I went back to the doctor office and my doctor told me to get on the scale, I was really he gave me an hearing test and a eye test. I asked if I have to get any shots he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finish with my hearing test, I was finish and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and I learn how to have patients. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor.
1	14	13	I guess you could say that patience is one of my bang talents. I go through many things that involve patience and a ve it through without awed . Everything knows that the wortplore to be patient in is church eserc?????? On chass?????.  You are up, then meel down, then start , the  sit then, @PERSON1 and ok! It @CAPS1 on forever. Boh  so  I  know that there  are  a lot of  kids  that  went  as  patent  as  me, some  of  them have  @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of  other lirastings  that  make  them  impatient while  others  in   just  ????  you are.  I know   ???  People who are like that there reals anersetic????   ????  can’t  here still  I know that   wostoe  there  nopele  struggle  in  school and  I feel  bad  foe them.  There are times that start to feel impatient when there are other people????  that are impatient. Its  worst  is  I sat  impatient  with them  and I set  frustrate  because  no  matter  ????  ??   times  I  tell them to   stre tuppin, there pencil  as  to stop complaining  the just  don’t  stop.  I guess what  I’m saying  is  that  every  bodys different some  people  are  quiet and  someone   but, some  peak are  atutatic while  others  are  academic.  Is no different with patience
1	16	17	When I was really patient when I wonti my pcar and mother to cook me some lazuge. I did not haved any of it scence my pass away is @DATE1. My mom had my @CAPS1  to cook @CAPS2 on my first birthday. when she cooked some for my first birthday party it was all goned. My @CAPS3 mother cooked @NUM1 pans of it. It was so good it was gone soon as she had put it out when I say soon I mean soon. I turned @NUM2 years old. My mother did it big for my birthday party. My mom died from open heart sergrey. She was @NUM3 years old. She had alto friends at her furnal. The furnal was very nice. But getting back to what I was writing about so In @DATE2 I asked my @CAPS1. To cook me some . She said ito me girl it coust to much to make it. I said @CAPS1 do you want me to gived you some money to cook the food, for me. She said no save your little money that you have. I said but @CAPS1 it’s okay to take my money to buy my lazangae and cook it for me. She said girl what did I say. So I hurry up and put my money in my pocket. Then I was keeping it moving. When we got in the truck she said now @CAPS5 I am going to cook it for when I get some , more, money, and when I pay my bills. In @DATE3 she cooked me some. The day she cooked me some it was @CAPS6 @NUM4, @DATE3. My antyes came over a got some, my brother and sister got some, and my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some. When they all wont I some I stood there and watch them get some, and when to stop getting some. Selfer when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some.

1	18	17	Boom! Boom! I knew my cousins were at the door because they were all heavy handed. So I ran down stairs and opend the door it was them. Then, we all got into the van you all read to have some fun my mom all, we replied @CAPS1 !!!” it was so bouring in the van but I had to be patient. After, we got to ohio we stoped and got some food .After @NUM1 mins we got into the van .When we got to ??? point we were all excited it was going to be a good day I thought but I also knew that it was going to take some time and patience .Next ,when we got into the park we all when’t  straight to the reptor  .It was a half  an hour  right .This was going to take a lot of patients so we wated and wated  when we got on and off we realized it was worth it. They we got on a lot of ride .but the best one was the diagster .When we got to the van we all said it was fun. Then I relised  I was  very  patient
1	12	13	My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.
0	24	24	This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello.
2	10	12	Patience is probalbly  one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probalbly like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probalbly get a “@CAPS1 you” from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park ride’s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important.
1	8	7	Without patience a person can be very easily broken. Without patience a person can be easily trigger to as something horrible like myself I have patience but a certain time I sometimes don’t have patience. Without patience the whole world be out of control so that who most plans of business try to hate there???as first as possible. So that what all this was patience.
3	19	16	Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time but when your impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was @CAPS1 impatient. My brother @PERSON1 and I were waiting for a new video game to come out but it comes out in @NUM1 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, @NUM2. Then waited another day @NUM3. He wasted @NUM4 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade drope to a @CAPS2+ and now he’s blaming @CAPS3! So I told him hard @NUM5sucsess. He tried harder @CAPS4- he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is @NUM6, he’s a lot happier now that hes patient using time wisely while keeping himself occupied.
1	20	21	“@CAPS1 were gonna be late!” yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. “@CAPS1 were gonna be late!” yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily.You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parmls, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1’s parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to ???? “@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seamed to grow twice their size. “@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4!  Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!” @PERSON1 yelled??? . Though she made it sound like “???” I smilled and we began tro play. She would guess??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patoient to leave by helping her play a game.Finally my parents walked outside and we began our skitrip. Patience had payed off.
3	14	11	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 was a patient ??, @CAPS2 decided to order a pizza them ???. The delivery man tells @CAPS2 that would be at his house in fifteen minutes. @CAPS2 was still waiting for his pizzas after fifteen minutes. And how late the  delivery man will with they ??? after being late. @CAPS2 said that he dosnt care.
3	14	11	You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to???P A last @DATE1. I had to be patient to @NUM1 hours before me and my family arrived. The next day I had to be more patient because we went to an amuesmed park. There I had to wait in very long lines,’@CAPS1 is really hard to be patient. Is @CAPS1 hard for you to be patient. That’s the story when I had patience.
0	24	24	There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2’d been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. “@CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour.” @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement “I’m sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.” @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard “@CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.” @CAPS6 a big “ughhh” swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5.
3	17	14	One important skill you need in the life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient payed off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even more. Then I played sports after a had my coat cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough.
5	13	18	Yester day I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. @CAPS1 took a little while but @CAPS1 was my turn next. When I got home I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though @CAPS1 was only an hour until @CAPS1 would be ready @CAPS1 seemed like @CAPS1 was a life time. The delicoas aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat pationtly and read my book until @CAPS1 was done. After words I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with thier toys. So I had to pause the show because they cant do anything when the @CAPS2 is on. So patiently, I waited for a excruciaing @NUM1 minutes until they were done. So over all I think I was very patient yesterday.
2	12	10	On the way back home from a doctors??? .I was getting annoyed about being??? I did not want mom to get annoyed more. So I tryed  a great to be pacient. Once a while I would play with the seat .@NUM1 minutes have passed and I was getting more in patient. Buy I still keep +roln  .Once I got home I went to bea  and relaxed
3	18	21	My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, “@CAPS1’s one mom” “sweet,” she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience.
3	14	17	I was patent when I was waiting for a chance to go to cicago. I really wanted to go see the windy city because my mom went to @LOCATION1. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in awhile it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn’t bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I keept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn’t care about @LOCATION1. No mater how tempting it was seing @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 hawks game on I kept my cool. Then it happened @MONTH1 @DATE1, imagen that it was @NUM1 and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nut shell no mater how long it took, I would be patient.
4	17	21	One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctor’s appointment and over slept; when @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctor’s appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed he rushed in the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed   it was grilling later so he didn’t get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a part of gum on the way out the door. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctors went inside and saw there were millions of people in the waiting  room, he went to go check his name in and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired   of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 kept his self busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn’t realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called   in @LOCATION1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into his the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep.
4	11	15	Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience.
3	23	20	On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in little travers bay for salmon, there was a tromendus hep on the trolling line, I lanched from where I was sitting like a rocket I heaved on the line I waited. I thought it was a false alarm (snag) put trust me I thought wrong. the pull did a dance then bent realy fast again. ''@CAPS2 on,"" I yelled to my cosin, he ran back to my aid. We @CAPS4 stared at the water the poll still flexed didn't move, I was looking for the tumble weed because I felt like I was in an old western movie stand of. Finale I looked at my cousin & said, ''I have been patient, do you think I should real him up""? ""@CAPS3 me get the net first'', he fumed and grabed it then stated ""When you are ready"" I slowly cranced the handle on the real tie, tie, as I slowly cranted him from l??freaky depths. Then out of no where the steel cable that was my line shot from the ball like a bullet, but the a cyrick jerk from him and then the line went slak. My cosin & I @CAPS4 knew what had happened. the @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to flustrat more fisher men with his patient ways.
2	18	20	One day during the @DATE1 my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient.
5	19	14	One time when I was patient was when my mom’s car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called called her back and she said she can’t make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 mile and @PERSON1 where the was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1 where my school is. That was time when I was patient.
7	12	19	@CAPS14 can I go over @CAPS1 house after school to dayâ€ asked @CAPS2. â€œIâ€™ll call and tell the school, okay?â€ answered her @CAPS14. You are problely worried who is @CAPS1 is. @CAPS10 she is @CAPS2 best friend in the world they have been friends sease the were in dapiers.

So me and my @CAPS16 grew up to be the best of friend just like one and @PERSON1. Thatâ€™s what happned when one bw a little patient
2	21	19	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasn’t coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a bird’s eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.
4	16	12	One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.
1	10	9	Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don’t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patients I wouldn’t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don’t have and they get bad grades and everything.
3	18	15	The time I was patient was when my sister droped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didn’t get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her faught, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didn’t. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and that’s the time I was patient.
3	13	10	I have to be patient all the time when I’m teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong when are you patient? @PERSON1 is a new part of my family and he is still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things every day and when I go over it like @NUM1 times I get kind a mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just learning and to be patient with him it helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things and if I’m patient he will learn faster
4	12	8	Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit about being patient. (@NUM1) patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shoping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t then you could get into an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. (@NUM2) being patient is important. If you have kids your impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience.
3	7	4	On @DATE1 we went to the doller tree I want to go to the game stop. But I was patient then we went to the game stop.
1	17	18	It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong.
3	14	17	Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something then you don’t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn’t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn’t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now
2	17	15	Everyone has been patient at one time of their. I know I have. A year my brother and I had a projet to do. That we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Being that there is one computer in the house I have to wait. After hours I checked to see if my brother was close to being done. He was not, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a slow typer. He finished the next day. In had no problem with it because I had lots of time to type my paper. This is the time I was patient.
4	16	12	One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming  out. I asked my dad @CAPS1 we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until @CAPS2. So I waited until @CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents @CAPS4 and & me my brother went to play it.
2	18	16	When ll was going to @LOCATION1 with my family I had to be patient. Our flight left at @TIME1 am so we were there at @NUM1. We waited for two hours. Nobody complained because we each had something to do. Me and @PERSON1 were playing video games, and my mom was reading ,When we finnaly got on the plane it took three hours to get to @LOCATION1 and no one complained then either. So this is the story of the time when nobody complaind for five hours!
2	21	19	Do you ever fell like your @CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at @TIME1pm my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @PERSON2, and my friend @LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said ""I didnt want you to walk to get @LOCATION2 by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already @NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store @LOCATION1 questioned me and asked ""@CAPS2 did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as @PERSON2 pushed the @PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my @CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again.
6	11	5	Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something with out complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience  but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is.
0	19	19	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a few days after @CAPS18 began to run, @CAPS3, a small, anxious, chestnut room @CAPS1 saw her @CAPS5 plowing a large oval and covering it with @CAPS4 looked like dust. ""@CAPS4's @CAPS5 doing, @CAPS6? "" @CAPS7 a very curious @CAPS3. ""@CAPS9's plowing."" @CAPS10 @CAPS11, the young horses' @CAPS17. ""@CAPS12's going to be in a race called the @ORGANIZATION1  next year and that's how @CAPS18 will practice."" I want to race! ""hollered @CAPS3 excitedly ""Patience my darling, you're not even a filly! ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11, conclusively. And so @CAPS3 waited patiently for weeks. When @CAPS18 could @CAPS18 ran the track at night. @CAPS18 counted her times and @CAPS18 got faster and stronger. Two years later @CAPS3 was the champion reached for @NUM1 years in a raw. ""@CAPS17 was right! ""@CAPS18 claimed ""Patience is the key!
1	17	18	Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 she said back was “@CAPS2, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday” @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now I’m patient every day.
2	19	21	Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  “@CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ??????  And I do not want to be late for school again”. I hollered at my @CAPS4 “@CAPS1”, @CAPS4 said in a hustled voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesn’t take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient.” “I know, I know, I sighed but I still don’t want to be late” “I know but remember, being patient will get you far.” “@CAPS6” I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didn’t whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didn’t cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didn’t grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldn’t be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on.
2	17	15	I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time.
3	11	8	My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday.He goes to work and can’t want to come home, but he doesn’t go crazy  like me cause I wanna leave. No ,he does his work and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He always patiently waits till @NUM1. My dad always been a patient person andto look  up to him because of that patience .
0	22	22	I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. They’re so boring. Especially the @CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing  I’m not the most patient person, so that’s probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long ‘story about patience. “Do we have to go?” I moaned to @CAPS4 mother. “@CAPS1 its @PERSON1’s wedding and it’s important.” “@CAPS2.” I had to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin @LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. “@CAPS3 on!” @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1. When we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma. “@CAPS5?” @CAPS4 mom answered. “@CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,”  “@CAPS8. That’s bad. We’re in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?”  “@CAPS10, but I’m sure you’ll make it in time to be there,”  “@CAPS11. That’s good. @CAPS12.” “@CAPS12.” @CAPS13, as if on we, he reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings. “@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?” @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrvied home. “@CAPS16? I asked.” @CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even the car ride was kind of @CAPS16.”  “@CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type.” “@CAPS1” I said and I was proud.
6	14	8	I was at the great wolf loge and we could not go in because some kid poop in the pool and a big part of the pool was brown we could not go in for three hours and it was very boring then we went outside and there was a pool there the hole time.
2	16	14	One time I was patient was when I was going to @LOCATION1 because the car ride was @NUM1 hours long. I was hungery, bored, and really needed to use the bathroom. I didn’t tell nobody because I knew we could not stop. I looked out the window but got bored. We were going to @LOCATION3, I was happy we stop and eat in @LOCATION3, I know that from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION3 is not a long way but hey I eat at @NUM2 and is like noon. We finally eat like having and hour in @LOCATION3. I did really good being paitent, because when I am unpaitent I get really mood and people don’t want to be with me when I’m mood.
2	20	18	Oh I have a great story about patience!  One day, I was my @CAPS1's and @CAPS2's house. There was my two brothers my little sister, my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and myself present. My, @CAPS2 was ready to serve up ice cream  @CAPS4 of a sudden, my brothers and sisters started yelling, I 'm going first, I'm  going first! Lathan ?, my @CAPS2 asked? I responded by saying, I 'm not being a part of this! I thoyah you @CAPS6 how long is this going to go on since this was @CAPS4 getting mea  little freaky, I sad, @CAPS7! Get in line! They were like ok. So, patich tly, every one art  in the line and took their lurh choosing what kind of ice cream they wamted. And what a choice we had vanilla, strawberry, mint, of cookie dough ice cream. Ever one settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cone.
0	21	21	Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didn’t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years.
1	16	15	There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn’t go on to the next part. Also we couldn’t talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldn’t talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didn’t no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year I’m alway patient. That a story on when I’m patient.
1	20	19	“@CAPS1 you buy @CAPS10 yet?” I yelled across the room “@CAPS2 not yet lets get @CAPS10 @CAPS4” my dad said back to me. I was buying a sooter on the internet and @CAPS10 was being shipped from @LOCATION1. @CAPS10 said the scooter will get her in five to eight buisness days. “@CAPS3” I yelled as I bought @CAPS10 “@CAPS4 all that’s left to do is wait. The next morning  I woke up at six am to catch the bus to school during on my classes all I could think about was the scooters. Patience @CAPS5- patience, I thought. After school I would go to close country intill @NUM1 when my parents would pick me up. Five business days finaly come “I cant wait any more” I yelled. After close country my mom drove me home and I cprinted to the main box “darm @CAPS10!” I said “@CAPS6 yeah the website tried to charge our credit card extra money so we had to cancel @CAPS10. “@CAPS7 @CAPS5” my mom said “lets buy you a new one” “@CAPS8” @CAPS9 scooter finaly arrives three buisness days later. “@CAPS10’s about time” I said with joy.
1	16	15	On my way to @LOCATION1 to visit my dad. While in the car there is food and I brought along my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 to keep me busy, I brought my @CAPS1 along because it would be annoying if I ask are we there yet?” very @NUM1 minutes, and I knew that a @NUM2 hr drive would need some intertament. Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast, if I don’t play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cusihs, @PERSON1, and sleep. After awhile of that I sit back and relax. The whole trip is @NUM2 hrs but by doing all that it seems to be more like @NUM4 or @NUM5 hrs.
0	17	17	One sunny beutful day I went out and was driving my glad around and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new good in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and she said I couldn’t go @CAPS5 I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play playstation @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) @CAPS5 I was playing far two hours strait, and then I decided to go watch @CAPS6 assassain  (@CAPS7) . After that was com I went back to play in playstation @NUM1(p.s.@NUM1.), again. played it for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, @CAPS5 I look out the window, and it was my .  @CAPS1 ma. Then we talked bout the new qlad and then I hear beep, beep and it was my . my .  new @CAPS8!. Then I ran out took it out and roud it for like @NUM3 hours strait. That is how I had patient for about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours long. I was proud of myself after I was done riding my new @CAPS8.
0	15	15	Once apani time there were to kids one was name @CAPS1 he wasn’t patience at all. The other kid was name @PERSON1 he be was patience. They went for a walk in the woods and get lost @CAPS1 would not stop complaining. @PERSON1 told him stop complaining @CAPS3 @CAPS1 didn’t until he say a hunted house @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 want to go inside with him. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 didn’t want to go in so @CAPS1 went in and act like he got hurt so @PERSON1 ran in there the dorslamd shut and the door nob feel off. They were scared it was dark. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said lets get at of here! @PERSON1 said how the door nob fell off. @CAPS1 said I don’t know they ran though the house there wore no other door or windows the were terrify then a ghost was coming at them and he said happy @CAPS7 it was there dad he built the house for them and said all you had to do is push the door open. and they all went home. the end
1	13	12	One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you don’t know what that is I’ll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn’t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met.
2	18	16	A time when had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 it’s about @NUM1 hrs away. So I had to sit in a car for @NUM1 hours. The only things to do were listen to your ipod and sleep. Which I didn’t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like @NUM4 if you weren’t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping. I knew I couldn’t do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2. This was a time when I had patience
0	16	16	One day we were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event to see the president of the united states of @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 when we got to the park where we going to see him there were cars parked a mile away! When we finally parked the car we started walking it was a long walk but when we finally got to the gate I was excited! after we got through security we though we would never get there. Me and my parents stood in that I think for about two hours until finally everybody spread out and look their places sang the national anthem the president stepped up to the podium and gave along speech. It was the longest line I ever stood in and I was very patient.
3	21	24	@CAPS3 was about a @NUM1 hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, @CAPS1 and I were going to see buddy guy and @CAPS3 was going to be a @NUM1 and a half hour concert. As we pulled in the parking lot, the policeman guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into @CAPS3. We got out and drank pop and ate sand whiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about @NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but @CAPS2 never did. After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked â€œhow long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?â€ â€œabout five minutes.â€ @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. â€œhow long?â€ â€œsix now.â€ @CAPS3 wouldnâ€™t have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. â€œThe performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.â€ @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, @CAPS2 walked on stage. @CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed @CAPS3 even more. We packed out for the rest of the night.
1	11	10	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.
5	24	19	Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear “@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.” so I got up and checked it @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at @NUM2 all from @CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong. I called him back and I hear” @CAPS1 get ready grandm @CAPS4 I coming to get you. “I said it`s @NUM3 @CAPS5 are you nuts?” at this time I was at a family members house @CAPS8 @CAPS6 dad said “@PERSON2 was in a bad crush.” @CAPS6 heart drop and I started crying.” get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info.” I got off phone @CAPS6 aunt was up she came into the room I told her what I knew. I was getting @CAPS6 stuff together try not ta wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call everything went through @CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, is be ok is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard beep beep I said good bye and ran out. Running made me think of more like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car I questioned @CAPS6 grandma asking her where is mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7 are they ok: when will I see him? All I knew in had to be patience. @CAPS8 I got the call I asked @CAPS6 dad “what happen what did he hit, who called @NUM4, where do we go?” the first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dads mouth was” calm down I can`t come home but @PERSON1 will be there I want you to stay with him ok” yes dad I will and dad” I said” you” he said back. I said ‘I love you.” “I love you too” he said. The worst time for @CAPS6 life was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with @PERSON1. How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing @CAPS6 eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in @PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him @CAPS8 dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me.” @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said @PERSON1 come here “@PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said ‘thank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister I love you man.” That is the time in @CAPS6 life I had to be patience to see @CAPS6 brother. I didn’t care how he looked as long as he is ok.
1	16	17	I’ve been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before, my family and I went about a year ago. Their were so many rides! we were astounded of how many people were  their. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the “ @CAPS2 trap”, “@CAPS3 star”,. Also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and  I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the “@CAPS4 timbers.” The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn’t want to wait long. She said “you need patience”  I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said “mom that patience really paid off”.
5	16	11	I can’t really tell you about a time when I’ve been patient because that something I struggle with no matter how hard I try to be patient it just seems to be impossible but it’s not, maybe. I just don’t try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is I’m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I won’t save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it don’t want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words.
1	16	17	Every day I have to be patient, acctualy every one has to be patient. But have you ever been patient for a sibling? If so then you know how I felt when my sister didn’t want to go out side out of her own self wanting reasons. The other day I was trying to get my sister to go out side with me because we have a special willow tree that we bang out of any way, I was getting off topic, since she kept refusing to get out and exercise I had to result to telling my mother, you can image a she didn’t, my sister brought a book, we assign and then? We got to a??? Way??? Middle of my neighbor hood and we went separate way, I, of course, didn’t??? this and had to waste as a friends house ??? have until she realized a want going to follow her. So I‘ve been annoyed with patience, but?? ?here told it’s a vertue so a guess??? O.k. with that.
3	10	13	Patience is about waiting for some thing. Like we can say your new shoes will becoming in two weeks instead of paceing around worrying all the time. you just walk around like honnel. For example hunting you sit and wait for a deer to come. If your inpatient you would go look for some. Sometimes a lot of people can got inpatient about something and become mean. Being patient is understanding why it is taking a long time for something. You have to to herdteif it dont come the come the @DATE1 it supposed to. This one tim I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. And we never got mad just a little board. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad didnt  come home until the @DATE1
2	10	12	Patientce is hard for example when you walk in to a @CAPS1’s office you must patiently wait your turn to see the @CAPS1. Patience is just another word for “wait” you have to be wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you “@CAPS2 wait to see the @CAPS1. Patience is hard for some people. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a @CAPS1. another example is “@CAPS3” when familys go on a road trip you here @CAPS3 say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience. Whats so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patience”? I would say “wait” wait your turn, ??? for the dos, wait for the @CAPS1, and wait for us to get there.
0	17	17	One day my family and I all went to @CAPS1 point. I was so excited. When we arrived I rushed out the car. We got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on. We were gonna go on the @CAPS2 dragon there was such a long line. It felt like wasn’t even moving. I was as patient as can be. I was so excited to try this ride the family finaly moved up bup bup finally!!! We were next. We all got in our seats and made sure we were backled in nice and tight. The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long it was worth the wait. That was the time is was patient.
0	16	16	Every year me and my entire family take a trip to @LOCATION2 to the @LOCATION1 beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad,(???). my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has @NUM1 bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year.

1	18	17	A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we where waiting I keep asking my mom ""when are we going when are we going."" When the said ""@CAPS1"" i waked into the room. I asked if i was going to hurt and they said you won't fell a thing."" The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath. with out even knowing I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said ""no, no, no"" so I sat and sat until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out I was all loope and had to be put in a wheel chair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me wresteler. When we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for  ever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off. during the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day cause of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat I was happy. I am still patient cause the doctor said that grawn up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get bcacies which is gonna hurt really bad.
3	13	10	A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There is multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach your mind has to be patient when you wish you do things but you really can`t. your body has to be patient when it feels like your ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have.
2	21	19	I have exprienced patients when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, we were in a small car and we were a little caradable because we didn’t sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game we were still pretty bored. All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was considtrated on the road, mom finally and license plates to see travelers. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didn’t stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotels front desk shut down. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed.
5	14	9	When I was patient I was in a store buying something and it was a long line so I had to wait to pay for my stuff I whas I was buying. I waited and the person in front of me had a big cart of food and everything else so I had to be patient when he was up after I had to wait for all of the people to get done paying food their food and anything else.
1	16	17	This is the time when I was patient to my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn’t liking the @CAPS1 than she said “she was scared” of rollercoasters, but I told her it wont be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival, came I was exsited so was @PERSON1, as we got there she was really scared to go on the on therides,so I told her we could go on the smallest ride. After we went oh a few she wasn’t scared as much. Than wall, we were walking she saw a ride, one of the bigest rides there, she said we should go on that so than I told her if she wonted to I we could go on it, and she was sure, after that ride we kept going on differnt bigger rides, wall we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary that was the time I had patience for a friend.
0	17	17	I @DATE1, my family took a trip to @ORGANIZATION1. After @CAPS3 got to the airport @CAPS3 had to wait a long time. So  there @CAPS3 are on the airport, about to leave to go to @LOCATION1 when are flight is delayed because a early morning thunderstorm rolled in. @CAPS6 took forever, every minute seemed like an hour, @CAPS1 after  half an hour I asked for some money to get some breakfast but of course my mom said, “@CAPS2.” I was about to lose @CAPS6 when this guy came over the speaker, “@CAPS3 will have to delay the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 a little longer.” @CAPS4 when I rember that I have a @CAPS5 in my bag and I go to turn @CAPS6 on and @CAPS6’s dead. Then after an hour the storm stopped and @CAPS3 were able to board the plane. From that day I found out I’m not a pacient person.
2	20	18	I was in class waiting  I new that it would come soon. The time was almost here, but I was still waiting for the first class to yet over. Which was math. Personally I didn't like math all that much so unfortunately l had to wait. @NUM1 more minutes and l was home free. The time had come and l was happy. @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 your folder away"" @CAPS2! I @CAPS1 it away faster than I can say supercal fraja list expeal & docinus. So then in his voice he said ""You @MONTH1 go to lunch"" I hurried and I was going to be the first one there I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but l was. I booked it there home free. When l relized a figure in front of me. ""no"" l said. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastaded that is my story and I'm stick to it.

2	17	19	Two summers ago I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my @NUM2 player. @CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. On the way I looked for licence plates with different states on them. We were half way there so we stopped at a dunkin donuts, @CAPS1 was early in the @TIME1, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in. And finally we were in @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights. Then we were on the rode again for @NUM5 hours. to go to @LOCATION1. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And that’s a time  when I was patient
6	22	16	Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end.
0	19	19	I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 . Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad wake me up. He said that they were selling alot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to watiest, and waited in the line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1: And thats a story about a time I have been patient.
6	15	9	When it was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I could not wait for @DATE1 so I open my gifts. My mom and dad give my sister and my second sister and me us. give us money so we can go buy thing that we like. My dad mom and dad and my mom and my mom dad and mom give us money. like my mom and dad dose, and I rember I buy a cute cuformin boots and I could wait to open the boots on @DATE1 and I was @CAPS2 up and down and asking can we open one gife it is @DATE1 @CAPS1 and my mom and dad said no and I got mad. So the next day I wake up on @DATE1 and it was above @NUM1 in the moning and I look in the living room and no one was up so I have to wait until when my patent wake up and I could wait and the time takes forever and that was a tim that I could not wait.
1	13	14	There was a time when I was patience and I was waiting for a long time me my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we was looking for silly bans ok first we went to the @DATE1 store but when we got there they was closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they was on bikes and we walk so then @CAPS1 said it’s a @PERSON2 store down there so walk down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and see how much they casy and they coats @MONEY1 and some of them coat @MONEY2 so we went to @PERSON2 tree and they was a @MONEY3 but we didn’t get them because @PERSON1 didn’t like the ones they had so we went all over the when we found them she didn’t want them. So we went to my grandma house and she asked me where we was all day and I said we was out looking for some dom silly bans. And my grandma said don’t go where @PERSON1 want to go. If your mama tell you to come over here come over here and I was trying to be patience by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1.
1	13	12	Once there was a lonely puppy. One day he sent letter to a random address and waited and waited and waited. A few weeks later he got a reply to his letter, it was from another puppy! They soon became best friends and the puppy learned that patients pays off (ussaly). The @CAPS1
9	19	10	A time when I patient was during last @DATE1. My friends and I were waiting in line to get an autograph of the detrnit tigers @NUM1 baseman @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was going to be exiting to meet the players???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????then left. This was a day when I was patient.
3	9	12	This is a story about one time I when my mom was patient. One time me and my mom was at the clinic ?? to get my medicin. We where one of the first people there. Then a lot more people started to come. My mom thought we where the first people to get called we weren’t @NUM1 groups where called then @NUM1 more groups got called. @NUM3 more groups got called. Then me and my mom finally got called and that was story of the time when my mom was patient.
1	16	17	I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I’ve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine o’clock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn’t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.
1	16	15	One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldn’t wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and saying” I’m for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like mom” and that’s about the handreth time I said that to her and she said “ you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that he’s going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didn’t care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days I’m being patient I really can’t believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when I’m getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so I’m really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days I’ve been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I don’t have to be patient no more, the end
2	7	5	In my own words patience is when you have to just be com and quiet. And not all hyper and annoying. Patience is just controling yourself. And not being all rude and disrespectful to others.
3	9	12	I was patient on the trip to @LOCATION1 it took two days to get down there I got hungery and had to go to the bathroom when ever I was hungery I had to what until next stop when we got gas so when it was on full I had to be patient with out complaining. So, I had to be patient until the gas tank was empty that’s when we got gas and I could eat something or I had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right hand or a test area because the have a vending machine there and bathrooms there too. On the right hand side because we can get off on get back on the high way. That’s when I had to be patient.
2	14	12	One day when I was going to @LOCATION1  we drove for @NUM1 whole day because we went in the wrong direaction and my mom got made at night we were trying to find a hotel about @NUM1:30am I was the only one aware because my three brothers @PERSON1, @LOCATION2, caman were sleping in the back of the van my sister @CAPS1 and me were in the front and I got really angry because a guy. Look the last room they had but I was really angry patient and really we a room the next day we went to the @ORGANIZATION1 to stay we were going to the water park/musment park there was a new ride"" the scoping tail butt we had to wait for @NUM1 hour to go on that ride and I was really patient but my mom was getting tired and mad because  it took so long then the next day it rained and rained so we went to the indoor fool at our hotel but we couldnt go in because there were in many people so we had to wait but I wasnt patient because I wanted to go swimming  the almost a halve hour we got to go swimming then the next day we had to leave and this time it took almost two days to get us back home the time & we got there was at @TIME1 I was patient enough to help my parents get all the stuff in our house then we finally got to go to bed I was so happy.
4	9	5	I was patient when my mom when to the doctors and she was having a baby and I had to wait in the waiting room for @NUM1 hour for ???.
0	16	16	Someone was in line for hot & ready pizza since they are hot and ready, a lot of people were in line and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza is supposed to hot and ready. Everybody was throwing tanruns. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tanrums. The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they don`t want to hear you so you had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn`t bother to speak. Everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast.  Always be patient.
4	20	24	“@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?” I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes .One of these, I hoped was the letter. “@CAPS2 yet honey ,” she said “but there’s plenty of bills to go around.”  I wanted  to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said ,”  just wait long  enough and you’ll get what you want”  I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesn’t sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results .Pretty good system ,huh? No ! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!
2	21	19	Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little it’s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn’t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3.
0	10	10	My mom was pation because when I came home late from the park she was be pation, but she wasn’t pation when she took the phone away from me she wasn’t pation. When my brother get he has pations for him and my sister but none for me. Just because I came home @NUM1 minutes late, she said she had pations before I did that and now she has a little bit of pations for me just a little.
0	24	24	Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1’t control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “@CAPS1 I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!
1	18	17	There were many of times when I was patient. There was a time when I was patient for a whole month. I was getting a new basketball video game , but it didn’t come out until a mother mounth. So I had to be patient. I could not wait until the game came out. It seemed like it took forever. It was the day befor the game came out and I lost my money that I was going to use to get the game. So then I had to save up @NUM1 more dolllers to buy the game that nI wanted.  I had to get two @DATE1 jobs so that can help me make the money that I lost . so two weeks past by then I went to the game store so I can buy the game. When I walked In the store, the manager told me there are no more copy’s of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole nother @NUM2 weeks, and I get very mad. So I wated @NUM2 weeks for the game and I finaly got the game. I was so mad I had to be  patient that long but I got what it was wroth. So that is my story about being patient.
3	17	14	I was patient when I was in school when my teacher left the room. The kids started going crazy and they were standing on tables. Throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper in the @ORGANIZATION1. The kids were screaming and I was just sitting there waching as the teacher comes in and sees what is happening. I am just sitting there as I am amazd how stuiped they are acting. Then I am waching them get in trouble and get calls home. I am thinking good thing I was not part of it because I might get kicked from the cross country team. The kids are getting suspened for lunch. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness  thet can get the kids in even more troubley.
1	17	16	About @NUM1 weeks ago I order a look series at border online, I had to be very patient so it would feel like @NUM2 year of waiting. This book series was not like any book series @CAPS1 books are my favorite book they’re call the @LOCATION1 series. I have read the series @NUM1 times and I am still reading them. But, I had to wate to get them. I trying to patient, but it was hard. The mailing date said in less than @NUM4 hour. I had to wate for @NUM5 day before it a came, When I forget about them they come! Being patient is a good qulatie people can have. So if your  patient you will probably get what you want.
4	24	20	Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!
2	19	17	A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day she when I woke up I woke up to early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I got ready at @NUM1 am. So at @NUM2 am I called her but she didn’t answer. So then I just was watching, tv and playing my game. Then around @NUM3 pm my aunt called back sayin she had to go to the store. so now my fusteration started to build up. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you goin and how long your gonna be gone. but I was trying to be patient. Now at @NUM4 my mom said lets go! Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom. So me and my mom got home at around @NUM5 pm. Now I was real angry because she had not even called since we was gone. So I called her and she said she comin down the street. I was so happy so later on that day I had fun with my couisins and aunt.
2	18	16	I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patient. I had to use patients when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didn’t I would have been really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. I t took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patients so the system could be delivered. Patients is a very needy thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patients.
2	18	20	There was a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go so his family went. It had opened @NUM1 minutes ago. They didn’t think there was going to be a line. They got there and they didn’t see any cars in the drive thru. They went through the drive through which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they say about @NUM2 cars. He was really mad. They were about to leave and then there were @NUM3 cars behind them, so they stayed in line. Since it was a new restraunt everyone was picking their food very slowely. They where also making the food very slowely. Then people started yelling, “@CAPS1 up,” they where also honking their horns but he was the only who wasn’t honking his horn. They where waiting for @NUM2 minutes and @NUM1 had gone @CAPS3. He was starving and he still was being very patient. He usually is not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restraunt.  When it was his turn the cashier said, “@CAPS2 you for being very patient.” @CAPS3 the time they got their food it took @NUM6 hour. The food wasn’t even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didn’t honk his car horn and he wasn’t yelling. He had stayed in the car @NUM6 hour and he was starving. It is a great thing to have patience.
1	14	13	So you want a story about being patient well your in lack. So the story starts off with me at the doctor’s office so I’m waiting. I was going to sit here for a few hours so so @NUM1 @CAPS1 I’ll read something. So I’m reading and all I here is wineing oho screaming so I ??? ono yes. But not mad. I get the kid to stop crying and mom to stop screaming, so I was happy. There my sister cheris comes up and screams in my ear I was really annoyed but not mad so I just got another ??? then my mom says it’ll be another hour. I was so mad I screamed. This is true and I was pre patient
5	14	19	There are many time @CAPS1 a persons life when someone was being patient. Patient @CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @CAPS1 a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it.
2	22	20	@CAPS1 was a beautifal morning, sky was blue, birds were singing, and my sister was going skydiving. Her and her boyfriend zone, were playing to go sky diving so me, my friend,, and my parents taged along to watch. We had a couple people in front of them so we had to wait for an hour or so. Then another hour passes. Still not even close to being there turn. We were starting to get hungrey so we went into town and order some breakfast, we got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancle our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, still not there turn. I don't really know how but something happened to wide we had sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally there turn, they got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while and then @CAPS1 looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, then another followed. They sailed down to a succes. @CAPS1 turns out that we sat there for eight hours befor they jumped. Not including the hour and a half drive there .I think that I was pretty patient that day.
4	13	9	Every day I have this kid sit by me on the bus. He is annoying every day but I listen to him anyway. We usely et a long but we debated about things sometime. He tells out rages story about @CAPS1 and snipers. He’s not really my friend but he come one to talk to. I think if I listen and talk to this kid is a god sent mission because he doesn’t have many friends.
3	22	19	I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!
1	16	15	I remmeber a time when I was six I was waiting In the walking clinil @CAPS1 almost @NUM1 hours so l asked them if  they could change the @LOCATION1 channel  to @ORGANIZATION1, after  @CAPS2 got over I @CAPS3 asleep @CAPS2 @CAPS5 like forever @CAPS1 them to say ''@CAPS6 salslory,"" my mom tried wakeing me up she couldn't until I @CAPS7 off the cach seat that they had In the kid's are. I was there at the walking clinic @CAPS1 one reason my athsmua @CAPS2 bad @CAPS1 a while because I'd been sick. Whe  they called me dawm my mom said that I was really patient and the nurse evan  said I was actually Patient to be patient that long so she gave me a lolly pop, (small one). After all of that was done I went home and went to bed. Thats the time I was Patient @CAPS1 two hours.
1	14	13	One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient
1	9	10	I will tell you about when I was patience. For a long time it was hope you will read. I was going to @LOCATION1 to go quisney world .It to ke forever! It toke  three days of driving. We play game like I spy or game boy. We very rare toke break for peeing or eating. I will didn’t lik the trip. But when we finally got there it was worth it. We had some fun.
2	14	16	A lime when I was patient was last year every day I had to be patient, because of my aunt. last year my aunt would pick me up in the back of the school someday I didn’t know if she was picking me up, like this one time it was the first day of school and I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know who was going to pick me up. I didn’t have a phone so I couldn’t call mane. There I was waiting being patience at the school. As I was waiting I with my friend to his house, then I went back to the school and waited. For about @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes or what felt about an hour my aunt came and picked me up.
6	15	9	One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in ann- @CAPS1  and the was a lot of traffic and me my sister and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting for @NUM1 hours) I was really unhappy so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down. I found out I was late so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow.
3	18	15	Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn’t be able to wait that long.
2	7	9	Where was a time that I was patient dad getting my first silly hamster. And patient is that you are understanding and tolerant. I very patient and happy to get my first hamster. And I got my first ??? hamster. And I got two of them. And they are silly and they bite. And my brother was patience to get his ???. And patience is that you relzed want to see bad that you and on fired to get the thing that you want.
8	24	16	Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was @NUM3 oclock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to @CAPS2. So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4°@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!
2	21	19	Aplause  filled the building after the first dance ended. I was back stage with my dance team going over routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crouded and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. “@CAPS1 many more dances?” and “what dance are we on?” @CAPS2 what everyone had on there mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on excited bored and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting  that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience!
5	23	18	One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient.
3	8	5	I am going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is about waiting. For example “you were very patience in line for cotton candy”, said the clown. You know something like that I know this a short story, I’m sorry.
1	16	15	A time when I was pacient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too.
2	22	20	Patient help you got through life. If You aren't patient then you won't know where to go next in the future. @CAPS4 uncle had to be patient face month. He was running a muck just @CAPS5 for a phone call. Finally someone yelled just be patient they will call. He bid  us being patient is the hardest thing he was to do. He was dined why they couldn't call the next day. He said ended up forgetting about  here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. @CAPS4 under was waiting for a patient ??? America's next  @CAPS1 @CAPS2. They add him they would call if he got in. They soon did  because the phone mug. A woman nicely said ""@MONTH1 I speak with @CAPS3 sanders please"" @CAPS4 uncle replied ""yes this is him! I  @CAPS5 for a month! @CAPS4 family kept telling me to be patient! So now I don't have up anymore!"" "" You are in! so keep on practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!"" "" @CAPS6 you so much!""then he hung upon the phone "" I'm in!"" @CAPS7 was the happiest days of our lives. @CAPS4 uncle with through a lot. Really all that kept him on the ground was him being patient. He told us @CAPS7 was hard but @CAPS7 worked out great and the ending. Here's future advice. Always and I mean always be patient. Your not going to get anywhere in your life if you aren't . Patient is an important @CAPS8 of your life.
3	13	16	A time when I was patient was when @DATE1 we drove to @LOCATION1. It was a long ride. It was long because he had a nagshion that went the long way to six flag and to our hotel. I try not to complan and be patient because the ride was a daylong so that means sitting for almost a day! We were lost in @LOCATION1 for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cusion that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I hade to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning and I was tird. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking for ever! At the hotel I was unpacking my stuff and notice I was patient for almost a day which I though I would never be able to do in a car. That was the time I was being patient.
6	15	9	I time I was patient is when we had to do mcap teats. I was one of the first ones done so I had to sit quitly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for evrey one to finish. it was vary long time to read. I got board but I sat quite so people could finish, and so I wouldent be disrptintt. Thean when evry one finshed we took a batheroom brack.
1	12	13	Every day I must be patient in difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weaken my brother play in a play football league and it can bewaring. I have to bit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wat in the game. My favorite speed is football and since I am a first base man and an eat fields; I have to wait of the ball to ??? so that  I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is a long so and I must wait until people are we done. As you can see, I am very patient are have to be in many situations.
3	16	13	One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thougt that everything he wanted would come to him right a way. His name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 soon reliesed that not everything came right when he wanted it. So he got really mad when he saw a house for sale, it was a really nice house. But the people living in the house weren’t done moving everything out of the house. Then he discovered that patience is key and that when it’s time to move in he will. So from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life.
1	17	18	I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady havent called my name yet, after waiting like @NUM1 minutes. I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine.  Before I knew it @CAPS2 called my name, “@CAPS1” @CAPS2 said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself “maybe being patient isn’t that bad after all!”
2	16	14	I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my room I she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. It was so oganizing. For example, I kept paceing back and forth but then I just sat down. After an hour of patientience, my mom and grandma said goodbye and hung up the phone and I finally got my breakfast.
4	15	11	I remember a time when I was @CAPS1 I was at home it was chritmas time The first one up and I just wanted to open all of my presents and gift but I had to wait till every one got down stairs and @CAPS2 mom to get the camera @CAPS2 we open present my brother and sister whant first be?? The oldest go first a rule my brother made up then finally it was my turn I just randomly took the present and ripped the paper of not even looking at the present because it was my turn I had been @CAPS1 all this time that was the time when I was a @CAPS1.
2	12	10	Before,when i had to go to the doctor, I had  to wait fourty minutes. So i just played my @CAPS1. I was playing  mario cart.I got board so i just fell asleep. My mom woke me up because it was time. So we went in did my apointment and went home. Then we had to wait twenty minuts for my dad to get home from work.
0	17	17	A time when I was patient was when I ordered a @CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1, and I was ordering a @CAPS1 online. When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said @NUM1 weeks.”@CAPS3?!”I exclaimed.”That’s a long time.”@CAPS4 it was decided. I had to make through @NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 I saw a @CAPS1. The address said “@CAPS6 @CAPS7”! I was @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you’ll get @CAPS3 yar wanting in the end.
1	23	24	A long wait   @CAPS1 ‘only four’ at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn’t care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea but I didn’t love it either. Of course. It didn’t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I don’t get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I’ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can’t wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !
3	9	12	The time iwas patent was when I was in schol I was in math and I waswoting to setant so i could go to my friends @ORGANIZATION1 so I was waiting and whatins and whatins and watins and whatins @CAPS1 the clock was not tennin so starten doins my class work and @CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION2 rang I was @CAPS3 agen @CAPS1 thare is one @CAPS5 @CAPS1 it was not a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cons we hade the meap so it was only a @CAPS9 @CAPS10 in all classes so we only @CAPS11 @NUM1 minits left till the time moms out so i @CAPS12  some want and @NUM2 minits past and then me and m fend.

1	16	17	A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldn’t wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandma’s cottage I didn’t complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient don’t go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person.
0	20	20	@PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking her @CAPS1 for a while now. Every time she would ask her @CAPS1, would reply â€œYou canâ€™t get a dog until you earn it.â€ @PERSON1 didnâ€™t know how @CAPS7 earn it, she thought about it for a while she didnâ€™t really know what her @CAPS1 meant, she figured that her @CAPS1 meant that she needed @CAPS7 @CAPS8 her some responsibility. She looked at the clock it said @NUM1, almost time for dinner, she thought her @CAPS1 was probably, working on it, so she walked out @CAPS7 the kitchen & there was her @CAPS1 making dinner. @PERSON1 asked a little more than loud â€œwhatâ€™s for dinner?â€  steak & mashed potatoes. That was @PERSON1â€™s favorite. She nodded & said â€œcanâ€™t help!â€ â€œwhy not?â€ her @CAPS1 questioned. @PERSON1 asked her what could she could do & her @CAPS1 said @CAPS7 get the salt & pepper @CAPS7 put on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 felt pretty happy that @PERSON1 was willing @CAPS7 help out. @PERSON1 did what she could then went upstairs @CAPS7 her room, she was hoping her @CAPS1 would get the message. She ate dinner with her @CAPS1 then she went @CAPS7 bed. The next day she ran down the stairs @CAPS7 find her @CAPS1 sitting on the coach. She said quickly â€œwhat are we doing today?â€ her @CAPS1 answered â€œI was thinking we could just hang around the house.â€ @PERSON1 was getting impatient she wanted a dog & she was trying her @CAPS6 @CAPS7 be good, then finally she last it and shouted â€œare we ever gonna get a dog???â€ her @CAPS1 surprised of @PERSON1 said â€œwellâ€¦â€¦â€ @PERSON1 interrupted â€œ@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ONE AND I @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU! â€œher @CAPS1 answered well if you were more patiet I was gonna say maybe we could go look at anneâ€ @PERSON1 felt bad for veiling & realised things will turn out better if she wailse later that day her & her @CAPS1 went and out a day.
0	19	19	A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in @LOCATION1. My @CAPS1, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point. My @CAPS1’s stayed at the motorhome while my @CAPS1, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller coasters, my @CAPS1 by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my @CAPS1 were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just on??? before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have @CAPS2, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still, I had to try very hard but eventraully I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing.
1	8	7	Patience is used when people are not in a hurry to gett were they are going. Like checking out at a store or at work, some people can be rood and not use their patience at school and work you should always use your patience, like for an example, use my patience at kinchat school because there are over one handred @NUM1, graders, and half of them are bushy when its lunch time and the other half gets hurt and they @CAPS1 don’t know what to do.
1	12	13	When I got bit by a dog I was in @LOCATION1 when it happened. The dog jumped up and bit me in my face. So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to @ORGANIZATION1 a hospitly in @LOCATION1. They hade me sitting in a hospitle bed for @NUM1 hours. Then I got shiped to hurly.

And when she whent to the doctors for a “cheak-up” it turned out she had heart disease @NUM1 main artary block ages. So I had to wait while she was getting  “preped”. It took two hours which felt like forever! Then I got to see her for five minutes then she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magizens. I was very worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day. That was the time I had patients and it payed off.
6	16	10	The time I was patience was when I was @NUM1 years old when I was @NUM1 years old my mom said I had to go to the dentist @DATE2 it was @DATE1 so @DATE2 it was @DATE1 so @DATE2 my mom waked me up then I said yes I’m going to sleep she said wake up its time for you to go to the dentist I popped up in and started screaming she was like be quiet because other people in this house is tring to go to sleep I said ok mom she was like go grab you some clothes I like ok so when we had both put on some clothes I was just saying stuff I was like I’m going to the dentist to get some stickers I just keep saying that so when she pulled up in she parking bf I stopped in and said we here then she parked the car I opened the door in then she parked the car.

1	8	7	I was patient last year when I was when I was taking the ??? and it was not done. I hate being patient and when I do it is boring. Patients seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting head akes and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking to much. And that is why I don’t like being patient.
3	19	16	One day my grandfather and I went fishing my grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, “that will take far ever just catch some fish.” I told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something pulling at my fishing rod I taint to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it weren’t a turtle. After I caught that fish I said it’s time for a break time. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish. At the time I was finshing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling.  I had to grab my fishing rod and ??? in my fish but it weren’t a fish it was a baby turtle.

So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines all I have to do is be a lot more patient and dont complaine.

4	20	16	Have you ever have to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at a theain park? Have you ever wait until all your chores are done before you can play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell you about one time that I had to be patient. During @DATE1 I had to go to the doctor to get shots @CAPS2 that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was @CAPS2 boring! And I was thinking, “@CAPS1 long does it take for a few people to get shots @CAPS2 that I can leave?” @CAPS2 I had to just sit there for about half- an- hour until my name was called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is once of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend. I hope you liked it.
3	9	6	When my friend was getting his meds I waited until he got ready, I was seating to wait for him. I was getting my phone down loud @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift. I was looking for @PERSON1 and I was waiting for him to be done.

My mom just ??? go to the oven for @NUM1 minets! I did not want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take there shape of big, dark brown, round, and soft my mougnt wasted I wanted them now. The timer buzed @CAPS1 over there, grabed a hot pad and almost through them out of the oven! Right as I was about to get one my mom snarped “they need to cool in on”. She set the timer for @NUM2 minets! I did not think I could wait that long. My magnt waterd at the small. I was dying I wanted them so bad! I thought the smell could kill me! Every minet semed like an houre. Then the timer buzed I sprinted, over ther, grabed a plate tossed @NUM3 of the bigest cookes on the plate, while doing so I burned my hand. But I did not care I took a bite out of a cooke my water was over. My patieates payed off in the end I t was so word in it for the cookes I got.
2	14	16	The time when I showed patient is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in @LOCATION1. I want to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big, you could fit @NUM1 people in it. The time I was patient is when I was going up the stairs to the slide when every body rush in front of me just to go down @NUM2 slide’s. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on fun slide. The blason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flight or stair’s with in ??? So the second time  I went up I ran up the stair’s so I could be the first one, so I did and  I still had to wait because it still people there from last time. So I waited my turn. That is the time I showed patient.

We all woke up the next morning sun shing lights on. So we all walked out to our cars smelling like break & meat. That was the best patient day of my life.
1	13	12	One time I went to cetar point and I was rideing in the car. And we were about @NUM1 hour away from the cetar point park. And I was talking with my sister @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and I fell asleep. And the we were there I was so excited and that I couldn’t wait to go on the @CAPS1.

In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.

So a little while later like a week later I asked him again. He told me give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn’t take it she asked him on @DATE1 and he said yes! A million yes, joy came from his mouth. Then @DATE2, after getting to know me better he broke up with me.

And I was patient for a very long time to.
4	20	24	In sports you always have to be patient. Like if your not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasn’t the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school he frield out for the varsity, but didn’t make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he should’ve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didn’t quit or tell himself that he wasn’t good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3’s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star.
0	16	16	One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up. Then I started getting unpatient. My grandma said “@CAPS1 keep waiting it will come soon”. So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I some new sneakers. Also we all got @NUM1 players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth.
2	14	16	Do you have patience? Well if you she a your like we. But I now in guy that ???  patience his name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M holols the secret of patience what helps him a lot is he about talk much ??? ??? ?much like one time we were at cedes.

But @CAPS2 isn't prefect when heh hurgry he has no patience and I have in file a why. The one time @CAPS2 showed the must patience was ?? his moms car broke down in the suddle  of ?? And @CAPS4 was wintel out so the car was cold @CAPS4 took nine hours for a four kuck get struck and that threw his mom over the ?? but not him until ??? when he got finally but ??? had a nice mean @PERSON1 them out and they went to @ORGANIZATION1 lets to get food. @CAPS2 has the most patience I've ever seem someone have.
1	13	12	It time when I was patience was when I went to a pair and we had to wait in line for like two hours. I was bored just standing there but I really want to go on rides and that’s what was waiting in line for. I was trying to be patience the hole time in line so I could get my @CAPS1?? on go on ride because I hated just standing there the whole time my feet started to hurt the heavy bad because I was ??? ??? there I finally got to the front of the line to get my ticket I was so happy and that was a time when I was patient.
1	18	19	One time when I was patient was when me and my family, went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1.  Once we got on the boat it took @NUM1 minutes to go through the river. Then at @NUM2 we just waited, trolling through the water. Rocking side to side like a baby in its crib. Setting up all the poles and tures. Then around @NUM3 we got our first hit. My dad rushed over to get the pole and started reaching as fast as he could. Eventually he got it in it was a, @ORGANIZATION1 at @MONEY1. Then around @NUM4, another pole got a hit I rushed over grabbed the pole and started realing it in. With some help my fish turned out to be a king @ORGANIZATION1 that came in at @NUM5. and @NUM6 inches tall. That is why it always helps to be patient. You never know  what’s  going to happen if you are patient.
1	8	7	When you have patience you are colmer peace full and happy. It is like when you  birth day is next week and you don’t want to wait for it and have to get mad be cases you want your presents today not next week. But you can’t so you get mad start to hit things and than you don’t get a good behaver. Then you make your parents made then they bring some of you gifts back to they store that is not patience. That is non patience when you get mad becomes   you can’t get what you want.
2	16	18	A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the destroyer’s. So in all the game’s I always had to wait to the @DATE2. So in the @DATE1 game of the season I got in four times. In the first @DATE2 I got in for about one minute. the I got in for @NUM1 minutes in the @DATE1’s. I was happy but I still wasn’t starting. then we got into the play off’s I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamate’s came up to me and said don’t worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few month’s I waited patiently. Then we got in tournament’s then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoff’s then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient.
1	15	16	A kid in my school, @PERSON1, has had a crush on my best friend my coarse for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy obsessed.In fact she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago, sorry of topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient, hoping mycaela will come around someday. It’s been almost two years with him stalking her and she still hasn’t come around. I just think that @PERSON1 is very patience and be is a great kid.
0	16	16	One time was the often best friend I had went to a ride it was so hot outside but the first ride we on was called the @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going  through a maze because how the rope were tied up we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours . But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how . When we sat down in the rollar coaster it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for.
1	14	15	Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don’t also ??? Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get in the bus stop @NUM1 min early, so I can talk with my mother ??? Try I got up to early. I made it to the bus stop early. ??? @NUM2 min later I decided to go back home. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried at the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have more patient. On day I was going to burger ??? was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got their, their where about @NUM3 peace in their, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had later. I was there people payed from cash regester. I was finally their I ordered my burger when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient.
1	16	15	One time I went to the doctors. The docter said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said a nother docter will come in. we waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. The docter that was spose to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. In conclusion. I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the docters so patience always has a reward.
1	15	16	I’m really not a patient person but one day last. Years at the end of the school year. My older sister @PERSON2 was having a baby. And I wanted to go because that was my first nephew.

Right now he is six months old and I love when I see him.   And when he is older he will no that   I was the whole time waiting for him to be born. Love  @PERSON1.

2	14	16	When I had to go get my check up with my asma or and a familiar way like that when I had been waiting in the waiting room wich had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn’t call your name yet. So I had gotton myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes wich were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader at the same time a writer but I mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name but I was still busy doing activities then he had said he was sorry a bout  the wait which took a while and just said it had been fine and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me fell really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or sitters. But to me it doesn’t matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience.
3	8	11	Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be hard or stresful. If you are waiting to get a shot or life threat results. A way to avoid normal patience like being board is to get some notes or school work to do or an ipod. Patience is everywere. For example carrides, birthday parties, vacation commercial, school being over, restaurants, holidays or whenever you say “I cannot wait,” and etc. to sam up a few ways about patience in my way of description.
3	15	12	A  time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister , my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1. I was getting my hair cut by a official barbor. I waited all the way to @NUM2 to get my hair cut. That was a time I was patient
1	14	13	I am patient wherever I go to the dentist’s office, orthodontist, or doctor’s office. The first time is at the dentist’s office when I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and end magazines .The next place I am patient is outhodontist,I sit and wait in the first room and crater to my I-pod after a few minutes the call me into the second room where I wait little longer to get my bracer frightened . Once I get in the office I have to wait for the guy to tighter them. Finally there is the doctor’s office where you sit in the big waiting foom for a long time and wait for the lady to call you in when you get there if you are getting shuts you have to wait patienty for the doctor to being them. As can see a lot of things take patience.
4	20	24	On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe.
1	7	8	One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game I had wait a while so went to my friends last of sitting and watching I am never patient when theres food involved I don’t like to wait for my food it sucks when I have to wait. I don’t know any other time I was patient I don’t like to be patient.
1	23	22	It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind. It had snowed the @TIME1 but it was only @DATE1. Then again I was in the upper penisaala of @LOCATION1. I was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun could kill a dear @NUM2 yards. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a day. I’ve only seen a squarile and he was fun to watch in all but not the rush you get when you see a deer. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I was looking in the direction the sound was coming. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” gun up @TIME2 time my adrenilen hicking in. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I see move ment put my scope on it and I see it. It’s a it’s a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was @NUM3. time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and “@CAPS4!” perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he was big @NUM5. I got him mounted and that’s were he is now.
3	12	9	One time I wanted this awesome @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 it looked great so I asked my mom and she said we and it tommow so I waited and waited. I was very patient but I started to get alittle irritated cause it was taking so long. I was kind of getting impateint, I didnt complain though but I still want that @CAPS3 to this day im just have to be patient.
4	10	6	My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something. You have to wait until they done. An if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude.
1	16	15	The time I was….One after school I was walking home with my friends from school. @CAPS3 knowing me I wanted something to eat @CAPS3 I told my friends to come in @LOCATION1’s rest (it’s a fast food restaurant.) @CAPS1 we walk in @LOCATION1’s ,the place is crowded @CAPS3 I waited in line after about @NUM1 minutes my friends said “@CAPS2  man let’s go”  @CAPS3 I say “I’ll  meet you guys outside “ “alright” they said. A bout @NUM2 minites later it was my turn to order and I order a double stack and some fries and I got free milkshake for my patience  she asked what kind did @CAPS4 I said strawberry and I didn’t had to pay for ??? was totally free and I went outside and a told my friends I got this for free and then they said “oooooooh”, that’s when we went home.
1	21	20	Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for @CAPS1 city, I @CAPS2't contain myself. I was already packed up but mom and dad were standing. ""@CAPS3 you please finish packing see I really want to go! "", I exclaimed ""You'll just have to wait a minute, ""Do ?? But I @CAPS2't wait, so I grabed??, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. After they finished cooking dad was carrying the last of the bags @CAPS4 their bedroom to the complain he notice me, setting patiently at the look. He thanked me, saying ""@CAPS5 for being so patient, and just for that, mom and have surprise. For you. He set down the sultans, and briskly walked over to a white plastic had the suddenly pulled at a rectangular favor it was the some in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7?????? it wash ? you????????. Kind you so much man     ? Replied. This just goes to show that prince really says off. Only if you don't complain of course. !
1	11	10	one time I was in  patient. We was an are way to see the point. The had family was with us. We all was in @NUM1 car and vans. I was like and the van @NUM2 and the car and @NUM3 in the car.  It was like a @NUM3 hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We was and takere for like a hour. First I was on the fane then I was just having a family talk bye like an hour I was so in patient. And all I could here was my mom like be patient we gone get there. I’m like no no I want to be there @CAPS1. She like we got all day. Then we stop to get something to eat. Then we was there.
5	18	13	I’m going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. Also my mama had to go to other places to. First, we went to costland mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to shoe depot get me some shoe. Third, I went to go get my hair done. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G this whole day you have been patient. I couldn’t do that.
3	13	16	@CAPS6 was @NUM1 at night, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for @CAPS1 the next day. I couldnâ€™t go to sleep at all, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyoneâ€™s sprit @CAPS6 is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you.sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider)  for @CAPS1 I am patient with others others  because I would like for them to be patient with me as well. Treat others how you would like to be treated. I think @CAPS1 is the most joyful time of the year, donâ€™t you? @CAPS6 is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer well, that is my patience response. Thank you for your time @CAPS9
3	16	13	Un Patience @CAPS1.   My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that’s when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.
3	23	20	A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn’t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn’t get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don’t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them.
3	19	16	One time I was very patient. We were on a train going to @LOCATION1. I didn't have my game or music player. It fit live it would never spend, @CAPS2 I didn't complane.I sat in the seat for what felt like forever. Then when we got off the train I said ""@CAPS1. I'm done.""@CAPS2 then there was the bus ride to the musem of science one histry. Not as in thout to myself. Once agin stop after stop we went. Untill finally we got their. It was amazing, there were tons of interesting things like amiten that made tops or @CAPS3. @CAPS2 then patience are ?? when we went to the history. It was the train allover agin. Dad had to see everything and anything ??? Then we had to take the bus back to the train. Next the trained agin. @CAPS2 this time I had a top by that got boring so I still didn't complain. @CAPS2 dad said it has to long and I would be able to bring my os next time. That is my example of pacience.
8	24	16	@CAPS2 father has recently lost his job. It has been hard. It has exactly @NUM1 since @CAPS2 father has had job. @CAPS2 father has been constantly applying for jobs. But he didn't give up. He kept on trying and trying. Fortunately @CAPS2 father has a job interview in san @CAPS1 in a couple of weeks he is going. Hopefully he will get the job.  Thankfully @CAPS2 father has been very patient. Even though he is being rejected constantly, he still trys very hard to get a job. @CAPS2 father is @CAPS2 I role model because of his amazing level of patientence. Thank god, I have someone to care for me who his as patient as @CAPS2 father. Without the patience of @CAPS2 father @CAPS2 family could live. Well job or no job I will always love @CAPS2 father. This would be true because of @CAPS2 fathers great level of patience. For that main reason that is why @CAPS2 dad will always be @CAPS2 heroe and number one beloved role model
1	21	20	Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 saftey course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!
2	8	6	I am a very patient person. An example are games. For some games you have to wait weeks, or months. For others you might have to wait years. I have done this before.
1	23	22	Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient.
2	15	13	This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I haven’t had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom. I had confidence that my mom would by me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes.
0	14	14	The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball she’ll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames.
2	11	9	Patience is a kind thing , people being patient, but still complaining about it thats not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while your doing it. People that loose their patience easily really is not cool, its nice when someone waits for you if say your on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something. Its very poliete if you have patience, I don’t know the definition of it but am just gonna guess, I think its a person waiting patiencently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere.
1	19	20	Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three step to being patient, being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient. Being patient
2	16	14	Last year, @DATE1 it was my birthday, so I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3 and out of everything I said “@CAPS1 I want a @CAPS2” (@CAPS3 station @CAPS4). So the @DATE2 we go out at three in the morning to get my @ORGANIZATION1 and we were at best buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over @DATE4 people in the store. So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two text and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at @TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my @CAPS2, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect.
2	16	14	A time when i was patient was at the @NUM1 birthday bash where i used to live i was waiting  in line and the line was like a mile long so i waited and waited and then finally i go to look for my ticket and forget i left it in the car so I had to go all the way back. So then i get back which got twice as big as before then I wait some more it sucked then outta nowhere it starts raining, I dn’t got an umbrellla, I’m still waiiting. How could it get any worse? Well over it did  they shut down the concert. So i went home soaking wet, my feet and hands. So i jus lay go to sleep and relax. P.S worse day of my life.
6	22	16	Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decide to be patient and read. Before I knew it we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.
5	14	9	A time when I was patient was when I was at my dad’s office. We were there for an hour. And be patient until we left. It was not easy being patient. I had to take an entire hour not saying anying. Until my dad told me too.
1	23	24	Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the @CAPS1 bush. @CAPS5 didn’t know why @CAPS5 had to. Her parents second distressed all the time now.” @CAPS2 must be something I did,” @CAPS5 thought. Her sister was not as patient as @CAPS5 was waiting. @CAPS5 had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn’t come and somebody else did @CAPS5 wasn’t happy. Boys came walking along the road @CAPS6 @CAPS14 were hiding carrying @NUM1’s. Melay was thinking, “these are boys waiting along the street. Are @CAPS14 crazy!” @CAPS3 their parents told them to hide @CAPS2 was always for a good reason. @CAPS5 sat @CAPS13 thinking about this when @CAPS5 heard a loud crack! “@CAPS4 was that’s” @CAPS5 thought. @CAPS5 looked to @CAPS6 her sister was supposed to be and @CAPS5 wasn’t @CAPS13.” @CAPS6 was @CAPS5?”  @CAPS7 @CAPS5 looked out to @CAPS6 the boy soldiers were standing around laughing.” @CAPS4 were @CAPS14 laughing at?” @CAPS5 looked closer and saw that @CAPS2 was her sister. “@CAPS10!” @CAPS5 cried out. “@CAPS6 are my parents, @CAPS14 should be here by now,” @CAPS5 thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. Thats when @CAPS5 saw another two married and depleated bodies. @CAPS5 found out that @CAPS2 was her parents. @CAPS5 started running. Running away from tragity. @CAPS5 made @CAPS2 a mile before @CAPS5 had to hide. @CAPS5 hid in a bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly one cried our, “@CAPS13 @CAPS5 is!” @CAPS14 dragged her out of the bush, and walked for @CAPS4 seemed to be forever. Finally @CAPS14 reached a build. Melay was screaming at herself,” @CAPS3 only I waited. @CAPS3 only I waited. @CAPS14 took her into a room and the boss raped her @CAPS14 quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. @CAPS3 only @CAPS5 had waited.
1	9	10	Patience. Wow, you want critism; are you sure? We’ll since you asked for it,  it looks like I’m have to give it to you. Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you’ll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want.so that is my story about patience explained my way.
1	14	13	When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was very busy. We dint have to wait a long time , @CAPS1 my ride we ??? to wait a longtime  to get on @CAPS1 my friend  was very patiente and I was not. I kept complaining on how long it took. @CAPS1 eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, @CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world.
2	18	20	One day when I was home alone I felt nobody was with me. I was home alone because my uncle was very sick and my and parents went to go visit him. I was very scared and I felt @CAPS1 had left me. So I prayed and prayed but I fell or heard nothing back. So I fell asleep and I heard @CAPS2 voice, he was talking to me! I was running in a field will grass. I saw a man dressed in where dating walking through and, and when he came out of the mud there was no sitting or did anymore on him. I ran up to him and asked “man who are you?” he replied and said” little child of @CAPS1 why do you look so lonely? I am your angel one I have come to tell you what your father has said,” he talked to me for a long time, and I did not feel scared or lonely anymore, there was one cloud in the sky, he said he had to go but that he was my gurdian angle. After that he rose into the deol. I will never forget him, he is my angle. And that was the time I needed to have patience to hear @CAPS4 voice.
0	12	12	I was patient when my dog had to go the @CAPS1 he was really sick becaus he had heart worms my mom and I just whated for about two hour's I was not as patint as my mom because I keep asking my mom what was going on. After the operation was down we had to whate even longer intill we got my dog bare back almost @NUM1 hours. After the @CAPS1 called us we went and got my dog and the doctor sed that he had to water in till he could be up and moving and it was finly ok and we played in the snow all @CAPS3 long.
4	20	16	Im @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn’t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that.
3	12	9	The time I was patient I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw kick, run and kaney. I was patient because I watch them I did it. I saw one help my dad playing we went out to join them. The stuff he tate me was hard but it helped.
3	19	16	I time that I had patience is when my fammle wint to @CAPS1 avencher and @CAPS2 are inline to go on shiver me timbers the bigest coster at park. “@CAPS2 are in line “, I said to a kid that had cut in front of my friend @PERSON1 and I as @CAPS2 wint up the ramp to get on the ride. The kid wint to the back of the line that gust got longer, @CAPS3 and kids sremed. As @CAPS2 got up to the top of the ramp the ride harp masst up so @CAPS2 set there for about a hower, and then they fix it @CAPS2 get in and I tobe off my glasses. The ride stared.

2	17	19	On @DATE1 it was my birthday I was just turning @NUM1. I was so happy!!! Well while I was being happy and my big sisters were getting thing together for my party my mom was at work. We had everything at the party thing such as juice, pop, food, candy, chips, icecream, but no cake. My mom was suppose to pick it up when she got of work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and icecream. We had the icecream but no cake, but I didn’t cry and scream like a baby, my sister did but she was still @NUM2 and I was @NUM1 and I had to act as a @NUM1 year old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she get my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was @NUM1!
0	24	24	I elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago,” @CAPS2 how much longer?” The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, “not much longer now dear.” @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but can’t help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope.” @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now.” @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. “You know it’s funny,” @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. “@CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person out there!” I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that I’m a patient person.  stand in the
2	16	18	When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was really fun. @CAPS1 because I wanted a lot of stuff that my family couldn’t afford, my mom was very patient. I guess she’s just naturaly patient. I just don’t know how she does it. Anyway, throughout the entire store, it’s pretty big. It’s two stories tall! My mom a little angry with me because I kept on getting mad at her. @CAPS1 even though she got really angry with me, she tried to do her best to not show how angry she was in the store @CAPS1 by the time we got home I was so tired, I could’ve slept for a whole two to three days! We got everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day we had to put up our night stands. @CAPS1 I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was almost literally hourding my dad to put our bed. @CAPS1 when the time came, I was fed @CAPS1 my mom was mad at me cause I wanted to sleep in my bed that night.
1	17	16	One day my dad and I had a doctor’s appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take. The doctors said abott @NUM2 more minutes so we waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor  still didn’t come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said few more minutes we waited for @NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late. That’s how me and my dad were patient.
1	18	19	I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it.
4	16	12	I was patient in gym class today for my shill test, I did great in got @NUM1 out of @NUM1. We have @NUM3 biols in my class so it was quiet the wait also when it was my town it took a half of a minute to do it. We wasted all have on the shill will and I was waiting to play dodge-ball all have.It starts because we didn’t get to play dodge-ball. So I pretty much wasted my invite have on the shill test and it starts will tests my story, the end.
0	14	14	A time when I was patient was when went to the mall.”@CAPS1 @CAPS2” I said to whoever was behind me my mama and had come to the mall to get some @DATE1 clothes. That mall was crowded. Couldn’t nobody get in where I was getting so patient. The ever had was to understand and it was this white family walking by and they all bumped me. I was so patient waiting in one. I was just ready to left everybody when finally came our time. That was time when I was patient. I was so proud of myself I held at in. The @CAPS3.
4	23	19	One time I was patient. It was dec @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1. On @CAPS1 eve morning I slept till @NUM2 I wanted to?? To come. I was patient so I played video games not thinking about @CAPS1. When I went to the store I seen all the @CAPS1 things. I felt like I could’t wait no longer. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some to @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so??? I knew it would’t be right so I went to sleep??? At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I waited.
3	24	21	@PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girlâ€™s choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. â€œ@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.â€ I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1â€™s friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1â€™s better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now itâ€™s @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself donâ€™t be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasnâ€™t because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1â€™s I have a note taped to it. It reads â€œ@CAPS3 me your phone number and Iâ€™ll call you for the @NUM1.â€. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think heâ€™s testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didnâ€™t ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.â€™ When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word. Yes!
1	7	6	One time my friend was waitin for I stay in there a hole hour I was takin my time he wait though he couldnt to I got out the bathroom I said thankz he said anytime I was surprised at her.
5	24	19	This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1.There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So i packed a magazine, some  paper my @CAPS1 and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didn’t know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids!” “@CAPS3!” @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. Tthat is the story of a time I was patient
8	17	9	When im patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come sometimes it could just be a fawn. Other  times it can be does. put when you see a buck ???is everything you first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does you have to wait to bring up your gun. Then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it you be patient and wait for it to die. If you cdnt find it right away dont give up. That is when I was patient.
0	24	24	Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.
1	17	16	A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn’t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”
5	12	7	One day it was me and my mother we was going to the store @CAPS1 we had to go and pick up my big brother from basketball practice @CAPS1 we got there and he wasn’t outside @CAPS1 my mother was calling his phone phone and he wasn’t answering @CAPS1 my mother keep calling @CAPS1 my mother said that were going to wait until he get out now that’s what I call patience.
5	24	19	Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know lur lne being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from mom il just not pretty. But one time l really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at kings' island @NUM1 hours just to go on illegible. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us was nicor because me line shortned some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride.
1	16	17	A time when I was patient well it didn’t just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just don’t go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I don’t complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewlery make up perfume and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion I am very patient for my mother no matter what.
0	16	16	A time I was patient was when I went to get my teath cleaned than ??? that i went  to doctors. I waited  three (@NUM1 )hours  to get my teath cleaned and that was hand so I took a book out to read than when I was on reading the book about @NUM2 ½ times I got called to get my teath cleaned, after that  I went to the doctors to get wald, medisan refilled and get some shoes.

So I waited about five hours and five minutes, after all that time I finally went to eat some lunch at @ORGANIZATION1. That was all I did that day.
4	4	8	When I was patient I had no fears no argument but I had a good deal .I had a @CAPS1  @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said “@CAPS2 I get some”  I said “ @CAPS3 you @CAPS2” @CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gasstation .I went to @ORGANIZATION1 .I said ,”@NUM1 @CAPS5 please “ @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine and she said ,” @NUM2 days ago “ I was like “ wow “ @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy’s weekend she said ,” get down there now I was like  wow.

1	21	20	Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don’t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!

0	22	22	One day, last year I had to be really patient my mom had told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldn’t wait so I asked her when and she said she didn’t know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week I was just happy that school was finally out so I didn’t have to worry about home-work. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldn’t randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didn’t have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because that’s better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been.
