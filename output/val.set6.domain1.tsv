0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirgibles to the Empire State Building.
1	4	3	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out.
0	4	4	The weight was an obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the to of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified & strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be to heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't made for that much weight. Some dirigible were highly flammable ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was to dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other building in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell...."" The last obstacle was the law. ""The other particle reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This law wouldn't allow dirigible to land at the Empire State Building due to its location.
1	2	1	The builders faced many problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle the had was the wind. At that elevation the was constantly shifting. If the dirigibles was tethered the back would swivel. Another problem was that they could not weigh it down. Sence it was elevated if the dirigible was weighted down it would fall. Those are some of the obstacle the builder faced.
0	3	3	New York is said to be, ""the city that never sleeps."" The people of New York are always awake, rushing about in the streets. When four-term governor, Al Smith, wanted  to put up a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, these people of New York had many concerns. Along with the people whom were constructing the building. These concerns consisted of laws, saftey and construction.If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area. Another major worry was safety. These dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic. The construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the projectOverall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created. Too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began.
0	4	4	In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing too much stress on the building. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast, was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mass, an unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the except claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4) The moor provided severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This problem served as a serious problem, thus serving as an obstacle for the builders of the mooring mass. The building's foundations, nature, and safety violations all served as problems for the builders creating the mooring mass.
0	3	3	When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into @NUM1 dock for limps proved to be unrealistic.The first challenge that they came across was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating such stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made.Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually consitered illigal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps.
0	2	2	Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the buildings frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Over @MONEY1 would be needed for this to happen.
0	0	0	Al Smith was a very competitive person: one of @CAPS1 Al had to go through is competing with another building and he had to make his building taller Than the Chrysler building. Wich in @DATE1 if he didn't make his building taller he would of lost the tittel of The tallest building in new york
1	3	2	One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place. The strong, always changing winds, the winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship, they consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians is not safe at all. Another reason was, it was against the law to fly aircrafts to low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this wasn't gonna to work.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (Lüsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (Lüsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach.
1	4	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains some problems architect Al Smith experienced when constructing the world's tallest building in the 1920s. For example, ""The greasest issues was one of safety."" Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was ""nature itself."" Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock. For example, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The entire idea was eventually dropped by the late 1930s. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the creation of ""The Mooring Mast.
0	3	3	There were many problems the builders of the Empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles.They faced problems with ""... Violent air currents"" That flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State building. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Lüsted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State building was never used to dock dirigibles.
1	4	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had find away that would not make the building to unstable ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles was the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases with in were extremely flamible ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen... and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The final obstacles the builders would have to face was that there is a law that does not allow airships to come to close to the ground in urban areas. So in conclution we can see that even though it was a good idea to port dirigible is was not a practical one.
0	3	3	In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced Problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One big obstacle is that the dirigibles were a safety hazard. For example ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed. Another issue was nature, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around, making it unsafe. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately could never dock a dirigible at the Empire State building
0	3	3	There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building. Also, when the mooring station was completed, the wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is said that most @CAPS2 dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets it would be terrible. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire state building, wind, stability, and safety are just a few.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying the low over urban areas posed a new problem. even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place! Planes were also becoming more popular.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was saftey, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is also highly flammable. Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to moor a dirigible
0	2	2	There were a few obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company. After all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast
1	4	3	Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One proble they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg. Then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city they could easly crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tryed to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstical builders would have to over come was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally.
0	3	3	Based on excerpt, ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents, and the safety of pedestrians.One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1 the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as the violent air currents and the city pedestrians.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve.One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control.All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true.
1	2	3	Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible wer tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM2) These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast.
0	3	3	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders had to face many obstacles while constructing the Empire State building to be able to allow drigibles to dock there. The builders had to face many obstacles such as laws @CAPS1 Changes and the building @CAPS2, that was not thought about while the idea was accumulating. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the empire State building a docking for Dirigibles, the new airships they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mask was being designed architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the Empire States building's flat roof."" ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realize that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas the dirigibles idea wouldnt be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to over come. The obstacles the builders had to face When attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building were safety laws, weather and the building @CAPS2.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking.
0	2	2	When the builders of the Empire state Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obsticles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, structural integrity, and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" The builders had to modify the building's frame. These modifications cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside. This required a lot of extra work for the builders. Dispite the obsticles, the boilders got the job done.
0	3	3	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. over sixty thousand dollars modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen which is highly flammable and dangerouss. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to there much safer usual landing of open fields. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues.
0	0	0	1.) dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the @NUM1.) they had a top speed of @NUM2 miles plus cruise at @NUM3 miles per @NUM4.) Some were as long as @NUM5 feet.
0	4	4	The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were two strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM1). Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take in to consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (¶ @NUM3). The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It needed to be changed entirely to accommodate landing dirigibles: ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The biggest obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were easily swayed in times of bad weather: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties, therefore the mooring mast was never used.
1	3	4	In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building.
1	4	3	There were many obstacles the builder's of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof, a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. Also if they wanted to do this, it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constatly shifting due to violent air currents. To reduce this dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but the obstacle to this is having weights dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State building with a mooring mast.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible. As said in paragraph @NUM1. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @NUM2.  There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with
0	3	3	The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money! Those are the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. safety was most important, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe In the reading it states that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flameable."" @CAPS1 it is flameable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high populated area like New York City. Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mask at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere The winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done about the dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building.
1	2	1	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building flat roof. When they tryed to build it there was not enough space so they tried to force it but that @CAPS1 mess everything up. ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without strees to the building's frame."" At times when they try to add things that made the building only heavyer and more likely to fall. They try to add more things to only make it look better but what they didn't know is that it was only gain to fall more.
0	1	1	In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through alot of work, effort, and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. They were afraid that it would knock over one day. They also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. The transportation was to the airplanes. The dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay.
0	3	3	In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. They faced way to many problems.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstical was that it lacked safty. Dirigibles are highly flammable machiens when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York City would be tragic..  Another obstical that the Mooring Mast faced was @CAPS1 Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with a electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds of @ORGANIZATION3 were to blow on this situation, the diridles would ""swivel around & around the mask"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) this would cause tension to build on the buildings frame and lead to a very unsafe inviorment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated that it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safty reasons leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be unusable.
0	4	4	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structeral and safty issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the exsisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
1	3	2	There were three main @CAPS1 that the builders faced: safety, Nature and THE LAW.The first obstacle that they faced was safety. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium. While Helium is a @CAPS2 gas, Hydrogen is a @CAPS3 which are combustible.The second obstacle they faced was Nature. The @CAPS4 winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aero dynamic, it was @CAPS5 to manever them.The third obstacle was a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low, so if the other @CAPS1 didn't exist, it would still be illegal.IN conclusion, they Should Have built a @CAPS6 because @CAPS7 are simply better than Blimps.
0	3	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers have quietly disappeared.
0	3	3	There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph @NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph @NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.
0	1	1	The builders had a tough obstacle Because They in @CAPS1 were tryn to @CAPS2 A overall @CAPS3 Building. And were tryn to compete. The Dirigibles were A @CAPS3 part in Building The empire State Building Because They were faced with obstacles That were hard like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, Height and ext. These were the @CAPS7. On Dirigibles to @CAPS8 There were The Dirigibles were not heavy @CAPS9 They @CAPS10't @CAPS8 as well And It was made with light mater ials. These are The reasons why This happens.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The frist major problem they came across was the biulding its self. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the biuldings foundation."" The biulding being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so @CAPS1 already. The architects next obstienle was saftey expessally in a highly populated area such as down town New York. They found the Dirigibles to be to dangerous and uncontroble in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to complete change to acumulate. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of popurtion after the Hindenburg insodent. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast such as the Los Angeles and Columbia but the mast was never put to good use and shows the Problems with inovating things already @CAPS1 as the Empire State building.
1	3	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there ware extrem to over come.one obstacles for the builders was trying to make it so the building its self could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to the to the building with wind pulling at it and swaying back and forth as wind direction changes.Also it is to low for a dirigibles to be flying because of the other buildings. The most important is the gases inside the dirigible is flamible and would be devistation to the people below in New York City.
1	1	0	they haD to worry aBoat the. Saftey for the pepole, to keep it still as they DockeD. How they woaD @CAPS1 it anD the posible out comes if something DiD @CAPS2 wrong.
1	2	1	The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air. They needed special gear to do it. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while building it One obstacle they hit was the dirigibles couldnt dock there because of no mooring mast When the architects and engineers built the building they put a flat roof which the Mooring Mast could not be placed on. They said that the frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to fix the situation. Another obstacle was they couldnt have a Rope holding the Mooring Mast up because the dirigibles wouldnt hold it up. Those are some obstacles the architechs went threw.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.
1	0	1	In the expert the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The fabiric that they use for dirigibles is very lighter. ""Cotton frabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them ligther than hair.They also imply that the architects did not try hard enough to solve the problems.""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose...
0	3	3	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired.
0	3	3	The Empire State Building face a lot of obstacles like in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This was one of the many trouble there was for dirigibles to land on the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM2, They @CAPS1 to realize that the mooring mast of the @ORGANIZATION1n't of been build, because it wouldn't work."" The Mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfil it's purpose, for reason that should have been apperent before it was ever constructed. The reason that mooring mast was because of nature. As you will see on paragraph @NUM3, ""the Wind were shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast had a lot of problems scinc the beginning when Al Smith put a top to the building making it 1,250. It was unsafe for planes. When they wanted to make the Dirigibles land on top of the building. Dirigibles that came from another countries had hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The problem that worked anginst the mooring mast being buit was wind on top of the building @CAPS2. Because of the air currents. These are the reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the Empire State Building
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear.
0	1	1	The Empire State Building faced @CAPS1 difficulties to have the dirigibles to dock there. Wind pressure from the dirigibles messed up the buildings frame work. To accommodate the situation they paid Over Sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the buildings framework.
0	3	3	The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire were saefty, nature, and U.S law. Saefty was a major obstacle because, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lin @NUM2). Nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. ""The Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 line @NUM4). One final obstacle that would hault the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State building was U.S law. The law was agaist airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illeagle for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approch the area"" (@CAPS1 @NUM5 line @NUM6).
1	3	4	Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.
0	3	3	In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, There were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, natures winds, and laws that prevent dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks, in New York City."" Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."", doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested.
0	2	2	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished due to @CAPS1 Nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building.
1	2	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new Situation. Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.
0	1	1	The builders of the empire State building faced alot of obstacles. One problem they had was when & if they landed getting an area for the people to get on and off. they had to make the platform bigger also. When the dirigibles landed it was because they needed more fuel @CAPS1 it would only be a couple hours they were stopped.
0	4	4	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped.
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also even if it could tie up the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercefuly. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task
1	2	1	The architects had few problems. As said in @LOCATION1, stress from the Dirigibles Load was too much for The building. They would @CAPS1 over sixty thousand Dollars of modifications. Other Then That They @CAPS2 had to redesign And then make it.
1	2	1	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced.
1	1	0	The empire State building had to face dangerous condition every day like @CAPS1 winds, heavy lifting, High heights.
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted tpo.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed.
0	0	0	The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 people faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is they would have to have different make new Routes that was yet to get made and existing transatlantic Routes.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. Lüsted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (Lüsted @NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. Lüsted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (Lüsted @NUM1). The dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast.
0	2	2	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.
1	3	2	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds.
0	3	3	From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. Later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that ""outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. Another reasing of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong. Those are obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1.
1	3	4	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.
0	4	4	Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affeted by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented them from becoming a big landing spot for dirigibles.
1	1	2	There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the empire state building.  First off the height of the building more come into question as much and there were to many discussions about the Top of the building.  The empire state buildings first goal was to be the future of city they wanted to food people onto blimp.  another problem is where really is know way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building and the large aircrafts are not suppose to fly back close to the building because other building are around.  In conclusion, they did face many problems.
0	4	4	In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.
0	3	3	The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spining around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles, would swivel around the mast unless tied down. The next problem or obstacle was making the buildings structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The next challenge was to create a safe enviroment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city was already made below. The drigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Clearly the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building.
1	3	2	The @CAPS1 had many obstacles Building the Empire State Building and also allowing Dirigibles to @CAPS2 there. one of the obstacles was the expanded use in New York City. As said on page @NUM1 paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the Lack of a suitable Landing Area"". Another obstacle was use of mooring mast was Nature itself. Also said on pg @NUM2 paragraph @NUM3. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself"". The @CAPS3 Obstacle was weather for an example On page @NUM4 paragraph @NUM5 ""The @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast But could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" @CAPS4 are @NUM2 concluding examples of obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to @CAPS2 near Empire State Building.
1	3	2	well, since this one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area For the dirigibles. So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And to let the passengers on and off there also. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line From the front of ship then tied to the Mast. But, then yet the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these Dirigibles load and the wind pressure would transmitte all the way to the building's Foundation. The steel Frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This means it was difficult to land the Dirigibles. Another problem they faced was nature. The wind and weather could make a landing the dirigibles very dangerous. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is an easy. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face.
0	3	3	Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful.
0	2	2	In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle. Which was attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there.  Not to mention Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area. As well as not being able to fit. Thus, there was some need of more area space. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible being so long. It also shows how would these architects come up with a plan in making this work, so that way it would fit properly. Therefore, there was an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced. Which was the lack of a suitable area.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt The mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and the laws against airships flying to low over urban areas.If they let the dirigibles dock there they would risk the dirigibles @CAPS2 on fire because dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. and the Hydrogen is highly flammable. Another Obstacle would be the Wind, the winds were Shifting because of violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around, and if they put weights on the back it would not be safe for pedestrians on the street. And the last obstacle would be the law against airships flying to low over urban area, I would make it illegal for a Ship to tie to the building. Those were the @CAPS1 they faced.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a big threat to The nearby pedestrians. Furthermore, an additional obsticle is ""nature itself"". The winds are constantly changing which is dangerous for the dirigibles. One last example of an obsticle is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would be dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian. These are @CAPS1 some examples In the article of how there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street."" (@NUM1). This was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1) This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" (@NUM3) The owners of the Empire State building saw this as another huge problem because of how much worse it would be if one caught fire in densely populated New York.
0	3	3	Besides The facts That docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on The empire State building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of Stress to the buildings frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream.Unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. paragraph @NUM2 says docking The dirigibles is plain dangerous because The Wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, Rather than being docked on The ground and being weighed down. Lastly, It wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in The air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because pedestrians below.
0	3	3	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose.
0	3	3	The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building met with failure because of a variety of reasons. One of the major problems was that it was directly over the downtown area of New York City which is very densely populated. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, ""the owners... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area.""The second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent winds at the top of the tower. It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe.""Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities. Despite the two dirigibles that approached the mooring mast, neither managed to allow passengers to disembark, and the idea was ""quietly dropped"" as it should have been. There were too many obstacles for it to succeed.
0	4	4	In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problem. These problems in which builders would be forced to deal with is when, a city, and framework. First off, the building frame was too weak to tied to a dirigible. This is because it ""would add stress"" to the frame which could ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Due to this they would be forced to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars"" to strengthen the frame. A second issue the were faced with is that it is in a city. Laws had prohibited ""flying too low over urban areas"", let alone ""tie up to the building"". Due to this fact, they would be forced to design a way for it to dock. Finally, ""violent air currents"" would cause more issues. The builders would have to deal with building a piece mooring equipment that could with stan the wrath of ""nature itself"". All in all, this plan would force many issues on the builders, in order to function
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and preasure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original frame work to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the preasure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flamible and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in fire and they didn't want that to happen over New york's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it in unpracticle docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s after airplanes, and dirigibles had disappeared the ticketing & bagging rooms were turned into tourist and site seers areas.
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there according to the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. First obstacle they had to make the mooring mast safe for passengers to board on and off. The Architects had engineers and such working on it. Another obstacle the Architects had to work with was putting the mooring mast up on the building. So, then they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' added to the framework of the building so that it would be sturdy for the mooring mast. Once the mooring mast was set up and they ""celebrated framing the entire building,"" just another problem occurred ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" the winds were constantly shifting and caused the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Finally they fixed all of their problems for this building to be in use then the biggest obstacle occurred, dirigibles became  illegal and air planes became the new transportation. The builders of the Empire State building had just too many obstacles and failed
1	2	3	While the Empire State Building was being built the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the one in charge of this project, had a goal to build the tallest building. Right of the bat, the first problem occurred. The Chrysler Building had a secret 185-foot spire inside, and made this building now @DATE2, 46 ft taller then the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shinned apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building.
0	4	4	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This would cause the building to have to weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast, so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). In order for this to be completed, builders had to complete the roof. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street. The Mooring Mast, supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building.
1	3	4	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome.
0	2	2	The obstacles the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the safety of the people below. Also As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" Another main reason is in @CAPS2 @NUM2. The wind currents were violently shifting.
0	2	2	There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock. For one the Empire State building natural structure can't handle its weight. Therefor architects had to make a stainless steel tower. Even after this was made they realized how flamable helium and hydrogen are. Not only that the airwaves at the top of that building are extremely violent. The idea was eventually forgotten about due to the possible accidents that could happen.
0	3	3	In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". (@NUM1). Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban aera and that's against the law.
0	3	3	In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing it's gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel the dirigibles would weaken the building's structure. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building @CAPS1 they could dock dirigibles.
1	3	4	The Empire State Building was an incredible building without the idea of the attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. But with this idea of this mooring mast it braught up many obstacles like the safety of the public. Lüsted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement proves that if the dirigible were catch fire like the accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the citizens of New York's lives would be at stake. This safety hazard is one of the builder's problems.     These archatets faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea. Including the dangerous factor of nature. Lüsted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because the dirigibles start to move around the building while docked causing hazardous menuvers and putting pedestrian's lives at risk. For this mooring idea, it is too dangerous for the public and the city of New York.
0	1	1	They had to build the tower just right or els there would be landing problems if they added the sight seeing thing People would pay any price but the price of keeping it stable was not worth the effort. In the end the people were like going to make this a very popular thing but it was not up to them if it was or wasnot popular Wind and Landing always stood in there way so they paid alot-o-money to restableise the building. This ended up being a profit and ride of a lifetime
1	1	2	The greatest obstacle to the Successful use or the mooring mast was nature itself. The-winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. law against airships flying to low over urban areas.
0	3	3	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The winds blew the dirigibles two-and-frow. It would be cotastrophic if an accident occurred. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the @NUM1 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	When the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area.
0	1	1	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it @CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced @CAPS1 obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. The most blatant one was the height at which they would dock. Al Smith states ""The Empire State would reach the height of @NUM1 feet,"" @CAPS1 Dirigibles from outside the U.S. Were extremly Flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. Another obstacle was wind. If the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly Swivel around. USing led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical. The last one was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over a urban area illegal. No Ship would be allowed to fly over downtown New York.
0	1	1	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock they are making sure they dont bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers. They are trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings. It is also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they don't get to close and thats why they are droping the papers down with ropes @CAPS1 if they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building.
1	2	3	In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work.
0	4	4	When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed.
1	3	2	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was dificult. The builder met with experts to better understand the way the dirigibles work. He also was told that architects couldn't put a mooring mast on top because of the buildings flat roof. Paragraph nine States a thousand-foot dirigible- held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" The stress would then be passed all the way down to the buildings foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder put over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building. After all that time and money he was told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles greatest obstacle was the wind, if it moved in the air that could be a problem. Although this plan didnt work, its still 1,250 ft and taller than the Chrysler building.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire state Building faced obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obsticle was safety for pedestrians and the building itself. Most of the dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. They didnt want the dirigible to explode and fall over pedestrians and catch the whole building on fire. Safety is the main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock there.
1	3	4	Builders in The Mooring @CAPS1 by @ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome. as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM1) This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New @CAPS1 it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back the ship would swiveled around, and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2) This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law @CAPS2 aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there.
0	3	3	In this excerpt Al Smith had many obstacals to over come when he wanted Dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The smallest obstacal was building this top so Dirigibles could moor at the building. ""The top would have cost Over @ORGANIZATION1 for the needed modifications on the Frame work"". Another obstacal faced was the fact that there was an existing law in place @CAPS1 this. ""The other practical reason Dirigibles could not more at the empire State building was an existing law against low flying air ships."" The issue of safety was a tricky obstacle. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is very @CAPS2. The Greatest obstacle was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting Due to violent air currents."" In this excerpt The obstacals For Al Smith and his team were to great and they could not over come them.
1	4	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that was faced was the buildings foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1	4	3	The builders of the empire state building face a lot of problems on trying to make a dock for dirigibles.  The builders could not just simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.  They had to think about how the dirigible @LOCATION2 fair, they had to strengten the foundation of the building and a landing area for the dirigible.  Dirigibles were able to dock him by means of an electric winch The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York city was a densely populated area.  A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.  The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong.
0	4	4	In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the first problems they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
0	4	4	In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders came up on structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"". Also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flamable gas hydrogen that was used in non-American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens. The mast was also in-practical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon.
1	3	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem that the workers faced was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible... would add Stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the frame would have to be Strengthened. Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be above pedestrians on the street. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed.
0	2	2	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacals when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would put stress on the buildings fam. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Theese are the obstacals they had to @ORGANIZATION1.
0	3	3	The dirigibles had @NUM1 obstacles to face, They had posidletys of fire, poping, and law troudle. They feared the dirigible would get on fire for it has hydrogen, that is rather highly flammable. They do not want to relate to the acsident that happened in lakehurst, New Jersey in May 6, 1937. also withe the fear of pops rase more concens. for the wind might blow it of chores into another building with a sharpe top that could possibley puncher the baloon. The feared this happening in downtown New York were it is highly populated. another reson prodley the biggest was that Empire State Building wanted a law for air crafts flying low over urban areas, so that ment there was no chance they could do what they were planing on doing.
1	2	3	There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day.
1	3	4	Architects and builders working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. The first problem builders came across was the possibility that the building's framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. It was said in paragraph nine that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky. Another obstacle that builder's came across ""was nature itself."" @CAPS1 some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intensely violent and be destroyed by flammable gas. The next obstacle builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for sake of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
2	3	1	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to think about the Safety of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers dock there. They had to think about the winds at the top of the building. The wind currents change violently at the top of the building and because they wouldn't be able to weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin around and around the mooring mast. They also had to think about dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen which is more flammable then the helium ships.
0	3	3	When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. 
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with trying to build a docking station for dirigibles. They first needed to make @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building to ""accommodate this new situation."" This however, was an obstacle they were able to overcome. The next problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is flammable, and after the fire of the Hindenburg, people realized how potentially dangerous this docking idea was. Another problem was the weather. High winds could cause problems when the dirigibles are trying to dock. To top off, this list of problems is the fact that there is a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never successful.
0	1	1	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose.
1	2	1	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. In paragraph @NUM1 it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger. ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" and ""The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners.""Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @NUM2 Smith says, ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.
1	3	2	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is the winds on top on the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. Also the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So if it blows up, there gonna be a lot of bad things going on in New york. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over Urban areas. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there.
0	3	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the empire state building had to deal with many obsticles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author tells us the readers that dirigibles were actually enormous steelframed balloons. with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. While the builders were trying to droop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof. In the excerpt tells us the reader that ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. All though the dirigible is as light as the air it could mess up the frame of the building. Another obsticle the buildors had to face was when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the empire state building realized how much worse it would have been the accident happened in New York such as a populated are as downtown. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". Even though the empire state building didn't get to put moors on top of the building it still became the world's tallest building.
1	0	1	The obstacles that the builders of the empire State building was really difficult. The worker had to make sure that the building was'nt so tall that it would so tilt. The workers also faced competition They needed there building to be the biggest and they didn't give up until there building was in fooy the tallest building in @CAPS1.
0	3	3	Al Smith and the engineers faced many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obsticle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen, hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, this could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and killing millions. Another obsticle they faced was mother nature, In a height like 1,250 ft, theire are incredible winds blowing, and someone even unexpected, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. Findly, the law prohibites the dirigible to be ""flying too low over urban areas."" therefore doing this would be illegal. the building faced many obstacle, it got through most of them, but in the end it would be extremly unsafe to go on with mast.
0	3	3	The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast.Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating, that airships cannot fly to close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimphs of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be post-poned. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible.
0	3	3	Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develope a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive hight of the empire state building. the architects also had to do extra research to develope the mast. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe secure way. These obsticles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream.
0	3	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.
1	3	4	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced was that the wind, the climate was always a risk and the height of the building was also a chalange for the builders of the empire State building.  
0	3	3	Allowing dirigibles stock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The final obstacle was that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when tempting to let dirigbles dock there. There were @NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.     In, conclusion there were many obstacles that the archtects dont think about before constructing.
2	0	2	Dirigibles also known today as Blimps used to dock at the empire state building. The Empire State building was used as a docking ground for dirigibles (which are enormous steel formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter then air). They had a top speed of @NUM1 mph for thousands of miles. ""Al Smith saw an opportunity for the empire state building: A moor added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" As stated in the excerpt. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch which stopped the big balloon from going anywhere and tied it to the mast. Al Smith was successful when building moore cause it was good for dirigibles.
0	2	2	The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there with out it poping. There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop. for all those reason they had to concider them to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building.
0	4	4	In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin.
1	3	4	During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful.
1	3	2	Obstacles the bulders faced was if they put a Mooring @CAPS1 At the top of the building it will Add stress to the building and they would have to modify the building to support the mooring @CAPS1. Another @CAPS2 they @CAPS3 is safty Most @CAPS4 Are Filled with Hydrogen which Are Highly Flammable. If there was A Fire it could @CAPS5 @CAPS6 of people Due to the fact its A Densely Populated Area. Nature Itself Also seems to @CAPS7 A @CAPS2 the winds Above the building were very Violent. then theirs the law where Airships can @CAPS9 Low Above urban areas.
0	3	3	The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. The gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose"".
1	3	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings framed if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The buildings frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework. some other obstacles builders faced was the safety. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds shifted at the top of the Empire State building were shifting due to violent air currents. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared.
0	1	1	When the Empire State building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to @CAPS1 the structure. They had sudently had found some problems with one being the top of the empire state building.      Workers had tryed to figure out hwo they were going to but a Dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and to drop them off up there but there were different problems.
0	4	4	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast.
0	3	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted There were important obstacles The builders of the Empire State Building faced for the dirigibles to dock and becomes stationary there. The dirigible was highly flammable, struchure was unsafe laws and it was @CAPS4 prmitting for them to dock There.One, The dirigibles are highly flammable to have have near a building that has so much importance to its @CAPS1. ""Today These dirigibles are camo. fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to have lighter in the air."" These dirigibles in the U.S only have hydrogen which is the ultimate firestarter.Second, the structure never passed for a human passenger to get on The structure and ride The blimp. The law states ""aircraft flying low to urban areas is @CAPS2."" @CAPS3 why it never could happen.Third, @CAPS4 can never always be right twenty-four seven. The problem is ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting violent air currents."" This Put lives in @CAPS5, these were obstacles in The dirigibles docking.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State building faced some obstacles in there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they had was the violent winds blowing the blimp around at a high altitude, with people onboard, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"". Another set back was it being illegal to fly an aircraft that low, it was ""illegal for ship to tie up to a building,"". Also it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable. The Mooring Mask of the Empire State Building became nothing More than an attraction for sightseers.
1	3	2	When Designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state Building there were @CAPS1 oBstacles that the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 were faced with. One proBlem was they couldent @CAPS4 drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building Because it was too @CAPS5 for the frane of the Building. So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was @CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed dangerous Because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldent @CAPS8 having @CAPS9 happend to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors aBove city streets that were crowded with people. So those Were @CAPS4 a few oBsticals that @CAPS2 were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced alot of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles. One is that in the story it says that dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire. Another problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas. Those are some obstacles the builders faced.
0	3	3	When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obsticle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could colapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked.
0	3	3	There were many obsticles in the process of building the process to build a mooring mast. The designers had to think they're way around them.It was easily known you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. There were acomidations to be made. The exerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" (@CAPS1). Just adding it on would upset the buildings structure and foundation.Safety was a concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" (@CAPS1). After recent fires, it was noticed now dangerous this idea was.Control was an issue in the city; rather than an open feild. ""... the back of the ship would swivle around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). That wasn't going to'fly' with most people, It would be almost imposible to keep it @CAPS4 for people loading. Designers face a lot of problems in constructing buildings but in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't ment to be.
0	3	3	Right now I going to tell us Some of the obtacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, In paragraph @NUM1, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This is why never was completed the mooring mast (dirigible) for this serious obstacles to put this in the Empire state building.
1	3	2	Obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were blind. The tuge and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangers for passangers and the buildings foundation. However, making such attemps were eleagl for dirigibles to fly over urban areas, incase of failer. Spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach also in case of puncher. Spending sixty thousand on modification to moor mast on the @ORGANIZATION2 for the safe dock of dirigibles. The idea was lost to the creation of the mordern new airplane.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City.
1	2	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp. Another @CAPS1 that proves that the builders Empire State faced, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"" The winds on top of the building made it dangerous. clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced.
0	3	3	In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamable. This would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have docked, would have been way to strong. As the passage says ""the winds on top of the building were constanly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). One last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from fly to close to neiborhoods. All and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of people.
0	3	3	Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (¶ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there.
1	3	2	In the excerpt, they tell some reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. In paragraph 6, it says, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" That quote shows had dirigibles were losing popularity due to the airplane.
2	1	3	The builders and architects faced several different obstacles & dilemnas that intefered with the construction of the Empire State Building. One of them being the funds necessary in order to produce such a large structure. They found themselves constructing and reconstructing the frame of the structure time and time again, all in a feeble attempt to reach the desired perfection. Another obstacle occurred when their entire concept shattered by the fact that not every dirigible intended to land on the mast was fueled by helium. The text reads, ""Most digribles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This displays the severity of the idea, where risks like that just could not be taken, so they abandoned the idea of the mooring mast.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building.  The stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much, this was their obstacle.  The builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired.
1	2	3	Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety.
1	2	1	One obstacle that the builders faced was that havin dirigibles hanging over a heavy populated area was extremely dangerous, because May 6, 1937 the german's dirigible was destroyed by fire, another obstacle was that it was illegal to have blimps flying to low over heavy populaded areas. So Al Smith had to let go of that plan.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This means that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work. Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles. The author also states that they asked people to test the dirigible. They had to work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to work properply. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930's.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building.
0	3	3	The idea of docking a one thousand feet long dirigible to a mast eleven-hundred feet above the ground never seemed possible. From the factual evidence provided in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the theory is proven failure. ""Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to branish around the mast. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was the law forbidding air vessels of flying too low over urban areas. A problem that would condemn the theory from the start.
0	3	3	When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be.
0	3	3	Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders put reality before theory in order to pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders realize how dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would sway the ship around the Mooring @CAPS1, becoming dangerous. The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a hault in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe.
0	1	1	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstecles in attemping to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. to solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast. This would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours to refuel.
0	2	2	The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. The mast was made so that Dirigibles could land thire and people could get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building.
1	4	3	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there.
0	1	1	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face being up in the air for so long They also had to face trying to dock the dirigible on top of the roof while still stay saft themselfs
1	2	1	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main obstacles was, the lack of a good landing area. Dirigibles were pretty big and there wasn't a great spot for it. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as flour blocks in New York City""- paragraph 6. therefore caused problems to the builders to figure out where to put it.
0	3	3	Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the derigible would add stress to the building's Frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings Frame."" Even though the builders made the mooring mass it was to unsafe to moore dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" In all the builders were faced with to many obstacles and could not manage to moore the dirigibles to the building.
1	3	4	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work.
1	1	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast the builders of the empire state building had to go through many obstacles to get there job done. I paragraph @NUM1 it states that al smith announces that the empire state building will reach a height of @NUM2 feet, this would be a big obstacle for the builders because they have to risk their lives being that high up just to construct this building. Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the exerpt it state that the dirigible a extreamely flammable so if it touches fire the workers could get seriously hurt.
0	1	1	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote by Irving Clavan is saying that there is many problems unsolved because of the height made. Which means its harder to do because of how high it is. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible."" They're pointing that out because if ever a chance of a mess up and it starts to come crashing down, its coming down on one of the most populated cities in america. These are some obstacles builders have to face.
0	3	3	The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp.Another major problem, was the dirigibles themselves They were filled with combustable hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the debris would fall on the pedestrians' below. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas.""In conclusion, due to laws, the dirigibles and nature, the mooring mast was not used.
1	4	3	Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to.
1	4	3	The builders' expectations were set too high and they faced many obstacles they had not foreseen. Safety was a big issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" With a highly populated city like New York, it would have been easy for a fire to begin. Another obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was nature. The wind at times could be too powerful. As said the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land and serve as safe transportation.The last obstacle was that it was illegal. The had @CAPS1 been a law against it. The reading states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With this law, there was not even a glimpse of hope that this plan could be successful.
0	4	4	Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph @NUM1 it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. The builders, also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph @NUM2 ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". @CAPS1, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the obstacles faced by the builders.
1	4	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders @ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles.
0	3	3	In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were @NUM1 main @NUM2.) After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire"" they realize it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a ""densely populated area such as downtown New @NUM3.) When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far to windy for the light dirigibles to stay in @NUM4.) @CAPS1 with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. ""@CAPS2, unlike dirigible landing fields it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of @CAPS3 just to hold the back of the dirigibles down.@NUM1.) Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newer more efficient way in the late 1930's.A good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose.
1	3	4	In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she talked about the obstacles facest when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles was the safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacle was because of safety. Lüsted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an affect on the dirigibles. Lüsted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: Lüsted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, thats what stop the builders from building the dirigibles.
1	4	3	In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful.
1	3	4	In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many problems were faced. One problem faced was in paragraph nine where it says, ""A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If the did build the dirigible dock, the would have to reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse. Another problem faced was, most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore since hydrogen is Flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area. A more ******* problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at @NUM1 feet. The air currents were so violent, that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM2, the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even through the dirigible dock was a great idea, too many problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go in full effect. On the brighter side, it made the Empire State building the tallest in the world.
0	3	3	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them.Secondly, the wins at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building.
1	2	1	They ran into a few problems when it @CAPS1 to building this. They realized after that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep it steady. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, ' The Mooring Mast' I Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the constructors of the empire state building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles a law against airships flying to low and nature itself made it hard to create such a place in paragraph @NUM1, it says ' The other practical Reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" There was alReady a strong argument on building the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illigal for ship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author tells why nature was a problem she says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" Already the @CAPS1 is showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Drigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe. All those Reasons contribute to the Reason why docking wasn't allowed.
1	2	3	Obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, were not easy to overcome. Most dirigible were massive, @CAPS1 by in this quote dealing with them was no easy task. ""@CAPS2 as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York."" In this quote it tells of their massive size and proves how difficult it would be to control and land them safetly.Another obstacle the workers had to face is modifying the already set structure of the empire state building, also money spent as @CAPS1 by in this quote. ""The Steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" This quote proves that the addition of the mooring mast would be not only tirering for the workers, but also alot of money would be spent on a failed project. They got their tall building, but were unable to achieve mooring mast.
0	2	2	The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock at the empire state building but there were a couple main ones. The first main obstacle was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So with that they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments. With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The last little obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be built and put up. Those were some of the obstacles the builders had to face while trying to put a mooring mast on to of the Empire State building.
1	0	1	The obstaclesthat the builders of the Empire state building faced were those of: 1) it was at a height of @NUM1 feet, @NUM2) how would the passengers be able to get on and off, @NUM3) takes a long time to slow down and @NUM4) the building is said to be 102 floors high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding/observation deck on the 102nd floor for the blimp passengers. some more major obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building had faced were some so intense they are hard to explain those major obstacles were: 1) how to dock the blimps and @NUM2) how many blimps could dock there at one time.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building a great idea. They wanted to be able to tethered dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!
0	3	3	When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they over looked several key factors. The Empire State building is over @NUM1 feet tall, at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the diridible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hoovering over the streets of New York City.
1	2	3	Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire state Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" @CAPS1 the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The wind s on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled.
0	2	2	The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe.
0	4	4	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment. These are the obstacles the builders face, which caused the mooring equipment not to be installed.
0	2	2	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.
1	2	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	The Problems @CAPS1 face with Building dirigibles to dock there was a lack of Suitable land area and the mooring mast could not Be Simply Drop on the empire state Building flat roof and on top of that A dirigible A thousand feet up held By a cable tether would add a lot of stress to the @CAPS2 frame the stress of the dirigible load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the @CAPS2 foundation. And the other Reason was a safety Reason most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen which is highly flammable.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles They would not be able to simply place of mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. The would need to make the frame stronger to with stand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, unpredictable nature and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast.
0	2	2	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible.
1	3	4	Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being the safety of the people below on the streets. In the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly states that it was dangerous because of the dirigible caught fire it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Another obstacle would be that there is a law that is stated in paragraph @NUM2 that says that there is ""An existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The greatest obstacle though was nature itself as stated in paragraph @NUM3. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 the wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast. An idea came into plan that said ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights,"" @CAPS1 why not at the Empire State Building? Safety is the reason because the weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street which would be unsafe. Then flyers who approached the building would fear that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would be unsafe.
0	2	2	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to allow derigibles to dock there are the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents.
0	1	1	The greatest abstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were high violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift. It was neither practical nor safe.
0	3	3	In the exerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced obstacles in an attempt as to allowing dirigibles to dock. One example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building. In paragraph nine it says, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to come up with a safe way to attach it. Another example of an obstacle was that they had to strength and modified the building because in paragraph nine it stated that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundren feet below."" The Stress might be so much for the building that it could cause the building to collapse. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced many obstacles as to allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in New York City.
0	2	2	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not use for landing airship such as the dirigible because it was to dangireous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purpuses.
0	3	3	The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigables would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew it's tail end around to hit a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel.
1	3	4	Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made.
0	3	3	In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants.
0	2	2	From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, the greatest problem builders faced was strengthening the building's foundational base in order to support the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. To combat this, @MONEY1 of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together.
0	4	4	During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra @MONEY1 for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about @ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. @NUM2 was in December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Airplanes became the future.
0	4	4	When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they did not realize how many problems they would encounter. Upon designing the mast on top of the building, designers realized that if a dirigible was docked on to the building, it would add stress to the frame, and therefore, would have to modify the Empire State building's structure. To do this, sixty thousand dollars was needed, as well as more hours of labor. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature got in the way, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (line @NUM1). It would be difficult to dock it to the building, because the dirigible would be constantly swaying due to wind, and passengers could not get on the blimp. Furthermore, blimps usually were moored in open fields, with the aid of lead weights to help weigh them down. If lead weights were introduced in New York City, where it was very populated, they could potentially fall while dangling in the air, endangering pedestrians. In conclusion, builders faced many obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was ""the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) That would make it hard for the dirigibles to be tethered to the mast. Annother problem they faced was the ""existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Also the equipment used to to dock the airships haden't even been installed.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the buildings structure. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another big obstacle was safety. At the Empire State Building's hight it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with hydrogen. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds. of pedestrians on the streets of New York City.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was held by a single cable tether that ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was far below. If the cable tether were to ever break, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger. This cable tether would be too risky to use. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" for the winds they the top of the building. These currents would cause docking to potentially be too time-consuming and dangerous. The builders and architects try to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights."" This was ""neither practical or safe,"" because of the potential danger of the weights falling and hitting New York pedestrians. The builders and architects of this grand project had to quarrel with many gargantuan obstacles in order to dock at the Empire State Building.
1	3	4	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work.
0	3	3	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe.
1	1	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This shows the dirigibles are inpractable and a danger to both the people in it and the people on the street below.
0	1	1	Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea.
0	4	4	Although high expectations were concieved for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the buildings framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared. As described by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast.
0	3	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought.
1	1	2	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety.
0	3	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
0	2	2	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below.
1	4	3	The installation of a mooring mass on top of the Empire State building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the buildings frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" @CAPS1 some of the obstacles the builders ran into
0	3	3	Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building.
1	3	2	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced the @CAPS2 of purfictle placing a thousand foot dirigible on top of the Building which would of not worket out Because of the wind and there was no wait in the back that would of kept the dirigible in place in which now ment that the dirigible would have been swinging back and fort and gave the riesct of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousand of life at dinger. The @CAPS1 also faced the @CAPS2 of getting to micheenery that was needed to @CAPS4 the mooring mast. Another obstacle @CAPS1 had to face was getting aprover do to safety hasits because what had happing to the hindenburg in lakehurst, New Jersey.
0	1	1	In the excerpt there were multiple obstacles the builders faced when allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. First was making the steel frame of the building stronger. The builders also had to make the empire state building 102 stories tall, and make the 101st story an observatory. The last obstacle the faced was building the empire state building. Those are the obstacles that the builders faced when construction the empire state building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" (¶ @NUM1) because it ""would add stress to the building's frame"". (¶ @NUM1) this was a difficulty because the Empire State Building's frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in @MONEY1 in modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"" (¶ @NUM3), there was a great risk of fire; always a problem above New York City. The wind was also a problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM4). The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not feasible in New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders' faced the issue of existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" (¶ @NUM5) This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (¶ @NUM5) Some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the Empire State Building were mast designs, nature and existing air flights laws.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to modify the steel frame of the building. They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4). In the end the problems the builders faced were too many, and unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building was no more.
0	4	4	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flamable (and this could cause a serious fire). Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe.
0	3	3	Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons.
1	2	1	The main obstical was to be the tallest building in the world. That all changed to being able to have a mooring mast so blimps can land on it to drop-off/pick up passengers and refule. They had ""@NUM1 thousand dollars"" in renovations to sturdy the structure of the tower. they couldnt make the foundations sturdy enough to hold the weight of an @NUM2 foot ship + cargo.

0	4	4	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. Those are some obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame in order to make the frame or sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area.
0	3	3	There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropt, though some ships have tried to dock their.
1	2	3	In ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Which made it very difficult to make this project workable.The workers faced safety problems due to chemicals and certain gasses ""Most durigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (Amidon Lüsted ¶ @NUM1 lines @NUM2 + @NUM3) ""The owners of the Empire state Building realised how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Amidon Lüsted ¶ @NUM1 lines @NUM5). The greatest obstacle to their successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in which they could not control.
1	4	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 they described the greatest reason was one of the safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.In paragraph @NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was the nature itself because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even dirigles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, this could be dangerous for pedestrians. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles docking there.
0	2	2	In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable."" Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The derigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @NUM1 feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. So, neadless to say, it wouldn't work out.
0	3	3	The  builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A @NUM1 foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings Frame. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The acciedent of Hindenburg also raised alarm. Hindenburg set fire on Lakehurst in New Jersey. This showed the builders how much worse the acciedent could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as New York. Another factor were the wind currents. They were constantly @CAPS1. This would cause the back Of the dirigible to sway and move about. There was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These are some of the reasons obstacles the builders fased in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building's Mooring Mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" ""The owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe.Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Lead weights could be used, but that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians.
0	3	3	Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" It would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building.

Chrysler building had a trick up his sleeve by constructing 185 foot spire inside the building and the shocked the public.

1	3	4	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome.
0	3	3	In the piece ""The Mooring MAst,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS1 on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around. Lastley, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have.
0	3	3	One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe.
0	3	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as, safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obsticle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around. This is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
1	3	4	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible.  The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was @NUM1 feet below.  So the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably.  Lastly, the last obstacle with the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.  These are the many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their
1	2	1	Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service.
0	1	1	I think the builders main problem they faced was making sure people would be able to safely get off the dirigibles and onto the actual building.They would also need to make sure that the blimp wouldn't burst into flames if it came close or crashed into the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all.
1	3	2	In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to ""accommodate the new situation. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"", @CAPS1 this was a costly project as well. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place.
0	2	2	The architects building the Empire State Building incountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest. This ment that they would have to change the buildings structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Also another issue was purposed in paragraph @NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of of the ship would swivel around the morning mass. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve it's original purpose.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, this task was not so easy. The builders of the Empire State Building could not just drop a mooring mast on its flat roof because they had to consider how the size of the dirigibles were affected. ""The architects could not simile drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it would be difficult to transmit the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The cost to improve the building's framework was also an obstacle. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1).
0	2	2	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building some obastacles they faced were challenging. One name they called the dirigibles in the @DATE1's was ""Transportation of the Future"". There was also an existing law against airships flying to low over open areas. The builders had to make lots of changes to make this perfect and get it the way they want it. Safty was the most important, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of using helium. Although hydrogen is highly flammable, they still used it. In addition ""The highest open observation deck, Intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public"". And to this day is not open for the public to use.
0	2	2	In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders went through obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the @ORGANIZATION1, the builders had to redesign the top of the Empire State Building. They had to make it taller and more suitable for the dirigibles to land. They went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit. Second, the had to design the mast. The builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast. The builders faced that big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle because the had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steal on the tower. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock The builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now
1	3	4	The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (@NUM1) the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents causing the dirigible's back to swivel around the mooring mast. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) @CAPS1 the Hindenburg which blew up, if a Blimp blew up over downtown New York, tons of lives would be lost, a huge risk to the mooring mast. ""Was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law would prevent dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast legally. All of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the world's tallest building.
1	1	2	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders had to face was they had ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders faced was meeting the president of a airship transport company and the plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. That is just two of the many obstacles the builders faced while building the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the Empire State Building. First, allowing this dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building ""would add stress to the buildings frame"". -@CAPS1 @NUM1. These Dirigibles are highly flamable and over a very populated place like New York City could be very dangerous. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""-@CAPS2 @NUM2. If lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians. The biggest obstacle was that a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This seemed to be a good idea on paper but when actually attempted it was too unrealistic.
1	3	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	2	3	Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac.With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated @CAPS1.Y.C. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas.
1	4	3	In this excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was redesigning the building's original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use. The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with many obstacles while they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects idea for a mooring mast disapperead and it was then used for observation.
1	4	3	While constructing the mast to docs dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flamable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear. The obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were to great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes.
1	3	4	There were many obsticles the builders of  Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous.
0	2	2	The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets.
1	4	3	In the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles the builders and arcitect @CAPS2 many daunting problems For one thing a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building. The mast would add to much stress to the buildings frame work and cause it to colapse, along with the imense wind power. Another problem was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium to inflate there dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly Flammable. There was also a law that stated that airships could not @CAPS1 too low over urban areas One of the Final and most important reasons builders @CAPS2 obstacles was the constantly shifting wind due to violent air current. Even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast the back end would swivel around the mast along with the wind.
0	3	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia amidon @CAPS1 there was a few obstacles while trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building.The first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot. New York has alot of people in it and alot of buildings. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" They were very big so they needed enough room not to hit anything else.Secondly was safety. They had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the wind blew to hard it could swing it back into the building.Lastly the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of peoples heads is pretty serious. ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" If one was ever to fail it would probly kill someone. No one would ever get over what happened.
1	4	3	The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building. safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the Mooring mast and trying to dock Dirigibles on it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to over come where the weather, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot to do to the violent air currents, even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast the wind would push the back all the way around the mast. Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was that they feared that the lead weights that held the Dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building, leaving it unsafe for pedestrians and for the pilot and passengers on the blimp.
0	4	4	In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock.
1	1	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt. If something happened to fall, someone could get hurt. Another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That's the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for dirigible to dock.Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way.
0	3	3	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished.
0	4	4	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor @NUM1 out of 102.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building frame had to be strengthened. The weight of ""the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that the building's frame had to be modified, which costed @NUM1 dollars. Next, it proved to dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumputous sky-scraper. After the Hindenburg caught fire, ""the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" In accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers try to overcome was simply nature itself. Winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower.
1	2	1	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders went through many obstacles to get their @CAPS1 done.The builders thought they had every all set and under controll. when they had made their plans they had planed for the mist to be a big pice. when they had made the mist it just wasn't right. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Then they had more problems because a law was p being passed that the ships could not tie them self to the buildings they wouldn't have anyone visit the building. But they solved that problem by haveing the airplanes bring the passengers. Even though the builders went through many obsticle they still managed to get passed them.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building. Many obstacles came upon the builders.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed. 
0	2	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So that was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working with that it would have to of been a very dificult situation and chalenging to work on the building with it like that. Another obstacle I would have to say would be the wind pressure they had when the thouand-foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable that must of been a difficult obstacle with the wind blowing hard. Over sixty thousand dollers' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work must have been a challenging obstacle because they had to do alot of work that would take a while to get done if it has all over sixty thousand dollers' worth of work they had to do @CAPS1 on the frame work.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibels to dock there. The main reason the diriibles couldn't dock there was because the dirigbles load. The load would cause stress. The wind pressure also is another reason dirigbles couldn't dock there. ""The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The dirigbles were docked by means of an electric winch. The electric winch was fine but, it also says ""the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" this could have been a safety concern also.
0	4	4	In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire about New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safetly land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasnt the most logical idea.
1	3	4	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. for example it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying to low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, It's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just to great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature.The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad.The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building (@ORGANIZATION2) had many obstacles to face when building the mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. Top winds, the flammability of the foreign ships, and airspace laws all hindered the production of the blimp dock.Very high up in New York, the winds are dangerous. If a blimp tried to dock there, the back would be whipped around and could end up harming someone. Being that high up, that's dangerous.Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable as witnessed with the Hindenburg. When that happened, the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 thought it was too risky having those things flying over highly populated areas.There were laws made prohibiting low aircrafts over densely populated urban areas, so there could be no docking or they'd be breaking the law every time they did. That wasn't a risk the owner's wanted to take.The idea of the mooring mast was a very under- thought idea. Builders forgot the wind, flammability of Ships, and airspace laws would all end up stopping the mast's success. Now the @ORGANIZATION2 just has a long, useless pole on top of it.
1	4	3	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock their. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 even if they found a safe way to land dirigibles they would be breaking the law. Second, there were ""violent air currents."" When they tried to dock the dirigible on the building, it could not get close enough to it to land because of the wind. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is very Flammable. In a densely populated area. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been. As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the bilders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast wald add to much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to to with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting the back of the ship wald swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the Ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles.
0	3	3	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were very strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"". Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"". Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand foot dirigible held to it, so the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" @CAPS1, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS2, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which wasn't safe for the pedestrians on the streets below. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.
0	2	2	The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below. And since they had to do that The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation
0	2	2	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.
0	2	2	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would put immense pressure on the framework and the pressure even would have reached the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame work to make it safer would have been @MONEY1. Another obstacle was public expectations. The Building was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the safety risk involved.
0	3	3	The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at. Also as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face.
0	3	3	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros.
0	1	1	The first obstical came when the @PERSON1 builing had changed its height. They created the mooring mast and made the empire state builbing @NUM1 ft. higher. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Then with the new laws and the hindenburg that the mooring mast would not work-out. So the gave up trying to make it useful.
0	1	1	The obstacles the engineers faced were that Of Any @CAPS1 builder. You have to to think About how high is to high wind conditions, sturdiness of the frame, @CAPS2 And payroll for the engineers. Although Al Smith did not run into the @CAPS2 Problems he did have to rethink on the Mooring Mast on if it was agood idea. Putting An @CAPS3 Thousand foot @CAPS4 Dangling from a Building 1,250 feet in the air. Al Smith @CAPS5 a landmark for the U.S. But @CAPS6 Should'nt have put a non-usable Mooring Mast At the top.
1	1	2	In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building faced opstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall... The hight of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for.
1	3	2	The first obstacle that it faced with having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the mooring mast, The second is that dirigibles from other country's used hydrogen, wich is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason wich should have been apparent from the start was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is the wind conditions at that hight made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind.
0	4	4	The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects could'nt just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load & the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be another example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high force winds on top of the empire state building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe.
0	3	3	Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an oppertunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and archetects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning.
0	2	2	There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author states nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind on top of the buildings are dangerous for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Those were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there.
0	1	1	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable.
1	4	3	In the @DATE1's Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsAnother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties
0	3	3	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influentiel obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the Winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting."" This would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe.""Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies ""This law would make it illegal for a ship took even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1, the mooring mast idea was dropped.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. Most foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. A fire on the streets of New York would be disastrous. There were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it. Those three factors made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe.
0	3	3	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.
0	3	3	The workers on the Empire @CAPS1 Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall.It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project al ltogether was unrealistic so therefor it was a great challenge for workers docking dirigibles.
0	3	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attemting to allow dirigibles to dock there are safty and nature.                                                                                                                         Safty was an obstacle because most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium and because hydrogen is flammible it was not safe at all because it could have caught fire just like the ""Hindenburg caught fire in 1937 so the owners of the Empire state building saw how it was unsafe for the public and the building. Nature is another obstacle because the wind currents on the top of the building kept shifting because of violent air currents. Those are some examples of some obstacles the builders of the Empire state building had.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author stated, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" Dirigibles used hydrogen more often than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible were to catch fire or crash, it would be very dangerous over a populated area.Another obstacle was nature. The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would be too much for a dirigible to handle.A final reason stating why they couldnt dock was because it was against the law. The story stated, ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal to dock.The dirigibles faced many obstacles that didnt allow them to dock at the Empire State Building.
0	1	1	The obstacles that the builder's faced were @CAPS1 avoidable. The first obsticle they faced was the @CAPS2 landing space they had. If they had thought a little bit longer they most likey could of figured out a way to overcome that problem. Now a @CAPS3 a couple of obsticles to talked about the fate of the Mast. Everybody including Al Smith should have thought about the safty, it Should have been a first priority. The builder's Should have seen a problem like this coming, with a poor plan to build Something @CAPS4 has everdone before.
1	3	2	The builders were Building about @NUM1 ft high Above surface, so Safety is an issue. Then a @NUM2 ft @CAPS2 would moore, at the top of Building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building (@CAPS2 load would). Also, The Wind pressure would have to be transmitted @NUM3 ft below to the foundation. So its a @CAPS1 that could affect @CAPS3. The @CAPS2 could catch on fire on top of Downtown New York hurting @CAPS3 And its costing a lot of money @NUM4 Dollars.
1	3	2	In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there was many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing diriibles to land there. One of the obstacles were the safety problems. The drigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State building so they could be able to tie the dirible down. This put the diribles too close to the people. There was a law that that stated that airships can't fly to low to urban areas. There was a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey that they were trying to prevent from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem with that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow diribles to get close enough to tie down to the mast. There were many obstacles builders had to face that at the end it was not worth making the Empire state building a dirible dock.
0	1	1	In the novel the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Because in the novel it said ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This quote said that the dirigible would add stress to the building and @CAPS2 risk of colapsing.
1	4	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at @ORGANIZATION2 was law agaist airship flying too low. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes. The obstacles the builders of @ORGANIZATION3 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved.
1	4	3	This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible was a dream that would be hard-to-reach. The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president. ""Held by a single cable tether"" would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stress to too much. What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all the obstacles.
0	3	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone.
1	4	3	In the article, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest building. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith decided to create a ""mooring mast"" where dirigibles could land and become ""transportation of the future."" However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like New York City. Another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than down the streets. If the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control. Finally, it is illegal to have a airships flying too low to the ground and near people. By having a dirigible land on the mast, it would break the law. There were too many obstacles for Al Smith's idea to become reality.
1	1	2	In the @DATE1's people did not have technology like we had today, they didnt know what they were really even doing. when the architecks were builing The @CAPS1 state builing they had many problems. First they couldnt just drop a mast on there because as they said in the story the roof was not flat. Next it said a thousand foot drop would add stress to the frame and last they had to change the frame from steel to glass and they also had to change the roof. All in all men in the @DATE1's had a lot of work to do while building the Empire State Building.
1	1	0	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was. how to build the morring mast. how to atach the mooring mast to the frame of the Empire @CAPS1 Building.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock this included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 with the amount the dirigible @PERSON1 and the wind the buildings frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was high up @CAPS1 the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting"" in result the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2 obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings, close by the dirigible could be pierced and would also be dangerous for the pedestrians in the city.
0	4	4	The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building. Including the obstacles and the loss of interest in dirigibles was the result in the discontinuation of the project.
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Another obstacle was the buildings structure if the blimp had docked there would be stress on the building ""would add stress to the buildings Frame"". The last obstacle was the wind would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents
1	3	4	The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared.
1	2	1	Some obstacles were that there was many sharp rods on surrounding buildings and so if it touched one it could pop. Another is if the wind is blowing it was hard/unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building.
0	2	2	There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the empire state Building. One problem would be the foundation. If dirigibles were to land on the building it would cause tension on the buildings foundation, @CAPS1 squishing it down. The architects would need to have made adjustments to the Foundation in order for a dirigible to land. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked. when the ship would be docked, it would be a hazard because it would sway back and forth around the mast. Either causing damage or injury to people of New York.
0	3	3	After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	3	2	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add stress to the buildings frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, which the desinged a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would illuminated from inside. When they tried it the wind was to strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. They also couldnt due it because there was a law that airships flying to low over urban areas.
0	4	4	 There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (Lüsted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. The mooring mast idea, was now non-sense.
1	3	4	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes.
1	2	1	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it talks about the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey + how much dangerous it would of been over a highly- populated areas such as New York.
0	1	1	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1 gets very competitive. He wants to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. But then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction.
1	2	1	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle they had to face they had to add to more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floor. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor.
0	3	3	The obstacles; the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They delt with the frames and shapes, but theres other reasons that are not so physical.One of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. At the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Using the Empire state Building, where the blimps would be dangling high about pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was not safe.Another particular obstacle they faced was; an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law made it illigal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State building itself. The blimps couldnt lad on the flat roof of the Empire state building. The builders of the Empire State Building had alot of obstacles in front of them. Not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the @CAPS1 of politics and nature aswell.
1	4	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon Lüsted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building.
0	2	2	The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people.
1	4	3	The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared"".
0	3	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by author @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle the builders faced was the concern of the building collapein over time with ""all the weight of the dirigibles. They would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles."" @CAPS1 @NUM1 supports that obstacle ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame"". A second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizen just below the tall building. After german dirigible was on fire in Jersey they realized how serious they situation can become. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" These were two of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced.
0	3	3	In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was safety.  In paragraph @NUM1, it was said that ""most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium"", now hydrogen is highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", now thats niether practical nor safe. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it applies that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success in that.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened.An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety. After the fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, the builders were worried about the issues that might occur, especially when it takes place in downtown New York.Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents.The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building.The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunetly, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong.
1	3	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell. Also, for the dirigible to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.
1	1	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing. New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas.
1	4	3	In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.Their biggest concerne was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable""(Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1).  The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg which was destroyed in a fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1).Another obstacle was nature itself.  ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM3).  The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles.Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas.  ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM4).
0	3	3	Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire state building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the passage states that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthen to accommodate this new situation."" This would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State building still stood at the height of @NUM2 feet, the tallest building built.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out.
1	3	4	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the empire state building, because the building would surely collapse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". this would be very dangerous. The dirigible could @CAPS1 over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all. There are three obstacles that prevented the empire state building from allowing dirigibles to dock there.
0	2	2	Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refuled. Anxious, Al smith was very unsure of when the would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof. Another problem would be the violent wind currents. The fate of the dirigible had faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers then dirigibles.
0	2	2	The first obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lake of suitable landing area. Because some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City.The second was that there dirigibles had hydrogen in it and hydrogen was highly flammable. And the realized how much worst accident could have been if it had taken place in New York because this is where they were located. They had to re-think about they're plan. And another one was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
1	4	3	Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a great accomplishment for the city of New York. Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think of the hazards and for ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city.Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around.There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas. so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early @CAPS2 of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock.
1	4	3	Many obstacles faced the builders of Empire State Building. The biggest problem is The fact that it was illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in Urban areas, stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flamable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there like safety, nature, and existing law.  In the excerpt the author tells how many dirigibles use hydrogen which is very flammable.  That makes it very dangerous to dock them on the Empire State Building because they could get in an accident, and since New York is so densely populated it would probably harm many people.  People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible.  Another problem builders face was nature.  In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""  This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable.  According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe.  To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.  So that meant it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building.  Builders faced so many obstacles about allowing derigibles to dock on the Empire State Building it just wasn't meant to be.
1	0	1	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They added on hundreds of feet allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing with the Chrysler building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would reach 1,250 feet beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desprite to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even to create a landing spot for dirigibles. @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't work out as planned. Instead, the @CAPS1 assigned to dirigible passengers was made into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire States Building encoutered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the buildings structure. to fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg
0	4	4	The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2). Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4). The impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope but the moorings still looms atop the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been.
0	3	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, The builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to realize the causes and effects of docking dirigibles. over sixty thousand dallors were spent on modifications for the building. after fixing the structure of the building the builders found out the weather had interfered. Because of the high winds the dirigibles were constantly shift. There wasn't a safe way to control shifting. Their was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. another reason was, dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea.
1	1	2	The empire State Building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles.
0	4	4	During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One of these obstacles was to modify the whole frame of the building. ""A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt cleary shows that the builders would have to move around this to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation an obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, which actually happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg. Those were the obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles.
1	4	3	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.
0	4	4	From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low.
1	2	3	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph @NUM1 ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was the blimps used hydrogen which was highly flamibale. An accident would of been tragic because of the heavily populated downtown @CAPS1. Also nature proposed a big obstacle as well ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 there was an existing law against flying airships to low over urban areas.
0	2	2	Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the empire state building. Finally these obstacles were fixed, but those were the obstacles the builders fixed.
0	3	3	The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous. If they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, There were many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1. To allow dirigibles to dock their. One of their main obstacles the builders @ORGANIZATION1 was the frame work. They had to design it so the building could bear the stress of the dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use diffrent Steel. Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, hydrogen is highly flammable, The winds on top of the building were. Constantly Shifting due to violent air currents."" They would also be careful of pedestrians ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"". Those are just two examples of what the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1.
0	2	2	Based on the excerpt there are three reason's why there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These reason's were, one it was to close to the city and not high up (short). The second reason is because the wind spun the blimp around the mast. And the third reason is because German blimps were filled with hydrogen, if next to heat it would blow up. And @LOCATION1 blimps were filled with helium.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flamable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked.
0	3	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the architect and builders have to overcome very big obstacles while trying to make this plan of docking dirigibles work. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" With this enormous dirigible in the air and the wind blowing around would hurt the buildings structure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With all of the wind the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 to build a docking station the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building.
1	1	2	Based on the story it all started when they had build the empire state building and the workers should have knowned that the building was too big for the wind climate, up in the sky and plus when you make a building like that you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance.                         They faced problem's like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock a blimp attempted to land on the dock.
0	1	1	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planing.
1	4	3	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved.
0	3	3	In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire state building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire state building was neither practical nor safe."" Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegle for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast.
1	2	3	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was A mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile And realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obsticle the builders faced in Attempt to Allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not Allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they fased where the unsafeness of it All. The winds A that height Are constantly different And could cause the Dirigibles to move Around. Having Airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous As well As illegal.
0	3	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world thought that they knew the future of air travel: dirigibles.  In an attempt to keep up with The modern world, Al Smith, lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided top the building with the dirigible docking station.  Unfortunatlley, during the building process, the architects faced many obstacles that stopped them from completing the mooring mast.  One of these problems with the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building.  Another was the flamibility of hydrogen the gas used in inflating the ship.  But the biggest obstacle was nature.  The winds that the dirigible would be facing were very strong, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were put at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash.  A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships couldnt fly too low over urban areas.  Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, many obstacles stopped it from having success.
0	4	4	When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building is a mooring mast, he had no idea how obstacles they would face in a attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face.
0	3	3	Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building faced problems. The dirigibles waight and the wind pressure would add stress to the Building. Wich @CAPS1 to be transmitted more then @NUM1 ft down to the buildings foundation. Construction wasn't the only problem. Most @CAPS2-American dirigibles are held afloat by hellium wich is extremely flammable and if it was @CAPS3 over busy + crowded New York streets many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the pottential to push dirigibles Into @CAPS4 buildings, causing them to pop. The finall problem was @CAPS5 already implace wich didn''t allow low flying aircrafts. Builders faced Problems with Nature, @CAPS5, safety, and construction wich lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system.
0	1	1	When building a structer as big as the Empire state building and even having it dock a Dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. In order for It dock. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The building would have to be @CAPS1. All these problems must be taken into consideration. This would mean spending more money
0	3	3	@CAPS2 on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the architects "could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof." This would cause stress on the building, so the "steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened." Another obstacle the architects faced was a concern of safety. In the excerpt it says, "Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @CAPS1 the greatest obstacle was "nature itself." On the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. In the excerpt it states, "the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast." @CAPS2 on the excerpt, these are the many obstacles faced by the architects.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to us @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, @MONEY1' worth of modifications were made to the buildings framework, Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast.
1	2	3	In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, flammability, or existing laws.
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable"". A fire in one of these would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mask"", and could even potentially puncture the frame. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would of been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it dangerous, but aganst the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous. One of the grestest obstacle of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was niether practical nor safe. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building.
0	4	4	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire state building. The architects knew that the large mooring mass could not be simply placed on the building flat roof. Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains tha ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Because, the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arrose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fir at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because, the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher. Helium is more flammable. Lüsted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Lüsted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an impractical location for an airship dock. Finally by the late 1930s it was certain that the mooring mass would not fulfill its purpose because dirigibles had now given way to airplanes.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building.The nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind. One problem that comes from this is tangling the mooring cable. To combat this captains would have to use lead counterweights. These were highly impractical to use because they would hanging over crowded streets.Another problem was added stress to the buildings Foundation. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars.The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the disaster.
0	3	3	The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attatched to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there.
0	4	4	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obsticles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear.
1	3	2	In this @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 the builder of the empire State building faced many @CAPS2 during the building of the Empire State building.The @CAPS3 obstacle would be the wind. Because The building was so high And the more up the more Air and wind they had to stop landing or Drop off the dirigible. A dirigible is also a ballon or blump but there different because the dirigibles can be controlled by pappellers. Another reason was the @CAPS4 equpment. They didnt have the right equipment to dock the dirigible. So they @CAPS5 from letting them dock there ever again. They also @CAPS6 to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes @CAPS4 the balloon could fall on the civilizians.Those Are the reasons Why in the @CAPS1-""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 had to face problems with docking ballons.
1	1	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a morning mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The buiders had to modify the building. ""As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast with out any ornamentation, the architects designed a shinny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illinated frome inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the over all shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame let them use the mast efectly.
1	4	3	Builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, for docking drigibles, would add stress to the buildings frame and ""could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building. The building needed to be ""modified and strengthened"" to accommodate this situation. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flamable. Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, results would have been far worst. Builders greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the air ship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. In addition, due to an existing law against airships flying too low, dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
0	3	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added, stress to the buildings frame, The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders.
1	1	0	It @CAPS1 like a veryhard test for them because there trying to make an age of transportation with the thoughts of the pioneers. But once the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes for the building skeleton. They have framed the 85th floor the roof had to be completed before the framing.
0	0	0	The Empire state building faced different stage. They @CAPS1 to make it to be fixed a little bit. Because it was the tallest building at the time and they so @CAPS1 it a more famous.
0	3	3	The builders @CAPS1 many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. Firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships From ""flying too low over urban area's"" as explained in paragraph @NUM1. In addition to this legal problem, the builders @CAPS1 the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmited over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Because of this added weigh over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building as cited in paragraph @NUM2. Also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. In fact half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to legal, structural and logistical problems.
0	3	3	At sporting events, people have gotten used to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp. Now they are used for advertising but not many people know that they were once thought of as transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good idea for the Empire State Building's mast, however their were to many problems to make it a reality.
0	3	3	I've been to the Empire state building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) I would think that before spending @MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start.
1	3	2	The workers that were building the extravagant Empire State Building they went through several obstacle courses. One of the obstacle courses having the blimp sit on top of building. Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord it was appling stress to the build because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature. Since the Empire State Building was so high up the wind was excrushiating. The last obstacle they had to over come was the gas they used inside the blimps. If they used hydrogen which is a highly flammable substance, like the German blimbs it could of been bad.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building.
0	2	2	The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe. (@CAPS1 @NUM1)
0	1	1	There Are @CAPS1 things that Are worry Some About dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind As the passengers walked down A Gangplank"". This would be unsafe because As it sways, it could knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall.
1	2	3	The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One of the main causes was nature. Winds/air current was a big risk. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shall..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This was a problem that no one could fix, no one can controll wind. Another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation. These obstacles architects couldn't overcome, and the original idea for the project was soon forgotten.
1	3	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles.
0	2	2	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.
1	4	3	In the excerpt from ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, many obstacles are described from the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Thousands of dollars were spent on hopeless modifications to the building, in efforts to add a mooring mast to the top for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. These efforts however were unsuccessful. Two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety in nature. After a 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building ""...realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@NUM1, @CAPS2) and an existing law forbade low airships in urban areas. Also, the unpredictable winds provided workers with a very risky, dangerous situation in the end, although builders faced many obstacles during construction, diribles were never docked on the building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to add a dirigible docking station at the top of the building. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind could cause a serious saftey hazard by spinning the back of the docked dirigible around. Also dirigibles are highly flammable. If an explosion such as the Hindenburg took place at the top of the Empire State Building it would have been catastrophic. Attempting to moor a dirigible at the top of the building was not only dangerous: It was illegal. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2)The fact that mooring a dirigible was illegal and extreemely dangerous, was not the only obstacle that builders faced. It was also a daunting task. Builders would have to learn new technologies for operating the system at the U.S. Naval Air Station. After researching, builders reliezed that they would have to strenghen the frame. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (paragraph @NUM3) The obstacles the builders faced, proved to be enough reason to never use the mooring.
1	4	3	One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft.

0	3	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted theres alot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (@NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2). The last problem was the existing law aganist airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3). These are three reasons why in the excerpt ""The mooring @CAPS1"" by marcia Amidon lusted that there were alot of problems when trying to add a dock for drigibles.
0	3	3	Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks.
0	3	3	. The Empire State Building during it's construction was being planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be attached to. The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1). Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2). All of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why, the mast was unrealistic.
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Is that when the Empire State Building was conceived, it was Planned as the world's. Then the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second Street. and @CAPS1 Avenue in new york. Before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip. this dirigibles or zeppelin and the @ORGANIZATION2 was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station.A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable. This meant that if it was exposed to fire it would instantly catch on fire over the world's most populated city.Another problem that was faced with the amount of wind at the top of the Empire building. With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer. The wind would toss them around, pilots couldnt take their hands off the geers.These were just two of the many struggles pilots and architects had to face when docking a dirigibles at a mast.
0	4	4	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several obstacles on they attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza @NUM1 the author writes, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza @NUM2, it say, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza @NUM3 it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past.
0	1	1	Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architect could not simply drop a mooring on top of the building's Flat roof. Like it @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be eliminated from inside. With a step-back to imitate the overall shape of the building itself."" It @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 @NUM2.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the architects faced many reasons in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't put a mooring mast at first because it will add stress to the buildings frame. The architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they are doing. Before putting the mooring mast the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to have the overall shape of the building. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed. when putting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it didn't work out. When they tested it the dirigible didn't get close enough to tie it up. So in the future ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 did not work out.
1	3	4	Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards.
1	1	2	The obstacles the builders faced building the Empire State Building were; the safety, the time.The safety of building the top the Empire State Building got in the way because, it was so tall that it would be hard to lift up the glass and steel parts to the top. Another reason why it was unsafe because if some of the glass or steel part got pushed off the people down be low. Another reason is the blinps flying to close to the buildings and hitting one of them. Also the passengers going on and off of the blinp; they needed to find away that the passengers wouldn't get hurt.The time that they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was not long enough. ""it's on the level, all right. No Kidding. We're working on the thing now.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front was masted to the building the back would move around. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind.
1	3	2	In the excerpt from, ""The @CAPS1 Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building One obstical they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable @CAPS2 if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like New York. The main problem they faced was the nature itall. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" The dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous. These challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originaly planned
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. Lüsted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As Lüsted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning. As Lüsted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor.
0	3	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that it was unsafe. It was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. In the excerpt it says the greatest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building was constantly shifting and the back of the airship would swivel around. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over the urban areas. These are the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had faced.
0	2	2	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of the mast. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big aircraft on the small framed building. Also the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air. They needed to talk and consult with the U.S. Naval Air station because they were leaders in research of the dirigibles. Another obstacle the workers had to overcome was the law against low flying aircraft in @ORGANIZATION3. So those are some obstacles that the constructors of the mast had to overcome to build the mast upon the Empire State building in @LOCATION1
1	2	3	The obsticles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the Building Frame. The @CAPS1 obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was an issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. This became a safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for would have interfered with the buildings overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of diribles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1	1	2	The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in Building the tallest building, The Empire State building.
0	2	2	Al Smith had a vision; to create a site for modern travel. Smith faced many obstacles and persisted with hard efforts in attempt to bring his vision to life. The stress of a thousand foot dirigible would have been to much pressure for the original framework of the Empire State Building. Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to strengthen the buildings framework. In addition the builders had designed a mast the would be rocket-shaped, made with aluminum, which could accomadate the mooring arm, and the control machienery would be in the shaft; housing elevators and stairs for passengers on the dirigible. Another obstacle they had to face was the lack of floors that would serve as a boarding area for the passengers. They had begun to build additinoal floors with a glassed-in observation area and a boarding area. Although the mooring mast for the dirigibles was a fiasco, Al Smith and many architects tried to make all the modifications they could have to fulfill Smith's vision for what he thought was the Empire State Building's destiny
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was nature itself. According to the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would make it difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up, and even after it is tied up the wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast making it impossible for passengers to exit. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"". This is a very black and white problem against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A final, and perhaps greatest obstacle against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is safety. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This creates safety hazards not only passengers and employee's of the dirigible but also the densely populated area below, that is downtown New York.
1	3	4	The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles.
0	3	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since its a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life.
0	0	0	Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders faced. was that they had to go to the base of the building to make it taller. This is The obstacles that they faced.
0	4	4	Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to @ORGANIZATION2, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as shown in @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). In accordance with @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel, and using lead weights to counter this would be dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 could not even dock in December 1930 due to winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p @NUM4)
1	3	4	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law.     Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped.     Saftey, nature, and the law kept Al @CAPS1 dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
0	2	2	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work. One obstacle is their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long ase one thousand feet long which is equal to four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This would add stress to the buildings frame and to dirigibles moored up their.
0	3	3	The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York.
1	2	3	The Empire state building was destined to reach new limits that had never been met or even thought of in the world of architecture as described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 was determined efforts in building a mast not only set the Empire State building at the tallest building, at @NUM1 ft., though to also serve a useful purpose, was a radical dream supported with intuitive design and high goals. Unfortunately the reality in successfully completing this far reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose. The largest obstacle was ""... one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This along with the fact that violent air currents at such great heights required that lead weights weighted dirigible down to prevent from extreme movement, served as serious caution the safety of the highly populated New York City surrounding the Empire State building. As practicality in the hopeful moore mast diminished it became... ""desirable to post to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The use of the moore mast ""quietly disappeared"", concluding the radical dreams.
0	4	4	During the time of the @DATE1's many obstacles came into play to the architects building a dirigible dock for them to land on top of the Empire State building. The builders had to face situations with weather conditions of this dock. The Empire State building was so high ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The weather conditions that were occurring high above of this 1,250 ft building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves making the outcome unsafe. Builders also had to face the reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern of obstacles these builders constructing this landing dock would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerfull and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle to these architects making the dock of these dirigibles unsuccessful. The obstacles that were faced in constructed this dock came to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes"".
1	3	4	Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible.
0	2	2	The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constent worry. Wind shifts, is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its @LOCATION1, the next its @LOCATION2. On may 6, 1937, when German dirigible Hindenburg, caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the empire state building. over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic. Airships werent allowed to fly that low anyways.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had a few obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted in the,The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be only for show, so he gave it purpose; a dock for dirigibles. By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger. Although these obstacles can be overcome, the obstacle of mother nature herself, cannot.
0	3	3	The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success.
1	4	3	Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more.Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast.""The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building."" The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed. There were too many obstacles.
1	3	4	While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred. During the process of planning the @CAPS1 of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications.Several complicostions occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add Stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up. wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger.
0	3	3	In the nonfiction article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it gives information of the potential problems from the Mast. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling."" The builders had a lot to take in to effect they had height issues, frame and law issues. That they had to sort out.
0	4	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faceD many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework.      Another problem they encountereD, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell.      An alternate problems faceD by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyeD in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how unsafe it be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populateD area."" AnD so, builders were forceD to stop their work.
0	2	2	In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here. One example of this is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because its lacked of a suitable landing area, meaning it's to difficult for landing, it's not ment for docking. Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' This shows that the weather can change, and it will affect its landing. These examples show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders faced.
0	1	1	How safe is it to have a large dirigible @CAPS1 above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face will attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. For one thing the mast was not yet even said to be ready in this excerpt ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desireable to postponed to a later date."" The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even said to be relevantly smart.
1	1	2	In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason why the builders faced obstacles was because ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" An example is ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible moor would make the buildings frame bend and become weak. That is just one obstacle that the builders faced, but there is many more.
1	3	2	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea
0	2	2	In this excerpt the builders of the empire State building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use. I think They just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building.
1	1	0	The building had a steel framed body up to @NUM1 floors the glass windows to the 102nd floor. They had to also had to upgrade the building because the stress that gets put on from the blimps.
0	4	4	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made stronger to put the mooring mast on there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" It cost more than @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle was the law. ""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work.
0	3	3	In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire, the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land.The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. I was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt.
0	3	3	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was @CAPS1 Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking stations. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that banned the use of low flying aircrafts in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high. Almost @NUM1 hundred feet up the winds would have been very violent, and with the tailend of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also it was not safe because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen which was highly flamable, and if an- accident similar to the Hindenburg with fire occurred over in urban place like New York City it could have been very tragic. Lastly in order to build the mast builders had to re inforce the frame of the building so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure.
1	4	3	Many problems arised with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building for that the engineers did not account. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind. ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot.
1	3	2	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it.
1	2	1	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous.
1	2	3	There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Because The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also because the Empire State Building have's an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.
0	3	3	There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the consept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obsticale that was faced was the strutural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over @NUM1 doolars' worth of modifications,"" The final obsticale was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities prooved to be challenging obsticales
0	2	2	When building the Empire State Building the @CAPS1 wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings that it would not be succeeded by the chrystler building. It's original property was not to be a mooring mast. The empire state building had to be refraimed then the government banned aircraft too low then commercial airliners took over the avaiting industry. It was too dangerious for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents can blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the hindinburg.
0	3	3	In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan which included building designs and figure out problems they failed to see from the begginning.The first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the buildings frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what wold be on each floor. They even had to finish the roor before the mooring mast cold take place.The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the beginning. In building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible. Safety was the main problem. if a fire occurred, there would be a disaster. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this work, they couldn't get passed the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built.
0	3	3	During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as do the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be.
0	2	2	The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced a few obstacles during there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were the structure of the building. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would, ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The Steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new Situation.
0	3	3	The builders faced some problems such as weather conditions. The winds were violent from changing wind currents. Another was the law of how close an aircraft could be to a building. Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place. The builders would have to strengthen the buildings skeleton in order for it to work. This they did. Another problem is some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen. This makes them highly flamable. With others made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians. These are the problems they faced.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles in the course of bringing Al Smith's plans to life. One of them was ""air ships flying too low over Urban areas"" is illegal. If breaking the law wasn't a large enough obstacle, then the issue of New York citizen's safety also came into play. Most dirigibles were dangerous due to their flamability. So one wrong move could have killed many ""if it had [exploded] above a densley populated area""Another huge obstacle the came into play was the lightness of the dirigibles, that would allow it's rear to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only way to stop that would to again, put the citizens in danger.
0	3	3	Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flameable and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped.
0	1	1	The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building.One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building. Which was forty-six feet taller, than the Empire State. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.
1	2	1	The buiders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface it took alot of stress and hard work. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load.
0	4	4	Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles.
1	3	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation.  To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.  The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock.  During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires.  Those are several examples of what builders of the Empire State building had to face.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. It also was'nt safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it wont swivel around the mooring mast. Also sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frameworK. They were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the city. It must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there.
0	3	3	Now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's people were oblivious to the idea many failures and the obstacles the builders would face. One obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk. Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the Empire State Building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over @MONEY1 to create a frame that would be able to stand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were facing was that most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is very flammable. They were afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would fall down to densely populated city below. And there was nothing that they could do to change this. A third obstacle they were facing was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible be constantly moving around while passangers tried to get on and off, which would not be safe. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced.
1	1	2	Some of the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that they were docked by means of an electric winch, wihich houlad in a line from the front of the ship and then tied into the mast. Also the dirigibles body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open oservation platform. Finally the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equiment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.
2	0	2	The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was not away for the dirigibels landing to be convinient for all. The dirigibels have a very fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as big as four blocks of New York City, paragraph @NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibels were very big, and the building it self as well. The siz was a problem because the enormouse dirigibels woud not be landing in the right space. Having lack of time was always a problem because the building would not be completed on time. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" paragraph @NUM2. Holding back on the making of the buiding to meet with thouse people took away time. When there is something very high, and wide in the way there will be a problem.
0	2	2	In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in building a dock for dirigibles. One of the problems they faced was that the did not have suitable landing area. In paragraph six it said that it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours. Also they had realized that most dirigibles from outside the country used hydrogen insted of helium which was more highly flammable. In paragraph thirteen they said that an accident could have been worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area it would be desasterous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is very dangerous. the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a @CAPS1 threat. Dirigibles moored in open land feilds where they could be weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, this is neither @CAPS2 nor practicle. Constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obsticles than its architects would have hoped for.
0	3	3	When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to support the dirigible. After they completed this issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous to because some air ballons were made out of hydrogen which were flammable. If their were any issues, New York's population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue ... because it was so shifty a dirigble would be heavy in the back. Dangling above new york was very dangerous. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it. The @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low.
0	1	1	There are many obstacles with the docking of the dirigibes, for example in the text it talked about if the accident had taken place over @CAPS1 it would of been alot worse because New York is A populated city another obstacle was the height as mention in the text and any thing could happen at that height so those are some obsticles in the way of the docking of the dirigibes.
1	3	2	From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring Mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One example is most dirigibles from the outside the United States used hydrogen. The united States mainly used helium, witch is not flamable like hydrogen. Luckily the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. This made it unsafe for the pedestrians down below. these are the obstacles the builders had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.
1	3	4	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe.
0	3	3	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be to much. There Would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the buildings frame. The entire Steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fullfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the Ship would swivel around. They are meant to land on open playing feilds but using these at the empire state building Where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe
0	3	3	In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders had to fulfill many expectations and make sure everything was right, but while doing that they faced many obstacles. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle the builders faced was most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flameable. They realized how much worse it could be especially with a more populated area like downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With all of These obstacles the builders realized that this would not work.
0	4	4	In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock
0	3	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstactles in allowing drigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the safety of New York people. They could have used hydrogen and the dirigible could have caught on fire and landed somewhere bad. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast Another was there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared.
1	4	3	the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived.
0	3	3	The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without taking into account the weight of the dirigible, the building would surely have way too much stress forced on the foundation when it docked. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air is both a negative and a positive. The negative side to it is the fierce winds that would take control of the back of the dirigible. Above the many pedestrians in the city, this idea was quickly ruled unsafe. Lastly, it was filled with hydrogen, which, naturally, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and only added to the negative side of the project.
1	3	4	In the construction of the Empire State building the @CAPS1 faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occured, and flaws in safety. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another problem faced was the burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @CAPS1 eiven started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the @CAPS1 to solve. It would never make it from the start.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first imediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moured, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight, the building would need to be modified and strengthened. The builders were also worried about safety after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft are highly flamable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets. Lastly, there was a law existing stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building. The combination of these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building.
1	3	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop of the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely and against the law.
0	3	3	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.
1	2	1	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes.
1	3	4	The workers' constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foriegn dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to Violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building.
1	1	0	The obstacals he had was that the problems where never really solved and that had caused problems with the wind.
0	3	3	Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting the the dirigibles would be hard to control. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" @CAPS1 that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly. Those obstacles are @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.
1	3	2	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	2	2	There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing.
0	1	1	The builders of the empire state building made it possible for dirigibles to dock on the top of the building because it made the building A lot bigger than it was. It lost its position As the biggest and then got it back by creating the dock for dirigibles (Blimps)
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the constructors of the Empire State building faced many dificulties while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In every building or project there must the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State was that landing flamable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city.
0	4	4	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete.
0	3	3	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose.
1	4	3	While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it seemed. First, the balloon would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be modified, a lot of money would need to be spent. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). It was too risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons.
1	3	4	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. 
0	4	4	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, annanced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used.
0	0	0	The builders, faced
1	0	1	Base on the excerpt, the obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. My prodiction is he doesn't want it around because the Empire State Building is way to high and the blimps is like floating Right above it. Something may have, thats what I think Al Smith is worried about. My backup answer is the statement he said ""it's on the level, all right. ""No kidding"". We're on the thing now. One set of engineer here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast"" it seems like hes confused about the whole situation.
0	3	3	There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock.
1	4	3	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle the builders had to overcome was the winds were constantly changing because of the air currents. Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock on the empire state building was because many dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used Hydrogen which is very flammable. So if one blew up like it did in Lakehurst, New Jersey more people would be effected by it. Yet another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there is because they could use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp because that would be dangerous for the people below Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed is because of the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area. If a Navy captain was afraid of having his blimp poped then no one should be allowed. The last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships can't fly too low over urban Areas. Those with the obstacles the builders could never overcome.
0	2	2	The use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use.
1	1	2	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there Were things such as how to dock a dirigible to a bulding, feuling and Service, how to get passengers on and off as safe as possible, they also Should have thought about @CAPS1 a thousand foot dirigible @CAPS2 from the top of the building might do to its structure.The architects and engineers of the empire State building consulted with expert, letting people from the U.S. naval air station take a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast. (Which is the anchor for the dirigible) The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform.In all, over sixty thousand dollers worth of modifications had to be made to the builings foundation. And some dirigibles couldnt even dock
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" This quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work. To solve that problem, the builders could have weighed weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe."" This quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas. ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This quote explains the law about airships. Clearly, the builders had many difficult obstacles.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousand-foot dirigible adding stress to the buildings frame. Therefore, ""... have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1) @CAPS1, the builders face the obstacle of safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2. line @NUM3) The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature. As the winds were shifting at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles swiveled around the mast. Previous solutions; ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@NUM4. line @NUM3-5) were not safe with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM6. line @NUM7) this made it so the dirigibles could not even approach this area. There were several obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State building a docking station.
1	3	2	Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.  Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when constructing the mooring mast.
1	4	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly because of safety reasons. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, the dirigible would crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. It was illegal for the dirigibles to even approach the area because of how low they would have to fly. Mooring masts were impractical and ""never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.
0	2	2	The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a grand idea at the time of construction, but it had many obstacles to overcome The builders first had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the buildings steel frame. this would reinforce the building against the pressure a dock dirigible would create. Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low. Not to mention the fact builders were a thousand feet high. this idea presented many challenges.
0	2	2	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.
0	4	4	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, where at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, and the most advanced form of @CAPS2. The Empire State building was erected to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3). In addition a law for bid @CAPS2 from ""flying low in urban areas (para @NUM3). For these reasons the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles.
1	2	1	The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldnt be very safe have lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was built out of Glass which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldnt stop and went straight into the tower. Also the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work to well.
0	3	3	@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt "The Mooring Mast" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builder's of the Empire state Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was safety, nature itself and the law.Safety because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable and accident could happen like ""German dirigible Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.""nature being the second problem because violent air currents could shift the dirigible and cause damage and hurt pedestrians.Law being the last reason because there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building."" Which makes it quite pointless to have even built it in the first place.
1	4	3	From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. The strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared.
1	3	2	The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". Even though the building was not what it was suppose to be it is still one of the greatest of all time.
1	2	1	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second  Street. and lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid. The age of dirigibles. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Once the archietects had designed the mooring Mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton.

0	2	2	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it.
1	4	3	One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. Therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was there was a it was illegal for ""airships to fly to low"" over urban areas. It was illegal for it to ""tie up to the building. ""The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented.
0	4	4	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was figuring a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, @CAPS1 they had no past trials to refer to. In this project practicity and safety worked together. For example ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" @CAPS1 that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. This would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building.The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" @CAPS2 all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation ""the steelframe [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the buildings framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclucion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to dock dirigibles in their building.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project.
0	3	3	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.
1	1	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps.     In paragraph 6 the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle of his company. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" The buildings structure didn't really help the dirigibles much.
1	4	3	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared.
0	4	4	When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many @CAPS2. One of these @CAPS2 being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" @CAPS1, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" @CAPS2 plagued the construction of the docks.
0	1	1	While building the Empire state building people had to go through some obstacle to have it the way they want. They wanted Dirigibles to be able land/bord on the Empire state building. One of there obstacles was the use in New York City and a lack of suitable landing area. The other obstacle was a good one. The use of Dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful.
1	3	2	In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon Lüsted tell about the Empire State building, & it's enormousity. Although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" That's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast.
1	1	2	When they build the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea.
0	4	4	One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully.
1	1	2	To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof The stress from a thousand foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthend. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a steeped-back design that imitated the overall shapp of the building itself."" This rocket shapped mast would have four wings at its corners of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery. Finnally, when this was all completed the existing plans for the building were to be put in place.
1	2	1	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below.
0	3	3	Having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up so hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would put to much pressure on the building frame, another was the baloon it's self, besides the U.S. most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents."" It was also illegal to fly/hold or dock a air craft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State building brought many issues and delemas making it hard to carry out such a idea for such a tall building.
0	3	3	In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @NUM1 main obstacles the builders faced where, hydrogen being highly flammable. The second main reason was winds from nature itself. The last reason was the law against airships.The first main obstacle the builders were faced with was there was hydrogen and helium in the balloon and the hydrogen was highly flammable, so the builders needed to make a safe place for the dirigibles to dock. The second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself. The winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up or approach a building in that area.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but in the end Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes...
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the obstacles that the engineers never thought of, the Empire wtate building never became a dirigible landing.
0	4	4	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to build the Empire State Building for use of dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects and engineers faced was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (@NUM1) this was very dangerous because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle that was faced was that ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) even though the dirigible would be tied down to the mooring mast ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2) Another problem due to the winds would be that ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (@NUM4) A last example of an obstacle would be that there is a law stating that all ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM4) was illegal. Even if there wasn't a law making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM4) the attemption of even trying would be very dangerous to the people around and below it, and the building itself.
0	4	4	There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building relized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in @CAPS1 @NUM2. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldnt safly dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that reason.
1	3	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast I have seen how the builders of the empire State building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The empire State building was already standing in the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the buildings frame. They also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to be empire state building it had 102 floors. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building. They would break the law of airships flying to low in urban areas. So the empire state building was finished but you could not use it for dirigible's.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.
0	2	2	While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low.
0	3	3	Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles.
0	1	1	the obstacles the builder of the empire state Building faced were... When the were planning to build a mask for the Dirigibles. When they first tried to build it they figured out that the structure of the Empire State building could not hold the mask. The Empire State building had to souport both the mask and the Dirigibles. Then at the end of the story the figured out there was no way to do it. That was one of the obsticals.
1	4	3	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. A large dirigible moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building, and ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" had to be made to accommodate the stress. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. According to the article, dirigibles could be weighted down to prevent this, but it is to unsafe for pedestrians. There was also the issue with docking dirigibles that use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In May 6, 1937, a hydrogen dirigible was destroyed by fire and according to the excerpt, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if the accident was at downtown New York, it would have made the densely populated area to unsafe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for there were too many obsticles for such an accomplishment to be made.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles.
0	3	3	Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuesly move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 to dock due to the unavailable route of save entirence. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas.First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, which would cause a bigger fiasco.Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger, making this idea impractical.Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law.In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas.
0	3	3	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: @CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. one of the obstacles were the crowded @CAPS1 they had for the dirigible. crowded @CAPS1 can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put alot of tension on the building and something could go wrong.
0	1	1	The obstacles, the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed 185 foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By @DATE1's the new airships called dirigibles was hailed as transportation for the future. They was like blimps but was filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New york city they had a lack of Suitable landing area for dirigibles. Al smith add a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from infront of the ship.
0	0	0	The problems that the Building had to face the could not unsolve the problem of mooring air ships to fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear.
1	3	4	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast.
1	1	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects made the Empire State Building more dirigibles. The architects put the thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building that is held by the cable tether. The dirigible's have to go through the wind pressure which was about eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the Empire State Building have to be strong and it cost more than sixty thousand dollars of modification to made the building's framework. The architects changed the design and made something new. The architects have a difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building is to make it dirigibles.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen. One of the obstacle was that buildings foundation had to be modified. In the story it says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."". Being so high the dock would be moved around because of the winds. Also the blimp itself could not even attached itself to the dock because the winds wouldn't let it. In the end the dock wasnt meant to happen it came with a lot of problem for the builders and even the artitechs.
0	3	3	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include, poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area.Due to the poor designing of Al Smith the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it.

0	3	3	The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical.
0	3	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City.The problem of hydrogen gas came to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey, then the owners realized how bad it could've been in the city. When it comes to high winds the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building
1	2	1	the mooring mast of the empire state Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have apparent before it was ever constructed the greatest reason was one of safety must dirigibles From outside of the united states used hydrogen. hydrogen rather Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken Place above densely populated area such as downtown New York
0	2	2	Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself.The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the @CAPS1 building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind.
1	2	3	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast.As for the building the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building they had to find another way, they did not want to put stress on the buildings frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was haulted due to danger of pedestrians, all that work for nothing.
0	2	2	In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obsticales to deal with. They had to make sure the dirigiles good go high enough and be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to deal with alot.""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof."" Because of the buildings hight they were uable to make things work. The dirigible was too much and it added stress to the buildings frame, to unload things it was to difficult the floor it needed to be on was too low.""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the Final the final instalation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time. The workers were devistated.
0	3	3	Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a city like New York. Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them.
1	0	1	The empire state building was the building designed to be the world's tallest building. With this the governor Al Smith wanted the building to be more than ornamental as he says in his comments in paragraph three.Al Smith wanted the Empire State building to be equipped for an age of transportation. He wanted to create the latest attraction for the dirigibles. Which was to allow dirigibles to dock there. yet allowing this, little did they know that builders would face obstacles.With the idea of the Dirigibles, Al Smith Saw a great opportunity. When he was asked about the Mooring Mast idea AL Smith Said, ""It's on the Level, all right. No kidding. were working on the thing now."" Although the Mooring Mast of the empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, as explained on paragraph thirdteen.
0	2	2	The following are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable and considering the disaster The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building which would puncture the blimp shell.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to dissappear.
0	1	1	The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (Lüsted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (Lüsted)
0	3	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws.Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch on fire above a very populated the city the outcome would be bad.The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing. It was not safe.There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it.The builders of the Empire state Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	2	2	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.
1	2	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders had to face was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the dirigibles. The single cable tether that would hold the dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders had to come up with a new idea that would not put stress on the Building. Another obstacle the builders had to face is it would be safe for the passengers. Since the building is so high up the fear of falling out of the dirigible made them worry. One last obstacle that the builders had to face is the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" it made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast,, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faceded, to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problemb was the modifications that had to made to the buildings framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this product was going to be. A second potential problemb was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consiquence feared by the piolet of Los Angeles. Another problemb brought up by the winds shifting, would be the ship spinnig, potentialy resulting in catastrophe. They acomidated for the use with unpractical things, eventualy leading to the downfall of the mooring mast.
0	3	3	The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock.
0	3	3	There are many problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German dirigible called the Hindenburg that caught fire due to the hydrogen. Having a dirigible go up in flames over dense New York would result in many lives lost. Second, the wind 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable. There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it. Since these problems all could result in deaths, the idea was thrown out.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating.
1	2	1	In the excerpt  The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified in strengthened and to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, @LOCATION4, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds in using lead weights to weight the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.
0	3	3	Builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting durables be able to dock there. Some of these obstacles weren't caused by the building it self, nature took part of it due to the forceful winds at the height of 1,250 feet it was hard for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ship close enough to tie it up. This situation occurred to the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" fearing the wind would blow the ship onto Sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Witch would cause the shell to get punctured leading to a disaster the captain failed to attempt to reach the building on december 1930. Another obstacle builders faced was that an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas witch would put civilians on the street at risk. Another obstacle was not a large enough dirible would put stress on the buildings frame.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When it says in the passage, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" this means that the architects would have to modify and strengthen the building for a ""thousand-foot dirigible"" to land there. Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around, which would be dangerous. The architects came in contact with many problems.
0	1	1	The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. The builders first talked about such as Al Smith to try to make the Empire State building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great forefront for travelers, and they got it up high to @NUM1 feet. But now there obstacle was to have a dirigible reach the top point of the empire state building. Al Smith wanted for the top of the empire state building to be a landing area, where they could go refueling for hours, or service, and to let passengers on or off the dirigible. So that was one of the obstacles that the builders had to face, to make it work.
0	3	3	In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were comming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shiffting caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. The builders should have relized all the hazards. They were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the moorning mast for dirigibles and their passengers.
0	2	2	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building.
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were accidents over densely populated areas, violent air currents constantly shifting, etc.
1	4	3	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, is informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them.
1	3	2	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place.
1	2	1	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building.
2	1	3	While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's. Many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock dirigibles. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's. So then by the late 1930's, the idea of wing transportational diribles faded away. Later on they took passengers baggage of dirigible and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden.
1	2	1	some of the obstacles that the builders faced while allowing dirigibles to dock there would be that they had a lack of suitable landing area. one of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature. the shifting of the Air Currents were constanily shifting. the back of the ship was constanily shifting.
0	3	3	The builders faced multiple obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature played as a big obsticle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe enviroment. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building.
1	2	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One is the stress on the building from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all they way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" @CAPS1 how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into issues which eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen.
0	4	4	The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building, had to face many obstacles. First, the girigibles were similar to huge ballons, @CAPS1 they were composed with hydrogen and helium. In the expert it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (pg @NUM1.) @CAPS1, if a dirigible caught on fire while it was stationed near the Empire State building, it may also catch the Empire State Building on fire. Resulting in a hazardous environment for the employees, and passengers.Next, attempting to tie down a dirigibles to a building, is known to be illegal. On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."". If anyone disobayed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with.Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe. ""The @CAPS2 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted gives an excellent third reason why airships are unsafe, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" If a disaster ever took place, many lifes would have been lost or severely injuried. Finally, the builders and architect would have an extremely hard time convincing high government officials to allw air ships to dock on the empire state building, because the bad certainly over powers the good.
0	2	2	Al Smith was a guy who had an idea of making the world tallest building, and he didn't give up. In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building, goal height would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted transportation to involve.The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was the lack of landing area. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.One of the greatest obstacle to let the dirigibles docked there, was the weather. The dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, where it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street. It was also an existing. law against airships, flying too low over urban areas.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above the densely populated areas such as downtown New York.    The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights.       The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In addition to these obvious set-backs, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" However, it is safely said that mother nature herself proposed the biggest obstacle for the builders. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles securely and safely hoisted to the building. The obstacles for the builders also became much more dangerous as they began to realize the science of the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", caught fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey the owners and builders of the Empire State Building realized that the accident could have been much worse if it happened on top of one of the most populated cities in the world.
0	4	4	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that they needed a mooring mast so that the dirigibles could anchor, but they couldn't drop a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building's roof. It would put too much stress to the building. This problem cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was safety precautions. The dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below. One other obstacle that the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they tried to anchor a dirigible on the Empire State Building, it would be illegal. Due to all of these obstacles not getting results, the whole idea has disappeared.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framewor The greatest obstace of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.
0	3	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the empire state Building had to be modified and strengthened to accomodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mase causing it to not be safe.
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural @CAPS1, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods. The structural @CAPS1 was a quick fix, by reinforcing the supports to the building itself.
0	2	2	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigble moored at the top of the building help by a single cable tether would have stressed to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted All the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" @CAPS1 are the main obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock
1	3	2	Problems the builders of the Empire State Building cam across were some tricky, life threatening ones. The first being as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. When it explains that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong and it caught on fire, their would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" in paragraph @NUM2. the fact that the wind a top of the tower would be whipping the dirigible around with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. Not making it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast, was that no airships flying low could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3. Those are some of the problems the builders had to face if they wished to dock dirigibles on the building.
0	3	3	allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building.one of the main problems was it was flamable. The helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. If there was the smallest spark the entire Dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example The hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. So the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York it would of been much worse.Another problem with the dirigibles was wind. If there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. aqlso it is weighed down by the lead by lead weights. If it is over pedestrians It is not safe.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles to allow dirigible's to dock there. What these builders were facing was a thousand foot derigible moored at the top of the building, the height of the Empire State Building is 1,250 ft. Adding the single cable tether would add to much stress to the buildings frame, the workers would need to modify and strengthen the buildings frame. Another problem they didn't realize at first was the wind, from violent air currents. With all these problems that were not easily fixed, eventually the idea of a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building dissapeared.
1	2	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents."" Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without blowing away. Another obstacle was safety. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea, there are too many obstacles and hazards preventing it from ever happening.
1	3	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there.
1	4	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would have put too much stress on the buildings frame. They had to transmite the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building. They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building.Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in. But even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast.Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So now the ships couldn't ever approach the building to tie off to the mast.
0	3	3	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this. Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles In their attemt to make a dirigible docking station.
0	3	3	In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles. The dream was not ment to be.The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, docking station, on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable.The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes. These would hang above the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed.
1	3	2	Trying to allow dirigibles dock on the Empire State building caused way to many obsticals for the builders. Dirigibles were up too one thousand feet long, this would make it realistically impossible for it to dock because the size of it would add stress to the buildings frame builders would have to reconstruct and make the frame stronger. Most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and not hellium which I highly flamable if cought fire pedestrians could be seriously hurt. Finding out later they an existing law about airships flying to low which would make it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State building
0	3	3	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic.
0	4	4	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges.
0	4	4	Builders of the empire state building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock their ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself"" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because they could not get close enough to the building to land. The winds were too strong. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be that low. Lastly dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather then helium ""hydrogen is highly flameable"" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happen above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late; before the construction, is why the dirigables are not allowed to land on the Empire State building to this day.
0	4	4	In an attempt to allow dirigibles, otherwise known as zeppelins or blimps to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles along the way. Al Smith stated ""... engineers here in New York [are] trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement"" (paragraph @NUM1). First, they would not drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This would add too much stress to the frame and it would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen, which is very flammable. When the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, ""the owners... realized how much worse that could have been if it had taken place above a densly populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM3). The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM4). Due to violent air currents, ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting"" (paragraph @NUM4) in open areas, dirigibles could be weighted down by lead weights, but this poses a threat to pedestrians on the street, as the weights would be dangling above them. Lastly, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM6). This law makes docking at the Empire State building illegal The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	4	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?
1	3	2	In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The first obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified. The excerpt says, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle was safety. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle. Shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets. Finally, at the time there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles are were the architects of the Empire State Building from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world.
0	3	3	By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-desgning of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over @MONEY1 worth). Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe.
1	3	4	Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast consumed over @NUM1 thousand dollars and much time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, The greatest Obstacle was just nature itself.
0	4	4	Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation.
1	3	4	The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were all a matter of public safety. They should have reallized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"" and that they were thus prone to exploding. In an urban city like New York, a thousand foot dirigible that would cover four blocks would cause immense casualties. Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been reallized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Docking in an urban setting proved too dangerous to risk.
1	3	2	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast.
0	3	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. First, there was the matter of safety. If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous. It could start a huge city fire. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea. The plan was dangerous from the start, albeit a really awesome one.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there.
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practicle. Having an up to @NUM1 foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.
0	1	1	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stay up. The builders had difficulty getting the building to how they want it. They kept adding to the building and making it taller. The dirigibles needed it to be bigger so they could see it. The problem was that it kept on breaking or something would go wrong. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail. They had to make their plans realistic and that was there major problem.
0	4	4	Mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the Empire State Building. One of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the Hindenburg exploded, it would be to unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as New York City.Another obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem. This was the biggest problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph @NUM1). If the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. This could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building.The last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. The exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area. This made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles.
1	3	2	During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building.
0	2	2	The obstacles that builders faced at the empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there are. The possible dangers of having something fall on them. The hydrogen is highley flamable so the dirigible could blow up and ingor any one aroud it. The empire state building may not be strong enough to withstand the the moving of the @CAPS1 the back side moveing so much from the dangorouse winds, so the @CAPS1 could possibly pull off part of the building and could @CAPS2 nearby pedastrians.
1	3	4	The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (¶ @NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" (¶ @NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (¶ @NUM2) the architects should've thought their plan through better.
0	2	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh. The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. So in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done. Then realizing the idea was not pursuable.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many natural oposition in attempting to allow derigibles to dock in the building. Nature forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State building: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around and around the morning mast. Other oposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flamable and risked the life of the people who lived around the Empire State building. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibet airships to fly too low over the urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships in the Empire State building illegal. The builders of the Empire State building confronted both natural and social oposition to the landing of the ships in the Empire State building.
0	3	3	During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's @CAPS1. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame."" Another obstacle in the way was nature itself. The reason was that the winds on top of the Empire State Building was always changing because of violent air currents. This was dangerous because ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2, there is a law in the United States against airships Flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the [Empire State Building] or even approach the area. Many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State @CAPS3, but that didn't stop the workers from doing their job.
0	3	3	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared.
0	1	1	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build it. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it. And made sure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles is heavy. Hydrogen might be make it broken. Nobody know what will be happen when dirigibles fly on the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind. Perhaps out off controll.Which floor can we put the mast is also really important. I think no one like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream.
0	3	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area. Also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous. Lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas.
0	2	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was to fast for the builders at that altitude. This shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below. Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building a bad idea to dock a dirigible.
0	1	1	They could not put a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building.
0	1	1	During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had know idea. They did have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then.
0	1	1	The builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 threw many obstacles. They consulted with experts taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The builders also had to meet with the president of a formed airship transport company.
0	4	4	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.
0	2	2	Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action.
0	2	2	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles.
1	2	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the expectations that people had for it. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State building builders were trying to make a reality. The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Then when a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse it could of been it happened in a place such as downtown @CAPS1"". It is a good thing they did not do the idea.
0	3	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles. One of these obstacles was that dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium. Using hydrogen was highly flamable. They knew how dangerous it was. In the excerpt it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the dirigible. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not dock over a heavy populated city like New York City. Many obstacles made it challenging to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over @NUM1 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation.
0	4	4	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced the obstacles of safety, nature, and law in attempting to dock dirigibles atop the empire state building. First, it would not be safe. In the excerpt it stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a densely populated area such as New York, they couldn't risk having a dirigible burst into the flames and cause massive chaos. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. They could've taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low. To conclude, the obstacles faced by the builders of safety, nature, and law could not be overcome to get the mast up and working.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building. They faced obstacles like laws, saftay problems, and also natural problems when trying to successed this gutsey idea. They firsted faced the problems of law, ""An existing law aginst airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The Second problem was dealing with saftey, ""when dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed... Owners of the Empire State building relized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York."" After blimps were proven to be highly flamable the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be worse than a rural area. Finally the builders face problems with nature, ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The builders relized that the drastic change in @LOCATION2 at the top of the building where not apperate for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that a-rose.
1	2	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with, while in the process of building a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the hight of the building. That ment more frame work, more material, more safety hazards, all because of the buildings hight. Another obstacle was @ORGANIZATION3 safety. After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that, ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"", wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was a accident, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also wip the backend of the dirigible so it would be unsafe and  unsturdy for passengers. These are some of the obstacles builders had to face while building the famous mooring mast.
1	2	1	In the excerpt the builders had wanted dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. They found that they couldn't do that because the winds would push the dirigibles in all different dirrections. And also there was a law that air crafts had to be a certain height in the air.
1	2	1	The obstacles of The @CAPS1 of Them Empire state building were some big ones which led to some Problems. for @CAPS2, There was a lack of a, Landing area for the Dirigible. But the @CAPS3 reason was the lack of saftey there for This dream could Not be accomplished.
0	3	3	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields.
0	4	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, both during construction and after. During The creation of the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building, because the stress of the load and wind pressure would add stress to the building's frame; instead, they had to transmit the load and pressure to the foundation, modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. Builders also wantd the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, needing to make the tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside. After the creation Of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen-using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire as a result. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents. Dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast  Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would be illegal, therefore, for a dirigible to tie up to the building Or even fly too close to the area.
0	2	2	In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to strengthen and modify the whole building which cost over sixty thousand dollars. So they build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Those were the obstacles in making a moor mast.
0	3	3	In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the @CAPS1. One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacale contractors would need to reinforce the @CAPS1 of the frame and the foundation. And the obstacle as stated from the excerpt is ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" @CAPS2 that hydrogen is flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York. Those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
0	0	0	The obstacles the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. So people can get off and unload or load up their ship.
1	4	3	The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders faced. The ""violent air currents"" would cause dirigibles to move around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered. Another obstacle faced, was that the architects couldn't just add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Lastly, as stated in paragraph thirteen, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable. When the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went up in flames, the owners of the building realized the dangers of this.
0	4	4	From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe. Because of all the obstacles the Mooring Mast would never be used
0	3	3	As it was the idea of a dirigibles dock was quite far fetched THe first problem thay encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the empire state building would cause a great strain on the buildings framework, @CAPS1 they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen which is extremely flammable, also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" making the idea of a dirigibles dock extremly to risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock.
0	2	2	Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obsticals came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole building. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, the shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstical that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the Empire State building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add amounts of stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstical that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U. S. Used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything to happen it could destroy New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced my obsticals in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1.
1	1	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacle wer't successful using the mooring mast and the nature itself. But after the celebrating they were disappointed because the dirigibles wasn't able to dock there. After that another dirigible the @CAPS1 year blimp Columbia, attempted a Publicity stunt where it would fly up and deliver a bundle of news papers to the Empire State Building. when the stunt wan't success the blimp could be use for transportation in the Future.
1	2	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.
0	2	2	In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author told the readers that after building the Empire State Building the builders had to reconstruct the entire building having to make is stronger to support the top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These are just some of the many hardships the workers had to face.
0	2	2	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building and encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like @ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles.
0	1	1	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is one paragraph @NUM1 ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.
0	4	4	There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast
0	2	2	The builders had to face alot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldent just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State. A Dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add alot of stress to the buildings frame. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be upgraded and strengthened. Also all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the buildings framework better.
1	3	2	When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose.
0	3	3	The Mooring Mast, authored by @PERSON1, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems.
0	2	2	Most dirigibles from outside of U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey, On May 6, 1937, the ownes of the Empire state Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated area such as downtown New york.
1	4	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building realized quote how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes is so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle of all however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below. All of these factors contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York.
0	4	4	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications.
0	3	3	In the 1930's the world was evolveing and new technology's were comeing of age. One of these tecnology's was the Dirigible and some people thougt to expand it's use. One of these idea's was the moring mast on the Empire State building. This was a great idea but the things that stood in it's way made it impossible. A major problem was the safty, consdiring it was 1,250 feet up. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crass into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off corse. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have bee looked at from the beging was law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airship's flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 this moring Mast was a fantastic idea, there were to many things standing in it's way.
0	1	1	Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, and rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast.
0	3	3	The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated.
1	3	4	The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 ft. above round over the city of New York not shockingly posted a few obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.Before the dirigibles could even try to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the whole building due to the stress and pressure on the building from the dirigibles. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building once the builders finally had all the modifications and building done; they were faced with a whole new set of obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the united states were filled with flammable hydrogen. ""The german dirigible @CAPS1 was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey"". This accident worried @CAPS2. Also they faced problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it difficult to dock the dirigibles. Another obstacle was the fact that laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the idea of docking on top of the building disappeared.
1	2	3	In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their attemp of allowing dirigibles dock on the mast of the Empire State Building.First of all, the dirigibles were big and heavy and needed space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the building, they would need a lot of space to build a big landing platform for a safe landing.Secondly, the decided that they could not land dirigibles on a flat roof and decided to tie it with a cable tether. The authors says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the buildings structure and that the strong winds could cause damages down to the foundation of the building.In conclusion, the workers faced many obstacles in order for them to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the State holding.
1	3	4	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the @DATE1's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.The attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.
1	4	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted.
0	4	4	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle the builders had encountered was the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States. Hydrogen is considered highly flammable, a big safety issue. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York."" (@NUM1) If this had occurred in New York the damage could of been a lot worse.Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) this is very dangerous because of pedestrians on the street.The final obstacle was an already existing law that prohibits airships flying low over urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building."" (@NUM3) this law would not allow dirigible to approach New York. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the owners of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents and existing laws in attempting to allow dirigible dock at the building
0	2	2	In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire @CAPS2 building faced many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. For @CAPS3, the author said ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transnitted all the way to the building's foundation. This shows that not only did they have to designed to take the load of the building but also the dirigible. Moreover the author stated that, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether. The engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt In all the engineers that designed the Empire State building had to over come many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first problem was the frame of the building. The frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so the had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present. The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. A couple of attempts have been made but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. 
0	2	2	The Empire State Building started out as a huge sky-skraper. Then Al Smith had to get all competitive and put his crew to full work. The crew had many obsticles to fufil. First off, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Second the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower, illuminated inside. next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm.  Fourth the crew has to add stairs and elevators to accomidate the ""blimps"" passengers.  And lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the @NUM1 and 102 floors.  Smith's men worked hard and over came many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building
1	3	4	In this excerpt the Architect/Workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find away for this huge mast not to kill the building frame The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" They had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" To fix this Architects and Workers must modifie the steel frame because of the new situation. After this was built and done they had to face the facts that this was imposible to do or not allowed. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects and worker went through so many obsticales to then find out its dangerous and the law not to fly so close to urban area's.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One main reason was that it was illegal for dirigibles to dock. ""Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", @CAPS1 @NUM1. Also mother nature prevented dirigibles ability to dock there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930 the U.S. Navy, Los Angeles tried to dock, but due to the severe winds could not. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the city could cause a huge threat. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there. A main set of problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock. The builders had to modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device. The builders were faced with legal and safety problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
0	4	4	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Lüsted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lüsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful.
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" various obstacles were faced in the challenge of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast. The first challenge the builders faced was that of nature. ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" (@NUM1) The violent winds that high up would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably, making it unsafe. Another problem arose when the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) If a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below. The last obstacle was a law. ""...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the Empire State Building. In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems ar ose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas.
1	3	4	The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" @CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project.
1	2	3	When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles.  An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldnt fall off when a dirigible docked.  They couldnt use cable.  tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the building's frame and foundation.  Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame.  In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face.
0	2	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building is that they Could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law agains airships flying too low over Urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped.
0	4	4	During the construction of the mooring mast a top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some obstacles. One obstacle that they faced was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, they had to do some work on the building, so it could support it. As the @CAPS2 said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation"". Another obstacle the builders faced was that if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous, because there would be many more people nearby, who could get hurt by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the @CAPS2. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians... neither practicle nor safe"". The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los angeles. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast hasn't been used since.
0	2	2	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable land area. Another Obstacle they faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. They also had to make shore that No sharp objects would punkener the dirigibles. These are the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire state building faced.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top @CAPS1 ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the dirigible to dock at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This set the builders back again because even if they did find a way to dock the dirigible the Empire state building would need ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" Even though that's possible there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders faced many obstacles that set them back but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true.
0	3	3	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.
0	2	2	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important issue was the Mooring Mast. According to @ORGANIZATION2, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (paragraph @NUM1) Another problem would be the dirigible's load. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (para. @NUM1) One of the main things the architects forgot to take into consideration was the buildings frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""(para. @NUM1) The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigibles on the ground, but in mid air it was almost impossible. Another reason was it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a law against airships from from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles.
1	0	1	Technology was not caught up to the dirigibles. they could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the righ equipment and that was one of the obstacle that the builders of the Empire State building faced. For @CAPS1: when they have to delivery the newspaper.
0	2	2	The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This is one trouble they had because if the dirigibles ever was an acident abuve New York City it would be bad because New York is so poluted.Another problem was"",they could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the empire State building's Flat roof."" This was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing. lastly another problem was the compotition, ""Al Smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building. Al Smith was so caught up in his desing he did not relize the compotition. So when he found out he knew had to make his taller.
1	3	4	Throughout the story workers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacles they faced was trying to ge a thousend foot drigible mooring at the top of the building. This was held together by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the buildings frame. All the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, but that was eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable. If a dirigible was ever destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing so would be very difficult to land. The last obstacle was it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas.
0	3	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders experience many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the builders cannot just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable teather, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock. The largest reason why the dock didn't work out was safety. The author writes ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" This means that the dirigibles are highly flameable and if one exploded over the densely packed New York it would have serious reprocusions. All of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State building.
0	2	2	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced many obstacles. The main issue that was not noticed till the end; was that it was an enormous safety problem. The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic! Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down. Using them in a city dangling over pedestrians would be neither practical, nor safe.
0	3	3	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.
0	2	2	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, They had to build @CAPS2 planfronts on the side of the building, which means that they would be putting there life's in danger. They also had to deal with the electrical  problems within and without the building. The @CAPS1 on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly. If there were to be a stark of any sort of Fire, the hydrogen and helium were extremely flameable, and if a wire were too short, it could like the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up.
1	4	3	When builders were building the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was lack of suitable landing area in @CAPS1 (paragraph 6). Al Smith came up with the idea to put a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to land there, but there was many problems with this mooring mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) architects had to strengthen the building's foundation. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent to try and modify the buildings framework. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (paragraph @NUM2) The winds were shifting and the back of the ship would swivel around, which was not safe. Another reason is that airships flew too low over urban areas. Having a mooring mast for dirigibles to land was dangerous, going against some laws, and a lot of work.
0	3	3	The builders of the empire state building faced alot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to let allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before @CAPS1 they didnt know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. At first Al smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, technology of the future, but things werent that easy. They faced complications with the @ORGANIZATION1 with there research on dirigibles. It was a complicated process because it was @CAPS1 high up in the air, and there was alot of practicing involved. Next was the alterations made to the building, the building wasnt strong enough to hold the dirigible @CAPS1 they make @MONEY1 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldnt be good with the highly flamable hielium, @CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying to low at or over urban areas, wich would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building. And the top floors were turned into soda fountain.
0	2	2	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the @CAPS1 had to fix the frame of the building in order to transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the @CAPS1 had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the empire State building and not stick out.
1	0	1	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when al Smith realized that he was close to Not winning the world's tallest building. It talks about it in paragraph @NUM1. Then he annonced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. That's an obstacle because without the building he cant make the dirigible, and he always wanted compitition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible.
1	3	2	In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, obsticals of the Empire State Building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. Those are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.
0	3	3	In the short story of ""The Mooring Mast."" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes three obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced for the attemption to allow dirigibles to dock there. Two resons were safty. The first ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". A flammable ship above a ""densely populated area such as dowtown New York could result in desistiar. The second safty reson was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifing due to Violent air currents."" Dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither Practical nor safe."" The final obstacl the Empire State Building faced was Law. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" ""This Law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the buildings or even approach the area."" The Law and to safty obstacles the builders of the Empire' State Building faced would not allow any attempts for dirigibles to dock there.
0	2	2	When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building he wasnt really thinking straight. That was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lifes going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasnt thinking about safety things and just was going for looks. The obstacles he would encounter words death from idiots that would go up there, weather, and @CAPS1. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy it could through the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The @CAPS1 to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station. @ORGANIZATION2 wasnt in a smart guy for letting dirigibles for landing.
1	4	3	Builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during construction, according to the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. The biggest obstacle of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock their where the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up. All in all, the mooring mast over the Empire State Building was a genius idea, but too many obstacles sprung up for it to be in use.
0	4	4	Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.
0	3	3	Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there.
0	3	3	The idea of the Empire State building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay.
0	2	2	In the article ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. The obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced in @CAPS1 to Allow dirigible to dock there because people they was not gonna be safety. ""The owner of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york"". Another example why the builder faced in @CAPS1 to Allow dirigibles to dock there because ""open landing field could be weighted dow in in the back with lead weight, dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". The empire states was not very safe. This is why the builders of the empire state building faced in @CAPS1 to allow dirigible to dock there.
0	3	3	In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" To fix the problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building. Another problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, Lüsted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. To make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians."" In the end, people realized there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major problem was that the original Empire State Building, ""...could not simply drop a mooring mast,"" on the top of the building because the ""...single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work. One reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" This makes it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings. There was also, ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal to even dock airships on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles contain hydrogen which is ""highly flammable."" If the Hindenburg incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been ""much worse."" These reasons contributed to the builders' problems, and explain why the mooring mast was never used.
0	4	4	In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1.
0	3	3	In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow dirigibles (blimps) to station their for several hours. The architects faced many obstacles in trying to adding mast onto the design of the Empire State Building. One of these obstacles were remodifing the building, so the weight of the blimp wouldn't stress the foundation. ""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (¶ @NUM1) A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being dock at the top of the Empire State Building, was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized that this danger, on May 6, 1937.
0	0	0	The building was big and beatful.
0	3	3	To the Empire State building did have a flat roof but they cannot just drop the mooring mast on top of the roof because it would add stressed to the frame. To build a mooring mast the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars. Building a mooring mast would not be easy because the wind on top of the Empire state building would constantly change direction; therefore the dirigibles would be swirling around."" Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". Then there was a law that air craft should not fly too low over urban areas. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" For dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building had many obstacles.
0	3	3	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles they couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the empire state building. Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the bimp, then it would cause @MONEY1 of damage to the city.Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building. Drigibles are enormous steel framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building would let drigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or service. But, the stress of the drigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be sent all the way to the buildings Foundation. This cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to be made to the framework. In May 6, 1937 when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey the builders realized how catastrofick it would have been taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents and the back of the ship would constantly swing around. Also, the existing law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would make drigibles not allowed to moor at the Empire State Building. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building.
1	3	4	When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. This would cost over @MONEY1, and thats a lot. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting. This wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obsticle for the builders was saftey when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct.
1	3	2	Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress the the buildings frame. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modifi the buildings framework, this would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than doing that the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside. This would ""rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" -paragraph @NUM2. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles.
0	2	2	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the had to be modified and strengthened. This cost them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. They had to make these modifications so the dirigible can dock. All in All, these are the obstacles the builders of the Empire state building face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock.
0	3	3	One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. This was meant to help New York be a leader in modern traveling. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast. The idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street. Also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for and dirigible to tie up or even approach the area.
1	3	4	Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 ft on December 11, 1929. His plan was to build a mooring mast, at the top of the building to make it equiped for modern travel. The bulders faced three main obstacles, when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. When Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building became worried that a much worse accident would occur in New York.The second and greatest obstacle was nature. The winds was at the top of the building constantly shifted, which would cause the back of the dirigible swivel around the mast. The only way to solve this problem was with lead weights. This was not practical or safe.The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building.In conclusion, the three main obstacles that the builders faced were safety, nature, and the law.
0	0	0	The Empire State Building faced in attempting to build the highest Building in New york Because they wanted to be so big and they have been working on it for so menny years.
0	3	3	The Empire State Building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However this was not an easy task. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle overcome, @CAPS1 dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be achieved it was said to make the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However many problems occurred. The dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the buildings frame. The workers had to modify and strengthen the buildings framework. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken in consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor. The workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed. Although the workers succeeded on making a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never came to be.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers moring equipment had never been installed because, putting the workers having to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp in great danger. Also, the wind at the top of the building put workers at great risk of falling off, or dying
1	2	1	the Empire State building faced many problems.To dock a dirigible, It needed a good/safe dock site. Also, the wind so high up would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because It was extremely Flammable.
1	2	3	The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building.
0	3	3	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example, was the architects had to address the potential problem of the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law clearly would prohibit and make it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Dirigibles were designed to be ""moored in open landing fields"" and ""could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Another example, of an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to passengers and resident safety. The reason the landing of dirigibles were a potential threat to the entire population of New York City was that ""most dirigibles from outside United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the unpredictable winds the dirigible could sway and ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The architects of the Empire State Building were threatened by the possible obstacles of constructing a mooring mast atop the building.
0	3	3	Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the @CAPS1. S.B. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the @CAPS1.S.B. was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel. Dirigibles is an old word for Blimps. The obstacle the @CAPS1.S.B. had to over come were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay @MONEY1 in modifications on the @CAPS1.S.B. for the framework. The second was nature, the winds would make the back of the Dirigibles move around, they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe. Last but not least the law, the dirigibles cant be as low as the @CAPS1.S.B. because its too low and they cant fly low over urban areas.
0	3	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rodders and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon.A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.
0	2	2	In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst.
0	2	2	Based ON this excerpt the builders faced A few problems when building the Empire State Building. One problem was actually docking the Zeppelin's or dirigibles. The wind was vicious at @NUM1 ft in the Air. Another problem the buiders faced with saftey. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium it was A fire saftey issue. This occurred After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, ON may 6, 1937.
0	4	4	Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	2	2	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared.
2	4	2	In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area. If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful. It was a great idea. But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money.
0	1	1	The obstacles the buildes of the empire state building faced were that they had to make it strong. Also they had to be sure that the dirigibles wouldn't destroy the building when it landed. they also had to care ful that the dirigbles would crash in to the building when it was droping off the papers. An other obstacle for the workes was that the driagbles would not be able to land easily. Finally, they would have to make sure that nothing is out of place and working.
1	3	2	In a competition with architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since
0	3	3	While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building.
0	1	1	Some problems the designers faced, were the violent air currents that form in urban areas, this would be a problem because the dirigible would be tossed around due to it's light weight. Another problem, is the fact that it would be too dangerous to land a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City.
1	2	1	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it thyre. The dirigible could have caught fire and it would have been worse. It was dangerous to attach piece to the part.The high wind was a problem.The dirigible could burn up fall down and people would die below.
1	3	2	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. It was also dangerous to have them land there. It was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people.
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigles to dock there was because the dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.
0	3	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the reader learns about many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most important obstacle to overcome was safety. The United States used hydrogen rather than helium to power the dirigibles. As said in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic the accident would be if it was over a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2). The final obstacle the builders faced was that there was a law, ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles yet in the end, ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes"" (@CAPS2 @NUM4)
0	4	4	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would hurt the building's frame. Builders fix this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realize the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were away shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle given from the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire state Building, future obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose.
2	1	3	In the artical ""The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical workable arrangement and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The architects couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frames. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.
0	4	4	In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues included safety, nature and an existing law. Safety was the greatest obstacle. These dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the buildings in downtown New York stand so close together, one building such as the Empire State Building catching on fire could have devastating effects. The hardest problem to overcome would have been nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would have been impossible to keep the back of a dirigible from swiveling around. Also, the dirigibles would be hanging high above cars and people on the streets below. The last reason the dirigibles should not be moored at the Empire State building was because of a law that prohibited ""airships flying flying too low over urban areas."" This made the entire plan illegal, and although it was a good plan, it was not well thought out.
0	3	3	The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast.
0	3	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles also known as blimps to dock there. some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architecs could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below"". Also it was very unsafe allowing the highly flamable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area. Lastly the article states ""the greatest obsticle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast. Dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle above pedestrians.
1	2	3	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' to the worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, stated in paragraph @NUM2,
0	4	4	In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are out lined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law, Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is un desirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable.
0	2	2	While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. The Empire State Building *************** 
0	2	2	From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessable for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not low around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with.
1	2	1	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was that it wouldnt be able to tie cable tether, because it adds stress to the buildings frame. Also in the story they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommadate to the new situation.
0	2	2	The builders of the Empire State building had alot of problems in biulding the @CAPS1. How Would they be able to allow dirigables to @CAPS1 there? High Winds and laws stood in the biulders way. The fram of the building had to be renforced so it would not fall to the ground. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building scedual's.  Whe a dirigible did try to land it couldnt. The air streems were too much for it. In the end the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the @CAPS1 from ever being used.
0	3	3	In Marcia Amidon Lüsted excerpt The Mooring Mast, is about the empire state that was built to being the tallest building. There are copious of ways of the builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt it states,… ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This @CAPS1 proves how it's likely to destroy the whole entire empire state with Fire. Another @CAPS1 that portrays how builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there when it states,... ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was practical nor safe"". This @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the safty of the people walking on the @CAPS5 and what if they get hurt. finally another @CAPS1 that portrays the obtacles the builders faced when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This @CAPS1 proves if the dirigibles blow the empire it's not the only building in danger others around it too.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly shifting, so the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast.
0	4	4	In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a serious problem if the dirigible burst into flames and fire rained down on, ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind, which, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles would have to be, ""weighted down with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" This would be, ""neither practical nor safe."" because the weights could fall and kill people. The final obstacle for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the mooring mast faced many problems, ""that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.
1	2	1	They faced many problems when trying to dock there. It should never have been made in the first place. To many things were predictable. They had no landing gear, The wind was too great a factore, and the Ships couldent get close enough to The mast to dock.The people creating This over looked the possibility of it not working and only looked torde building it. They had no landing gears what so ever so it was hard to steady it and dock it. The wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around. The biggest thing was when they slowed it down and had no wind it still couldent get close enough to dock. Those are The @CAPS1 problems they faced.
1	4	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg accident in the highly populated New York City. Nature also restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped.
0	3	3	The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it's peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2). Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building.
1	4	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building.                                                                                                                                                                  Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights which also was not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building
1	2	3	While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" @CAPS1 so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a drigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened.
1	3	2	Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so that dirigibles could anchor there for refueling or service and let people on and off. In order to do this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars in modifications of the framework. Builders had to make it 102 floors and also create a glassed-in observation area along with an open observation platform, furthermore, they had to complete the roof and then move on to building the steel mast with glass windows. After all that time and money spent in re-creating the building, the dirigibles couldn't dock there. The wind was so strong that the back of the ship would always be moving. Also, there is a law that airships cant fly too low over urban areas. It wasn't worth it in the end.
0	2	2	As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger, so did the modifications they needed to make. To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon done with the help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the sky scraper would effect the frame. In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not over come.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader of a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Another set back is in paragraph @NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" Due to violent air current, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Tethering the mooring mast would do little help. Lead weights could not be used. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neighter practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles showed architects, the project at that time was impossible.
1	3	4	The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast
0	3	3	An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 was weight. If the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.
0	3	3	Al Smith, a former governor of New York had a brilliant idea to make the empire state building, the tallest building in the world.  He would put a mooring mast on the top to @CAPS1. dirigibles to the top so the dirigibles could let passengers off here.  But, this plan had many @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"".  This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself.  Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen.""  Hydrogen is a very flamable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk.  The third Reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas.
0	2	2	The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably.
0	0	0	one of the obstacles that had to face was they had to make it taller because it was sapoosed to be the tallest building. They also had problems with it so they had to keep fixing it.
1	2	3	The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the empire State building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered. This led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was complete they begin to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (line @NUM1) For, in dang this the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous, hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders dismay was 11 hundred ft. below. This resulted in @MONEY1 worth of modifications to the foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close engough to tie up because of  forceful winds"" (line @NUM2)
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there.
1	1	2	The builders of the empire state building attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was a fuetle effort. The tried a numerous amount of different ways to approach this idea. There were a few different theorie's on what would be best, and how to develope the Mooring Mast by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the empire state Building. This structure helped support the mooring are, where the dirigibles were docked. But the fate of the Mast was not to bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire state building was Never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is utterly true. And shows the work of the architects was never fully planned and over looked for the Mast to be durable.
0	1	1	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.  In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders spaced.  ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""  This is because the wind.  The wind would shift due to violent air currents.
0	3	3	In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attemp to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An accident where the German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed, shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would ""swivel"" around even if it was tethered. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of these examples would cause the builders to face obstacles.
0	4	4	In the article "" The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. ""... Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currets."" This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in, ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that soon never had the chance to come true.
1	4	3	One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safetly. According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe.       Last but not @CAPS1, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefor it would be impossible for a ship to land there.
0	3	3	In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock.
1	4	3	There would have been many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face if the decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from out side the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On @DATE1, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey. the owners realized how much worse it would have been is a place such as New York City.Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead wieght then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City.The final obstacle that biulders of the empire state @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the @ORGANIZATION1. They would not even be allowed to approach the @ORGANIZATION1.
0	1	1	The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. They will ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Also ""Dirigibles were docked by which means of an winch, @CAPS1 thats what they did and faced to dock there.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders.
1	2	3	There were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced one of them were redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty, they couldn't drop on mooring mass on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation.     The @CAPS1 had to modified and strengthened the steelframe in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame Also creating the rocket shaped mass the @CAPS1 had to work on many different parts. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. This had to be done presisely in order for everything towork     This were the obstacles the @CAPS1 face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State building.
1	4	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively.
1	2	1	Obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.
0	2	2	One obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back.Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flamable Being filled up with such a flamable gas it could easily turn into a disaster. Especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground.
1	2	3	In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire state building. @PERSON1 says in the excerpt ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame. So the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of thier building. Also because of everything that could happen to the building.
0	3	3	In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome.
1	2	1	There are afew obstacles the builders had. to face in this project. One of them was was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect building of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but make it something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (@NUM1 ¶ Al Smith) Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These things could go up two @NUM2 miles per hour. They were as long a 1 thousand ft. That would take up @NUM3 blocks New York City. They didn't have good landing area. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was always blowing. No matter what they need hangin dirigibles over a city of innocent people was very dangerous.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added mooring mast to increase the buildings height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building. Altogether this would cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and obstacle was safety. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe. The idea that landing dirigibles on top of the empire state building was neither safe or practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles for a plan like this to ever follow through.
0	4	4	In trying to build dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles. One reason is because ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) because it would only be held by ""a single cable tether"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1) which would add stress to the building. And the only way to fix would be to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" to strengthen it. Another obsticle was ""nature itself"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). This is because the winds would be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). And the one way to solve it would be to put lead weights to weigh down the back, but its not ""practical nor safe."" (@CAPS1. @NUM3) The last reason why is because of the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" so it would ""Make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to the building.
1	3	2	The Empire State building is known as the worlds tallest building. The building is located in New York. Al Smith the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State building was equipped for transportation. The transportation was dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al seen it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher @CAPS1 for flames. Also nature itself was a big problem the idea had safety problems and couldnt @CAPS1 flames in Downtown New York
0	1	1	Diregible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 The owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York        In The MOORING MAST          Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty mile per hour and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling some were as longht as four blocks in New york city The one obstacle to their expanded us in New york city was the lack of a Suitable landing area
0	1	1	Some of the Problems they faced building the emPire State building was the hight. building a buildig that high up and also epecting it to do things such as bording dirigibles. The @CAPS1 of the dirigible against the building could couse it to collapes. thats why The contractor to to re shape the Skeleton of the building.
1	2	3	It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the empire state building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure.       It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred.     Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph @NUM1).
0	3	3	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible @CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal.
0	3	3	To have a building built Over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimbs be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day the blimb is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread... Finally, blimbs could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover to low to urban areas. Those are many reasons why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM3). This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.
1	3	2	The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many obstacles while attempting to allowed dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1). The building would never be used for its transportational all purpose because of the dangers and obstacles of the mooring mast and dirigibles.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the stress of the building, and adding more to the top of the building would increase the stress. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to meet the needs. Also it would be over @MONEY1' worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe. ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" There was also a law that was in their way. Facing all these obstacles, caused the builders to not go through with this idea.
0	1	1	The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	4	3	The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state buildings flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds
1	3	2	The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 were the obstacles.
1	2	3	Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height their whirlwind issues that could push the derigible in undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). After the Hindenburg exploded the concerns for the same thing happening was a large safety concern. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2 Line 6)
1	4	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock attop the Empire state building, the builders were faced with obsticles. One obsticle they faced was the strong wind current. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Another obsticle was the added stress that would be put on the foundation of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate..."" as stated in paragraph @NUM2. A third obsticle the builders faced in this matter was the dangers of fire, as well as the chances of endangering those down below, which is discussed in paragraph @NUM3. One last obsticle faced by the builders was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM4). Those are just some of the many major obsticles faced by builders, attempting to dock dirigibles on the top of the then tallest building in the world.
1	3	4	The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were take place over the heads of people in New York city.Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk.Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law. The idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM1). Also, another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. For example on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown New York. (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast (paragraph @NUM3). The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the buildings framework because docking a dirigibles on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation of the building. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endager pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where difficult. One of the obstecles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building and the cost was high. For example in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The obstacles that the builders had to face made the idea impossible to happen.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
1	3	4	The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed.
1	3	4	The builders of the empire State Building faced many problems atempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were safety concerns. One issue was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flamable and explosive gas. A fire acident would be catastrophic, since down town newyork is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usualy is, because then thered be massive weighs dangling over the streets. With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, Dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed. That meant no attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles building the mast but they're biggest obstacle was lack of preparation, failure to address obvious problems.
0	3	3	From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", There were multiple obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders faced was the agianst airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough To tie up because of forceful winds."" The greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was the dirigible wasn't safe to have dangling high about pedestrians.
1	3	4	The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project.
1	4	3	The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph @NUM2, The author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. The builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast.
0	2	2	Al Smith had a great idea. When he thought he was going to have a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building. He had great creativity and wanted to use his building to full potential. Although there were many problems to this idea. One was the urban area below, many people lived in downtown New York City and it would be against the law to have zeppelins flying above the populated area. Another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it very hard to dock on the building. There were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on the top of the building.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstecals the builders faced were @CAPS1 concerns, high winds and the illegality of thier project.
0	3	3	The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were. one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger
1	4	3	The architects had to go through many obstacles such as having to rebuild the whole frame of the Empire State building. In paragraph nine it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 they had to modify and strengthened the whole thing to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they had to face, was that hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident like that could be worse in the crowded streets of New York. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around, but could be held down with lead weights, but like paragraph @NUM1 says ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling, is neither practical nor safe."" / Time
0	4	4	The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles.
0	4	4	Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1) and posed a threat to not only the passengers, but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" (paragraph @NUM2). A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State building was not a safe or practical one.
0	2	2	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles @CAPS1 the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the @ORGANIZATION1 law against airship flying too low over urban area. They try to get close but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approched the mooring but not get close. So they stablish a low to a securit for a urban Area.
0	3	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area. In the excerpt they said ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was the climate like wind pressure. For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Thats obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock.
1	4	3	Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. There needed to be modifications made to make it safe for a dirigible to land there. The biggest obstacle was nature. Lüsted said it best in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The final problem the builders faced was, even if they did manage to figure out a way to put the mooring mast up, there was still a law stating dirigibles illegal to land there. Lüsted said in paragraph @NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the Empire State building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced Problems to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some Problems were that most dirigibles from other countries are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, also The winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents and could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building. Another @CAPS1 the builders faced was a existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas, this law would make it illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building. They also had to spend @MONEY1 to upgrade the framework so it does not put to much strain on the top of the building.
0	2	2	There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.
2	3	1	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were one it was very windy so it was hard for the dirigibles to hook up to the gear. Anouther was the dirigibles very flamable so they were a danger to the city if the caught on fire. One other reason was it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first issue faced was that ""most of dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was an issue because if the dirigible would catch fire or explode over it highly populated city like New York, many people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders had to face was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when tethered to the mooring mast, making it impossible to board. This would also be dangerous for anyone aboard the airship. The third issue was that there ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With New York City certainly being an urban area this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, there were many obstacles faced by builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.
0	3	3	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition.
0	2	2	In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel which could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the buildings frame. Lüsted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen.
0	3	3	The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared.
0	4	4	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning preparation., The builders thought it would be a great idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock there. They didn't take into account the obstacles and struggles that they would soon face. The builder's didn't take into account the wind pressure and what the stress of the blimp's load would do to the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundered feet below."" This was a huge problem the architects and over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. ""Safety was also another big issue."" Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. The winds also were problem. Even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and could result in a dangerous accident. There was also laws against low flying ships. The architects For the Empire State Building should have thought it through.
0	3	3	In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constely shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. When building something always be prepared for obstacles.
0	3	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as there was a law preventing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Also they could not ancor down the back of the blimp, and due to the shifting winds that high it would not be safe for passangers to get on and off. The building also had to be rebuilt to be able to come close to staying stable with the dirigible attached. And last was the differences In gases used to keep the blimps afloat. most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flamable making in very unsafe. These are some of the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1	3	4	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was all so an existing law against these air ships.Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas.
0	3	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there- are The Steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work. Another obstacle that they faced is that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over suburban areas. The greatest obstacle is the violent air currents would make the back of the Ship swivel around the mooring mast.
0	3	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was that the winds at that height were alway changing and difficult to land a dirigible with. Also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even attempt to try it before they gave up. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""  It just wasn't made do that job so it wouldn't work.
2	3	1	Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast a top the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the frame work of the whole building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects design is shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside-."" @CAPS1, the building had to have two extra floors added one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigidle passengers. Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed the world's tallest building.
0	3	3	One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to @CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues.
1	1	2	In this excerpt there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they face were the dirigible and the sucess of the mooring mast. The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe. All in all these were the obstacles they had to face.
0	3	3	Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built.
0	3	3	There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for The Empire State Building.
0	4	4	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. The still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approached the building. The last obstacles the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangers that could be over a populated area. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigible to dock their.
0	1	1	Based on the excerpt I just read these are some of the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 one of the obstacles was the balloon becuz it had hellem and it was also flame abou. The secton obstacles is that you cantroll the balloon and the threed obstacles The Empire State Building had was a flat roof. and these are the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1.
0	3	3	There were many problems to over come in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to over come was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the buildings frame. This was solved by spending over @MONEY1 in modifying the building's frame work. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph @NUM1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around to much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three signifigant reasons the mooring mast failed.
1	2	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" @CAPS1 the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 shows the many obstacles architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0	3	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them.
0	4	4	While in the process of building the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. His first obstacle was the threat of title for worlds tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (paragraph @NUM1) ""The architecs would add @NUM2 dollers worth of modifications to the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was able to accomodate dirigibles saftey issues would be encountered. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable. After the disaster in New Jersey they did not want to take a chance. Next, with the wind above the building the air currents would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Lastly their is an existing that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. Which this would clearly violat. With all these obstacles to overcome the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded.
1	2	1	The greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violen air currents
1	0	1	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. So the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then tied it to a mast so by swinging the body the passengers could safely get on and off.
